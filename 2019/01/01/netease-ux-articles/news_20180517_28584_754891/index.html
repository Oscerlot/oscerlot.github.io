    <blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This article is a reprint from the WeChat public account “手游那些事” (shouyou naxie shi - “Those Things About Mobile Games”). The content is compiled from a collaborative course between NetEase Leihuo Games and Peking University, with Leihuo User Experience Center participating in the user research part of the sharing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is well known that NetEase’s MMO products have always performed very well, with many products firmly ranking at the top of the grossing charts. For example, one of its flagship products, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game, has been online for two years and still ranks in the top 10 of the Chinese App Store’s top-grossing games.</p>
<p>The secret of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, as a two-year-old “old game”, is still able to capture users lies in its social system. On the Internet, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game is jokingly referred to by some players as a large-scale social dating mobile game—this to some extent reflects the weight of the social system in this game. In the industry, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game has also been known for its excellent social design.</p>
<p>In the recent collaborative course between NetEase Leihuo Games and Peking University, Yao Yuan, the lead planner of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, shared her views on “the essence of game user experience” and the methods and principles of game social gameplay design; Liu Yongcheng, head of Leihuo UX User Experience Center, shared how UX business provides scientific data support for user experience design.</p>
<p>The following is a compilation of the content of the class:</p>
<h2 id="I-“Only-Attracting-Players-is-the-Only-Criterion-for-Judging-the-Excellence-of-a-Game”"><a href="#I-“Only-Attracting-Players-is-the-Only-Criterion-for-Judging-the-Excellence-of-a-Game”" class="headerlink" title="I. “Only Attracting Players is the Only Criterion for Judging the Excellence of a Game”"></a>I. “Only Attracting Players is the Only Criterion for Judging the Excellence of a Game”</h2><p>The user experience we usually talk about is about the user’s personal feelings, mainly emphasizing the user’s emotions and feelings. In a broad sense, user experience includes everything that players feel in the game, including visual experience, story experience, social experience, combat experience, growth experience, and so on.</p>
<p>There used to be a saying in game development: fun is the only criterion for testing a game. In Yao Yuan’s view, this statement is no longer suitable for current games. Attracting players is the only criterion for judging the excellence of a game.</p>
<p>How can we attract players? That is to meet the needs of users.</p>
<p>Yao Yuan led the audience to review the history of Richard Bartle, Nick Yee and others in the study of player needs and motivations. Based on the theory of evolution, she discussed the essence of games from a unique perspective—games are actually simulations of reality, and players are actually conducting preparedness environmental adaptation training. Starting from the essence of the game, Yao Yuan summarized the universal player needs into three points: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.</p>
<h2 id="II-How-to-Conduct-User-Experience-Design-from-a-Product-Perspective"><a href="#II-How-to-Conduct-User-Experience-Design-from-a-Product-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="II. How to Conduct User Experience Design from a Product Perspective?"></a>II. How to Conduct User Experience Design from a Product Perspective?</h2><p>Among the three player needs, relatedness is the most basic one. Relatedness is generated by social interaction, and in game design, social interaction is a very important part of user experience design.</p>
<p>So how does <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> design its social system? Yao Yuan mainly shared the following three points.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Interaction is Based on Player Identity Recognition, and Name is an Important Expression Tool</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It can be said that the social relationships of current domestic games are very complicated. Friends, mentors and apprentices, sworn brothers, couples, teams, groups… a wide variety, like a deluxe family bucket. However, in all current MMO games, these are already standard.</p>
<p>Everyone is doing social networking and wants to integrate all relationships into the game. But few people consider from the very beginning of game social interaction why social interaction is generated.</p>
<p>Yao Yuan first explained the essence of social interaction from a biological perspective: “When I was doing my Ph.D., I studied a kind of woodpecker. They are polygamous and live together without shame. During our research, we came up with a hypothesis that if this species has a highly socialized society, each of its individuals should be identifiable. Because only when individuals are identified can all their subsequent relationships, or strategies based on individuals, be possible. Therefore, the beginning of social interaction is the identification of identity. Identity is very important.”</p>
<p>Social interaction is based on identity recognition, so how is it reflected in the game? Yao Yuan took Chen Xinghan’s new work “Sky: Children of the Light” as an example to explain the importance of names for game player identity recognition.</p>
<p>In “Sky: Children of the Light”, everyone’s character looks the same. But when the player’s friendship with a character increases, the player can give the other party a name. “At this time, this person has a completely different meaning to you. You can see him from a long distance, and you can see him among a group of people, knowing that you have soared in the clouds together. For players in the game world, compared to the more versatile appearance, the name is a particularly good tool to express personal identity.”</p>
<p>In addition, Yao Yuan also shared an idea about setting the length of the name: “The space of mobile games is limited. If the name is too long, it will definitely affect the length of the information displayed later, and if it is too short, it will not be enough to express personal characteristics. But seven characters is a seven-character poem length for Chinese people, which is a very good format for players to name and express their inner feelings. Therefore, the name length of our <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game is finally set to seven characters, which is a little less than the PC version.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Social Immersion is More Important than Visual and Narrative Immersion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the game, making social connections is like the process of “establishing connections” described in “The Little Prince”. This process requires a certain social space, that is, it is necessary to give players a chance to settle their social relationships. “In the game, we need to let two people see each other and understand each other’s characteristics at the same time or in the same space, which can already provide them with a very good social space.”</p>
<p>How to use elements in the game to create a social space for players? Yao Yuan used the chat channel of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> as an example.</p>
<p>Due to the space limitations of the mobile game interface, most of the real-time games on the market will shrink the chat channel to a button on the main interface, and players will only see the chat channel when they click the button. But <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> places the chat channel at the bottom of the game’s main interface in order to enhance the player’s social immersion.</p>
<p>“Maybe the information displayed here is not enough, but for players, they can find that there are always active players talking in the world.” Usually, most games emphasize the immersion of game plots and visuals, but Yao Yuan believes that for MMORPG games, social immersion is much more important than immersion in visuals and stories.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Design Social Gameplay by Considering Players’ Emotional Needs and “Labeling”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game also has unique “tips” when designing social gameplay.</p>
<p>First of all, when making game content, it is necessary to consider its positioning and what kind of emotions and needs the players involved will have.</p>
<p>In class, Yao Yuan threw out a question: “If you design a wedding system in an online game, what content do you think should be put in?” As soon as the question came out, the students below spoke up. Some said that there should be a wedding parade, some said that there should be invitations and dresses—these are common elements of wedding systems in MMO games already on the market.</p>
<p>“Actually, we have implemented all the above functions in the game, but we have specially made a function in the wedding, that is, players can kill people in this scene.” Yao Yuan said an interesting setting in the wedding gameplay of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game. This answer is something most people did not expect.</p>
<p>“Actually, this is a strong interaction between players: to kill him. This is also the experience we have gained from playing games before: single players who come to watch the ceremony, out of the spirit of the FFF group, will especially want to kill the newlyweds; on the other hand, the newlyweds may also want to show ‘the couple work together, and their strength can break gold’—therefore, the wedding scene is often also a scene of tragedy, and all players have a very happy melee together.” This experience is to a certain extent similar to the process of guests making trouble in the bridal chamber in reality, achieving the same effect by “killing people”, so this seemingly strange gameplay can be recognized by players.</p>
<p>Secondly, when making social gameplay, it is necessary to add an emotional or experience label to the gameplay at the beginning of the design, as the basic purpose and principle of making this type of gameplay.</p>
<p>Regarding this method, Yao Yuan used the “Monk System” in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game as an example. From the PC version to the mobile version, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> will set up a “strange” “Monk System”: once the player feels that he has seen through the world of mortals, he can go to the abbot of Bao’en Temple to apply for monkhood. After becoming a monk, you can only sweep the floor, chant scriptures, and ring the bell in the temple. Most of the time, you cannot leave the scene, cannot complete daily tasks, cannot marry, cannot become sworn brothers, and cannot kill people.</p>
<p>In many cases, when players have the idea of churning in the game, they may not necessarily want to leave the game, but just need a way to vent their emotions, and to get some attention and comfort. Therefore, “becoming a monk” is actually a process for players to act like a spoiled child to their friends, and a way to meet the player’s need to “be valued”. This is reflected in the friend interaction in the “Monk System”: for example, when player A becomes a monk, the system will push this message to his friends, and friends can redeem the monk player by donating incense money. This system sounds completely “anti-social”. Apart from gaining an immersive experience of “becoming a monk”, this system is negative for social interaction and even for game experience. So why design such a system? What kind of emotional label is given to it? The answer is something that many people can’t think of—Tsundere.</p>
<p>In addition, Yao Yuan also used the question-answering system in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game with “recognition” and “topic” as labels, the imperial examination system with “timeliness” as a label, and the guild flower battle gameplay with “noise” as a label to illustrate the importance of labeling when designing social gameplay.</p>
<p>When all the labels are integrated, it will eventually create a <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> social system formed by real players, with its unique game temperament. Compared to a sophisticated and luxurious but indifferent metropolis, it is more like a small town full of human touch—you often meet acquaintances on the street, and you can chat about gossip when you meet. In the real world, this feeling may only be rooted in the memories of our parents or when we were young. But in the world of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, it belongs to the young people’s world, rooted in Chinese culture, and has a lively and bustling atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the end, Yao Yuan summarized how to start to improve the player’s game experience:</p>
<p>First, we need to analyze the needs of players and recognize the needs of players.</p>
<p>Second, we ourselves must also actively practice and invest in experiencing the game, and iterate the game based on the feedback of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Third, any design we make must be based on rational analysis, including emotional experience factors are also part of our rational analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, please remember, “The player is always your best friend.” Stand with the users, understand their needs, and put people first, this is the foundation of all user experience design.</p>
<h2 id="III-UX-Business-Provides-Scientific-Data-for-User-Experience-Design"><a href="#III-UX-Business-Provides-Scientific-Data-for-User-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="III. UX Business Provides Scientific Data for User Experience Design"></a>III. UX Business Provides Scientific Data for User Experience Design</h2><p>After Yao Yuan talked about game user experience and the design of social gameplay in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> from the product direction, Liu Yongcheng, head of Leihuo User Research Center, explained how UX business systematically forms user experience support from the perspective of the work of the user experience department. “The product is a decision-maker, and the user experience is a supporter. User experience is also the last specialized game profession to enter the game industry in the entire game industry.”</p>
<p>The work goal of the user experience department is to use scientific methods to form qualitative and quantitative data to provide decision support, thereby connecting players and game development groups.</p>
<p>Liu Yongcheng said that during the testing period of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game, the user experience department conducted several tests, continuously analyzing the causes of player churn, public opinion, player behavior in the game, game problems, and the highlights of alternative competing products, and visualized them through the data platform. These have played a very important role in the design of the game’s social gameplay and the improvement of the product.</p>
<p>From the content of Yao Yuan and Liu Yongcheng’s lectures, the reasons for the success of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game in game social interaction can ultimately be attributed to two major aspects—people-oriented social design concepts and scientific user experience data.</p>
