<p>The “Service Innovation Design” course is jointly organized by NetEase Leihuo User Experience Center and the Department of Industrial Design of Zhejiang University. This course will last for three months and will be taught in 20 sessions. The course focuses on how to combine game products, offline game scenarios, and game users through service design, and cultivates students’ service design capabilities through theoretical explanations and case analysis. The final results will be exhibited at Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 22, the eleventh lecture of “Service Innovation Design”: Agile Concepts and Planning, was held as scheduled in the Department of Industrial Design of Zhejiang University. This course was taught by a PM from the Leihuo User Experience Center, mainly explaining in detail from three parts: basic concepts of agile development, how to build an “agile” team, and thinking and planning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the course, the teacher used “Deadline is the primary productive force” and “Game of Thrones’ anti-climatic ending” as examples to introduce the need for reasonable planning: Waterfall Development and Agile Development, which brought bursts of laughter from the students present. The course unfolded in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>The teacher first explained the basic concepts of Waterfall Development and Agile Development.</p>
<p>Waterfall Development, like a waterfall, has strict hierarchical steps. It is the most typical predictive method, strictly following the pre-planned steps of requirements analysis, design, coding, integration, testing, and maintenance. The advantages are clear and visualized progress, and simple progress management. The disadvantage is the extremely high cost of rework or change.</p>
<p>The teacher gave intuitive examples of industrial assembly lines and house construction to help students understand Waterfall Development.</p>
<p>One day, a pig and a chicken were walking down the road. The chicken said to the pig, “Hey, how about we start a restaurant together?” The pig looked back at the chicken and said, “Good idea, what do you want to name the restaurant?” The chicken thought for a moment and said, “How about ‘Ham and Eggs’?” “No way,” said the pig, “I’d be committed, but you’d only be involved.”</p>
<p>Then, the teacher used this joke to introduce Agile Development (Scrum). The pig team members are equivalent to the developers, and the chicken team members are equivalent to the users and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Agile development takes the evolution of user needs as the core, and adopts an iterative and gradual method for software development.</p>
<p>In order to help students more intuitively understand the difference between Waterfall Development and Agile Development, the teacher used “arranged marriage by parents” to describe the rigid and strict procedures of Waterfall Development, and “free love” to describe the flexible and free nature of Agile Development. Laughter of agreement came from the students again.</p>
<p>Advantages of Agile Development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid response to change:</strong> Prioritize what to do first, adapt to unexpected needs.</li>
<li><strong>Shorter delivery cycle:</strong> Continuously optimize and improve the product.</li>
<li><strong>Project transparency:</strong> Members and stakeholders can see the progress and problems of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Low trial and error cost:</strong> Even if a sprint has problems, the manpower and material resources wasted will not be much.</li>
<li><strong>High return on investment:</strong> Fast output and low cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>“2334, please remember these four numbers.” The teacher said to the students when explaining how to build an “agile” team.</p>
<p><strong>2 Tools:</strong></p>
<p>A Kanban board is generally a physical whiteboard, the purpose of which is to visualize and track iteration progress and collaborate. The Kanban board needs to display everyone’s tasks in the corresponding status (To Do&#x2F;Not checked out, Doing&#x2F;Checked out, Done), generally using sticky notes.</p>
<p>A burndown chart is a visual representation of the work that needs to be completed before the project is finished. A burndown chart has a Y-axis (work) and an X-axis (time). Ideally, the chart is a downward curve, and as the remaining work is completed, it “burns down” to zero.</p>
<p><strong>3 Roles:</strong></p>
<p>PO: Product Owner, generally a product manager, responsible for requirements analysis and organization, decomposition and acceptance of stories, maintenance of the Product Backlog, etc.</p>
<p>Scrum Master: Plays the role of a facilitator, responsible for hosting meetings, assisting team members in solving difficulties, resolving external interference with the team, and communicating with the outside world. The Master can be a dedicated person, or it can be a member of the team. In many teams, the PO also serves as the Master.</p>
<p>Dev Team: The entire development and testing team, including UI designers and all other relevant personnel.</p>
<p><strong>3 Artifacts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product Backlog: Product requirement pool</li>
<li>Sprint Backlog: The set of requirements to be developed this time</li>
<li>Potentially Shippable Product Increment: Deliverable results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4 Meetings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Requirements review meeting and iteration kickoff meeting. In this meeting, the following conclusions need to be reached:<ul>
<li>All members have a clear and concise iteration goal.</li>
<li>Clarify all requirements and technical implementation risks.</li>
<li>Evaluate the workload required and the personnel to be invested.</li>
<li>Determine all the final features and workload to be released. The Story needs to be broken down into Tasks, in units of hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum Planning:</strong> Daily stand-up meeting. As the name suggests, it is a meeting held standing up. Everyone forms a circle or a semicircle. There are two purposes for doing this, one is efficiency, and the other is to make it easier for all team members to see each other.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> Iteration review meeting. The main content of this meeting is for stakeholders and team members to show the functional increments of this iteration. It should be noted that unfinished functions are not displayed, and PPT is not needed. Record relevant feedback after the demonstration.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> Iteration review meeting. The main purpose of the meeting is to review the overall situation of this iteration. All members must participate, review the good things done in this iteration and the areas that need improvement, and propose improvement measures for these areas that need improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last part of thinking and planning, the teacher mainly explained the Mandala thinking method, mind mapping, and how to plan, and practiced the Mandala thinking method with the classification of <em>The 36 Stratagems</em>.</p>
<p>The Mandala thinking method is also known as the nine-square grid thinking method. After listening carefully to the teacher’s explanation, the students discussed in groups and showed their classification of the thirty-six stratagems.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, the teacher once again emphasized to the students the core of Agile Development: “Embrace change!” The students responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>
