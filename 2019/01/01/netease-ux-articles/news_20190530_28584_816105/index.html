<p>Qualitative research is one of the commonly used methods in user research. Although, in games, we have a large amount of game logs to conduct various data analyses and obtain more accurate results, data is often only a result and an appearance. We are more interested in knowing the underlying reasons behind the data, that is, why such data results are produced.</p>
<p>Telephone interviews, in-depth interviews, street intercepts, and focus groups are the four qualitative research methods we commonly use.</p>
<h2 id="Telephone-Interviews"><a href="#Telephone-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="Telephone Interviews"></a>Telephone Interviews</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Faa9eb44a-e286-47eb-89d9-94d6fe317b22.jpg/size/" alt="Telephone Interview"></p>
<p><em>(Image from the Internet)</em></p>
<p>Generally, for products that already have a certain user base, such as products that have been launched or are being tested, the telephone interview method can be used for some special research topics. The advantage of this method is that there is no venue restriction, and the cost of acquiring players is relatively low. However, the disadvantage is that it is impossible to observe the players’ real game experience, and it is necessary to carefully distinguish the authenticity of the players’ feedback.</p>
<h2 id="In-depth-Interviews"><a href="#In-depth-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="In-depth Interviews"></a>In-depth Interviews</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fda149520-d2b0-4fa5-b140-d57fb91d469b.jpg/size/" alt="In-depth Interview"></p>
<p>In-depth interviews are generally combined with laboratory tests or other tests. Generally, we invite players to participate in designated venues and pay a certain amount of compensation. This type of interview, first of all, has certain requirements for the players themselves, such as game experience, occupation and other demographic information; secondly, it has high requirements for time and venue, because the test not only needs to provide players with a comfortable environment, but may also involve the participation of multiple parties such as products, user researchers, and players, so coordination is required. Because in-depth interviews provide players with compensation, players are more willing to cooperate, but relatively, the feedback will be more positive. Therefore, when conducting in-depth interviews, do not over-interpret players’ ratings of products.</p>
<h2 id="Street-Intercepts"><a href="#Street-Intercepts" class="headerlink" title="Street Intercepts"></a>Street Intercepts</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fed000c6a-618c-4cdd-abc1-2b682fc1d0f4.jpg/size/" alt="Street Intercept"></p>
<p>Suitable for product evaluation in the demo period. Generally, according to certain game experience, occupation and other demographic information, players are directly invited on the street to watch game videos or try them out, and give certain feedback. Unlike in-depth interviews, this street research method generally does not provide players with compensation, or players do not know in advance that they can receive compensation. Therefore, players’ behavior is more real and closer to market performance. However, because there are many uncontrollable factors in external testing, this method also has disadvantages: the experience interview time is generally short, and it is difficult to find target players, like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<h2 id="Focus-Groups"><a href="#Focus-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Focus Groups"></a>Focus Groups</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fcdae42f1-768e-4933-8dde-83bb89d95825.jpg/size/" alt="Focus Group"></p>
<p>Generally, a small-scale symposium is used to select a group of relatively “similar” players, and the host conducts interviews in an unstructured or semi-structured manner. It is generally used to understand the attitude of a specific group of players towards a certain gameplay or concept. Through interaction and discussion with each other, players can often stimulate more new ideas and viewpoints. However, it should be noted that there may be “opinion leaders” or relatively introverted players among the players, so there are higher requirements for the host’s ability to control the scene.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction to the four qualitative research methods we commonly use in the user research process. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the actual work process, it is also necessary to choose the appropriate method according to specific needs.</p>
