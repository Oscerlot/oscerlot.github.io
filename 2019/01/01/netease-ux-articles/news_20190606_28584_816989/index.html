<p>In the last sharing session, I introduced the sharing by Li Yue, a senior user experience designer at Didi CDX, “Making Good Use of the [Experience + Data Dual-Drive Model] to Deduce Good Design”, which mainly elaborated on the important role of the 5 Whys method of design inquiry in excavating the essential needs of the product or planning party at the initial stage of design. In this sharing, I will talk about how design communication should be carried out in the design process based on another IXDC workshop.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-Talk-About-Design-Communication"><a href="#Let’s-Talk-About-Design-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Talk About Design Communication"></a>Let’s Talk About Design Communication</h2><p>This design communication workshop was prepared by Dhaval Joshi, a senior product manager at Tencent, and Suxi Chen, an interaction designer. It mainly derives content about design communication through the problems encountered in their VR live broadcast design process. I think the main gain is how to carry out work in unknown field design, and secondly, to learn how to organize feedback from different states in the design process.</p>
<p>Dhaval Joshi started with V+ live broadcast. V Society is one of the earlier companies to use VR and other technologies to do game e-sports, and it performed well in the Dota2 international competition. Inspired by this, Tencent also hopes to provide a new immersive experience for its LOL fans and users through the mobile VR e-sports live broadcast experience, to create new ways to reach fans and provide new channels to attract users.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, in the traditional development process, design, development, and testing cooperate with each other through a linear process to complete the requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F0a5da94a-5419-4105-afe1-404506913bb4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;0a5da94a-5419-4105-afe1-404506913bb4.jpg"></p>
<p>However, when targeting VR, a new form of interaction, they suddenly found that everyone did not know how to achieve the best performance of this new media, and their design performance and communication were not easily understood by others, because product managers and programmers did not have a unified understanding of VR performance.</p>
<p>Faced with VR, a new medium, they first started by positioning the characteristics of VR itself. We know that in real life, everyone watches games on the sidelines of the stadium (as shown in the figure below), facing a large space. What VR virtual reality can bring us is to reconstruct this space, so that everyone can be immersed in the scene without leaving home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2Fd55929aa-f29e-4251-8235-6bdb2ea13d3b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;d55929aa-f29e-4251-8235-6bdb2ea13d3b.jpg"></p>
<p>Then, since mobile VR on mobile platforms generally adopts a head-mounted technology form, the operation will not adopt the form of touch screen. Therefore, there are two key points in VR design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F44c1b785-ff03-4a56-ba31-c2612468e3d9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;44c1b785-ff03-4a56-ba31-c2612468e3d9.jpg"></p>
<p>Therefore, for this kind of three-dimensional space design, they creatively adopted a new way of expression to facilitate communication. as the picture shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2Fdf32eafa-6647-4ce3-9371-8d2f4347239f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;df32eafa-6647-4ce3-9371-8d2f4347239f.jpg"></p>
<p>Then, use low-fidelity to directly let the program quickly implement an interactive version for testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F13fd0a37-7a0f-4e25-97aa-e993cc9b3c51.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;13fd0a37-7a0f-4e25-97aa-e993cc9b3c51.jpg"></p>
<p>Through this case, we can clearly see how important simulation is in design communication. Only when the participants understand and synchronize the information between each other can they get what the designer wants in the design implementation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F7fb47033-f68a-4663-8e47-d13ca3bba8d9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;7fb47033-f68a-4663-8e47-d13ca3bba8d9.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Translation-Model"><a href="#Translation-Model" class="headerlink" title="Translation Model"></a>Translation Model</h2><p>Another gain for me is about the translation model. Tencent’s designers use it to translate the interaction form and scene they set into a language that the program can easily understand. But I personally think that this is actually very suitable for complex systems like games to sort out various states and feedback. As shown in the figure below, the translation model is to number each element after completing the basic interaction framework, and then sort out the feedback of all other elements after triggering one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F7ea26a79-effb-4e2d-96ff-5ebf4ae4c3da.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;7ea26a79-effb-4e2d-96ff-5ebf4ae4c3da.jpg"></p>
<p>Through this operation, it can ensure that the designer does not miss the state when outputting content to the greatest extent, and can enrich the performance of the interface and think of ideas that were not thought of during previous designs. Of course, this method also has disadvantages. If the interface is particularly complex, the efficiency will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the number of compressed element numbers should also be considered.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>To review, design communication is an indispensable and important part of design communication. In the design process, how to make product managers, developers and other relevant personnel understand the design content and clarify the design goals is the key problem to be solved by design communication. Simulation is a good way. Through simulation, developers and product managers can actually participate in and experience the design, and then it is easier to understand the design ideas and unify ideas.</p>
<p>Designers, especially interaction designers, often pay more attention to the various states of design. Through the translation model, it is more convenient for designers to sort out feedback and states in the later stage to prevent omissions.</p>
