</blockquote>
<p>Do you often say to your friends in daily games, “Just 20 more minutes” or “Just one more round”? This kind of scenario where it’s hard to let go in the game is actually a common manifestation of our investment in the game, and even indicates that we may be “addicted” to the game. So today, let’s talk about the “Hook Model” theory that makes us addicted to games from the perspective of game interaction designers.</p>
<p>The “Hook Model” is a product design method proposed by Nir Eyal in <em>Hooked</em> that can engage users and gradually make them dependent. It mainly includes four steps: trigger, action, reward, and investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F0809a9a0-4a3b-42e8-b4eb-98185f93473a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;0809a9a0-4a3b-42e8-b4eb-98185f93473a.jpg"></p>
<p>These four steps are a cyclical process. The more users are immersed in this cycle, the stronger the attraction of your product design. Conversely, when users stop this cycle, as a designer, you need to consider at which stage the user encountered a problem, why it did not meet the user’s expectations, and how to make the product design closely connected with the user’s behavior habits and emotional state.</p>
<h2 id="Trigger"><a href="#Trigger" class="headerlink" title="Trigger"></a>Trigger</h2><p>Everything is difficult at the beginning. The first step is to trigger the user to be motivated to use your product, which is called a trigger. As the first step in habit formation, triggers need to use pain points and needs to make users have expectations and attention. Therefore, as a designer, you need to clearly convey the user’s needs and desired goals to the user, arouse the user’s sense of participation. When designing, you not only need to display the user’s short-term goals, but also the display of long-term goals is extremely important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Fe7542f31-82a1-47dc-ada3-7d2ad0dbe702.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;e7542f31-82a1-47dc-ada3-7d2ad0dbe702.jpg"></p>
<p>In <em>Shenmu</em> (神都夜行录), the sign-in interface displays the special reward for the 10th day of sign-in - Jade Bi - independently. While giving users a higher goal, it also reminds users and stimulates them to log in again every time they sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F251f14b9-dfdf-4070-a51c-cfaeebaada7c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;251f14b9-dfdf-4070-a51c-cfaeebaada7c.jpg"></p>
<p>When the goal is too long-term to be achieved quickly, the user will not see the goal feedback at the beginning, so after a long time, they will become bored, which reduces the motivation to open the product. The sign-in goal in <em>Onmyoji</em> is relatively long-term, but when designing, the long-term goal is broken down into multiple more achievable phased small goals, which can better stimulate user motivation.</p>
<h2 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h2><p>After the previous stage triggered the user, in this stage we need the user to take effective action. The difficulty of taking action will directly affect the possibility of the user continuing the game. Therefore, it is necessary to meet the user’s psychological expectations, ensure that the core behavior entry is obvious, and high-frequency behavior operations are easy to implement. This stage requires us to sort out the user’s usage path, delete unnecessary operations, reduce the user’s action cost, and make the product design efficient and easy to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F504e7372-4b6e-48bb-b22a-a439a2c76da5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;504e7372-4b6e-48bb-b22a-a439a2c76da5.jpg"></p>
<p>The main task prompt of <em>Idol Company</em> (拜托了经纪人) is permanently displayed on the main interface in a differentiated and prominent form. When you click to open the task details, you can click to directly jump to the corresponding function interface for operation. For example, you can directly enter a certain story chapter, or you can jump to the card development interface, etc., greatly reducing the user’s operation path and improving the user’s operation efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F623d8e9d-9ebc-4c5e-8690-18a49e26d016.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;623d8e9d-9ebc-4c5e-8690-18a49e26d016.jpg"></p>
<p>Dungeon-type games are usually repetitive and mechanical gameplay, mainly reflected in the scene, tasks, and operations. When designing, it is necessary to provide automated functions to reduce repetitive interfaces and save user operation time. For example, in <em>Samurai Shodown</em>, when the dungeon ends, in the area that is easy to operate on the horizontal screen, the function of challenging again is provided, reducing the threshold of action to improve the efficiency of clearing dungeons.</p>
<h2 id="Reward"><a href="#Reward" class="headerlink" title="Reward"></a>Reward</h2><p>In addition to the ease of use of the product, the product must also be able to provide a variety of potential incentives to maintain the user’s interest, so that the user’s behavioral motivation can be satisfied, and the user’s desire to continue using it can be increased. When designing, it is necessary to grasp the user’s behavioral needs, give timely prompts and feedback, and let the user’s behavior have rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Fe1471130-9baa-4ab0-93f1-4df2238384a2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;e1471130-9baa-4ab0-93f1-4df2238384a2.jpg"></p>
<p>In the ranking settlement of <em>QQ Speed</em>, the change in rank points is used to bring a sense of achievement to the user, and it also shows the change in the ranking of the user’s current rank points among the national users, which can further stimulate the user’s comparison psychology, so as to continuously carry out the ranking gameplay to surpass others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F12e2f833-1368-4a97-8d4b-7ab80b880708.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;12e2f833-1368-4a97-8d4b-7ab80b880708.jpg"></p>
<p>Social showing off is also one of the driving user behavior methods in rewards. In the settlement interface of <em>Peacekeeper Elite</em>, in addition to strengthening the display of MVP user information, it also shows the achievements of the team users in the current game, so that users can use the achievements obtained as a capital to show off to other users and gain recognition, regardless of whether their performance is the most prominent in this game.</p>
<h2 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h2><p>Investment refers to the time, energy, money, etc. that users invest in the product. In order to make users have psychological expectations and take action, it is necessary to strengthen the user’s cognition that the more investment, the better the service, and cultivate users to become loyal users. When designing, it is necessary to guide users to use the product again, and encourage users to continue to invest in the product to improve stickiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Ff9c67c1c-b8d6-4dc7-a58e-c883d6a7c71a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;f9c67c1c-b8d6-4dc7-a58e-c883d6a7c71a.jpg"></p>
<p>Whether it is a mobile game or an end game, the in-game mall and coupons are just needs of users. When <em>Honor of Kings</em> induces consumption and recharge, it insights into the user’s consumption tendency psychology and shows the difference in the recharge stage, so that users can clearly continue to recharge. It can bring about changes in the noble level and have more game privileges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F976ea91b-8787-46cf-85b4-3e31eb71fe93.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;976ea91b-8787-46cf-85b4-3e31eb71fe93.jpg"></p>
<p>Users tend to overestimate the results of their labor input, so the more input, the more it can increase the user’s sense of exclusivity and self-identity. When <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em> (lit. “Meeting Nishuihan”) ends the travel function, it prompts the rewards that can be obtained and the rewards that have not yet been obtained, accurately showing the gap brought about by different investments, and encouraging users to increase investment time to bring more rewards.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The “Hook Model” guides users to participate through goals, reduces user payment behavior, and gives feedback after each payment, and finally improves product stickiness through user payment. When designing, it is necessary to grasp the user’s pain points, plan the user’s behavior path, give users a sense of psychological satisfaction, and then continue to stimulate users to cycle investment, so that users are addicted to it will naturally be a matter of course.</p>
