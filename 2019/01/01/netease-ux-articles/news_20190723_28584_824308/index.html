<p>Electronic games have developed for more than half a century, from arcades, consoles, handhelds, PCs to mobile games. Electronic games have gone through five generations with the update and iteration of technology.</p>
<p>As software running on mobile phones, mobile games have simple application scenarios and low operation thresholds, thus greatly promoting the expansion and popularization of the game market, making more and more people become mobile game players. Mobile games are divided into portrait and landscape modes, which mainly depend on usage habits and gameplay.</p>
<p>In Japan, players are more accepting of the portrait display of games. According to survey reports and the top-selling mobile games in Japan, a large proportion of the top 100 games are portrait games.</p>

<p>As we all know, the pace of life and work of Japanese people is quite fast. Excluding this time, there is very little time for daily entertainment, and the fragmented time that can be controlled by themselves is concentrated when taking transportation.</p>
<p>Japan’s transportation system is very developed, and the subway and Shinkansen networks are all over the country, which has also become the main mode of travel for Japanese people. During the rush hour of commuting, it is not easy to hold the railing with one hand and the briefcase with the other, and to free up one hand to operate the mobile phone. The two-handed holding requirement of landscape games is obviously inappropriate.</p>

<p>In contrast, the portrait operation that can be controlled with one hand solves this problem well. Game manufacturers will be precise to the distribution of keys, the position of option arrangement and other details on the basis of portrait display.</p>
<p>Considering all these limitations and opportunities, mobile game developers use the power of the mobile platform to optimize the experience brought by portrait and one-handed control methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>In the area map showing the comfort of the thumb, we can experience the comfort of clicking and sliding the thumb on the mobile phone screen. Here we analyze the right-handed users, and left-handed users can flip over and understand in reverse.</p>
<p>Due to the length limitation of the thumb, the lower right corner area is relatively easy to click, while the top and lower left corner are the most difficult areas to click. Due to the relatively weak operability in portrait mode, game manufacturers mainly focus on casual games in the game category, but of course it is not limited to this.</p>

<p>From our existing experience, landscape games have always accounted for the majority in the domestic market, because the left and right expansion of the landscape can present a broader picture scene, and naturally contain richer elements.</p>
<p>Moreover, the arrangement of domestic books and printed matter is from left to right, which conforms to the reading habits of Chinese people. In landscape games, it is easy to accept the information replacement in the left and right directions due to reading habits. For example, in horizontal platformer games that constantly move to the right, the newly emerging scene elements can be noticed and information can be received at the first time.</p>
<p>In addition, some games also use the gravity sensor for rotation operations. Although portrait mode sometimes only requires one-handed operation, in order to maintain balance, the other hand is also needed for assistance, holding with both hands.</p>
<p>When holding with both hands in portrait mode, the center of gravity is not in the middle of the two hands. It takes more effort to reach a stable state than when the center of gravity is in the middle of the two hands in landscape mode. Therefore, the way of holding the mobile phone with both hands in landscape mode is more suitable for this type of game.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of smartphones, the size of mobile phone screens is gradually increasing, and one-handed operation has begun to become difficult, making mobile games gradually develop in the direction of landscape mode.</p>

<p>There is no end to the pursuit of humanization and ease of use in experience design, and the same is true for game products. There is room for thinking behind every familiar operation, and every improvement in user experience is accumulated by seemingly insignificant detail changes. In the field of “games”, which inherently represents “interaction”, this should be even more so.</p>
