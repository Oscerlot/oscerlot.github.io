<p>Last time we talked about the first level of becoming an interview master:</p>
<p><strong>Being a Good Voice for the Players</strong></p>
<p>Let’s review some key points of the first level of being an interview master.</p>
<p>The keyword for being a good voice for the players in the first level of interviewing is “deconstruction”.</p>
<p>How to deconstruct?  Because players don’t have the professional ability to break down problems, we need to guide them step by step within a framework to discover the root of the issues, gradually mapping the players’ feedback to the game design.</p>
<p>Accumulating these frameworks requires playing games regularly and doing more game deconstruction thinking when problems are discovered.</p>
<p>Besides understanding basic interview question deconstruction, what other abilities are needed to conduct a good interview?  Today, let’s talk about the second level of interviewing:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Players</strong></p>
<p>First, let’s look at an example. In a test, two players had completely different feedback on the same content of the same game:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Player 1</th>
<th align="left">Player 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">“This game is way too easy!”</td>
<td align="left">“This game is way too hard!”</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, with this kind of test result, should we suggest the developers make it easier or harder?</p>
<p>Don’t rush to a conclusion.  Let’s first find out who these two players are.</p>
<p>It turns out that the player who said the game was easy is a veteran player with T2 level game operation ability, while the player who said the game was too difficult is a casual player.</p>
<p>It can be seen that players with different backgrounds will bring completely different feedback.</p>
<p>In our interviews, to understand <em>why</em> someone gives specific feedback, we need to further understand what kind of player they are, including their gaming background, educational background, and even their lifestyle.</p>
<p>A person’s past cognition, experience, needs, and attitudes often determine some of their present and future behaviors. The behavior shown by the player and the feedback expressed are just the tip of the iceberg. We need to dig out the underlying needs and motivations under the iceberg.</p>
<p>So, when understanding a player, what information do we usually collect?</p>
<p>This can be divided into two categories: one is demographic characteristics, and the other is game characteristics.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Demographic Characteristics:</strong> Demographic information, income level, time characteristics, gaming environment, cultural environment, etc.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Game Characteristics:</strong> Previous game experience, game interests, social habits, operational ability, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some common player characteristics:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Time Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>This mainly refers to the player’s occupation. Generally, we will divide players into working professionals, students, and freelancers. The free time characteristics of these three types of players are very obvious. Office workers generally work during the day and play games at night, while students are more active on weekends and holidays, and freelancers are often the “time warriors” in the game. When players report that there are too many or too few activities, it’s helpful to understand their occupation.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Income Level:</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, high-spending players don’t care about how much money they spend. They are more concerned about how long it will take to fill the “pit”. Many high-spending players are impatient and want to max out their gems and pets in one day.  Casual players and low- to mid-spending players are more sensitive to prices, especially for newly opened numerical sinks, and price increases of some items can be expected to receive a large amount of complaints the next day. Therefore, what needs to be noted here is that it is necessary to understand which player segment an activity or some cultivation content is targeting.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Game Interests:</strong></p>
<p>In the same game, different players have very different interests. Some players like to find people to PK and fight everywhere in the game, while others like to roam the map and enjoy the scenery in a more relaxed way. Different gameplay activities also have their own labels. If the label of a gameplay does not match the label of a certain player, then this gameplay may not be well received by the player even if there is no problem in design. Therefore, research on a certain gameplay also needs to find the core players of this gameplay to do some interviews. For example, for a PK-type gameplay, more feedback on combat experience can be obtained from PK-type players, and they can even help you analyze the balance of professions. But if you encounter a casual player, you may get feedback that this gameplay is not interesting and the rewards are not rich enough.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Different Operational Abilities:</strong></p>
<p>This should have been deeply understood in the example at the beginning. Before the game test, we generally use questionnaires to measure the player’s operational ability, and then look at their feedback in combination with their operational ability. So if you encounter the two opposite types of feedback mentioned above, whether the game should be made more difficult or easier depends on what kind of players the core target audience of this game is. If you want to cover those ordinary players with not very high operational ability, then the game will inevitably need to reduce the difficulty; if the game itself has a difficulty threshold and is known for its difficulty, then it needs to stick to itself. After all, a game does not have to meet the needs of everyone. Just strive to give players who like this type of game the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>The above is the content of the second level of being an interview master.</p>
<p>To review, the second level of becoming an interview master is:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Players</strong></p>
<p>Why do you need to understand your players? Because every game, every game content has its preset core target group, and collecting feedback from the corresponding core players can better help improve the game or the game content.</p>
<p>When understanding a player, we generally start with their demographic characteristics and game characteristics. In detail, it will also include demographic information, income level, time characteristics, game environment, cultural environment, previous game experience, game interests, social habits, operational ability, etc. As for when you need to understand which characteristics of the player, it depends on the characteristics of the core target group mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So, in summary, we have already finished talking about the two levels of becoming an interview master. Some people may ask, what is the third level? The place to practice the third level is here:</p>
