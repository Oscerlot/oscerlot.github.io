</blockquote>
<p>Today, we’ll talk about the UI design of game systems. “Systems” refer to functional modules in the game, such as the guild system in MMOs or the team system in MOBAs.</p>
<p>System design is generally carried out during the mid-stage of game development, when the core gameplay is basically established, and various peripheral systems are gradually added. Systems often imply multiple interfaces and multiple usage scenarios.</p>
<p>Because of the existence of these complex functional modules, there is a difference between interaction designers and visual designers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interaction designers focus on the design of multiple interfaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visual designers focus on the design of single interfaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Facing a complex system, I’ve summarized my experience and will talk about my design methods.</p>
<h2 id="1-Analyze-the-Goal"><a href="#1-Analyze-the-Goal" class="headerlink" title="1. Analyze the Goal"></a>1. Analyze the Goal</h2><p>The goal is still the starting point of the design. It is necessary to clarify the direction before designing. For example, for a game system, the first step is to clarify what the system does and what its core functions are, and to clarify my iteration goals. Secondly, as an interaction designer, I analyze the characteristics of the core users and the user’s behavior path in this system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>Setting design goals is a very important part. The more detailed the goals, the more basis there will be for the subsequent design process.</p>
<h2 id="2-Hierarchy"><a href="#2-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="2. Hierarchy"></a>2. Hierarchy</h2><p>Multiple interfaces mean that the hierarchical relationship between interfaces needs to be sorted out, which is often referred to as information architecture. Sorting out the information architecture seems to be a basic skill, but it is often difficult to do it well.</p>
<p>Under the time constraints of development, it is often required to quickly and accurately sort out the hierarchical relationship. Here, I often use the method of organizing similar functions to sort out the hierarchy.</p>
<p>At the same time, sort out the relationship between the “layer” and “degree” of the information architecture. Addition and subtraction can be used to change the hierarchical relationship of functions, and ensure that information is not lost.</p>
<h2 id="3-Interface-Design"><a href="#3-Interface-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. Interface Design"></a>3. Interface Design</h2><p>The single interface design mentioned here refers to the information layout design in a single interface. After sorting out the hierarchical relationship, the remaining is the design of how to display information in a single interface.</p>
<p>There are many design forms in a single interface, and various layouts have their own advantages and disadvantages. Designers need to choose the most suitable layout. The core point is to figure out the information weight of the current interface. The following are several common information layout forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organizational information:</strong> Commonly used in skill talent trees, leaderboards, etc., emphasizing the relationship and order between information.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F6fb89720-0d3c-4565-a42d-d01625ce0aa1.jpg/size/" alt="Organizational Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spatial information:</strong> Commonly used in navigation, maps, etc., emphasizing the dimensional hierarchy of information.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F8503964f-2a1c-49bc-b425-8a46b756e67b.jpg/size/" alt="Spatial Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetrical information:</strong> Commonly used in matching, confrontation, etc., emphasizing the corresponding relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2Fb8c8f973-fc3f-4d2e-a05f-0d74d97335a7.jpg/size/" alt="Symmetrical Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>List information:</strong> Commonly used in stores and other situations, emphasizing the subordinate relationship and the relationship of parallel systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F4e8412e1-044f-4924-8fa5-848deb0de84a.jpg/size/" alt="List Information Example"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other types of interfaces, which will not be repeated here.</p>
<h2 id="4-Integrate-with-the-Game-Worldview"><a href="#4-Integrate-with-the-Game-Worldview" class="headerlink" title="4. Integrate with the Game Worldview"></a>4. Integrate with the Game Worldview</h2><p>After satisfying the functions, I will evaluate which interfaces focus on function and which interfaces focus on presentation. Integrating with the worldview is a test of the designer’s creativity. Often, referring to real-world affairs will be of great help to the design. Experience the world outside the game, collect interesting creative materials, and try to transform them into UI.</p>
