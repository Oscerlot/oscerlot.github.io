<p>Gamification is a concept that has gradually gained attention in recent years. Some mini-games have also appeared in many Internet products, such as Alibaba’s Ant series, Taobao’s mini-games, and so on.</p>
<p>But whether it is in the gaming industry or Non-Gaming industries, many people often have some questions, what is gamification? Is adding mini-games to non-game products gamification?</p>
<h2 id="The-Concept-of-Gamification"><a href="#The-Concept-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="The Concept of Gamification"></a>The Concept of Gamification</h2><p>First, what is a game?</p>
<p>Everyone has their own understanding of this question. In academia, some scholars have proposed a short and precise definition of the game: a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>Traditional games are mainly used for entertainment purposes. They generate fun by setting up some obstacles and having users solve them, achieving the purpose of entertainment.</p>
<p>The concept of gamification is no longer limited to traditional games themselves, but can be combined with other non-game factors, and game concepts can be used without restrictions.</p>
<p>Gamification, also known as Gamification, was proposed by Deterding in 2011. One early, and widely accepted definition, of Gamification is:</p>
<p>Gamification refers to the use of game elements in non-game systems to enhance user experience and engagement.</p>
<p>In practical applications, gamification can take two forms: it can either adopt some game elements in a non-game system, or it can be a complete game with a certain non-game purpose.</p>
<h2 id="Gamification-Elements"><a href="#Gamification-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Elements"></a>Gamification Elements</h2><p>Simply adding a mini-game does not constitute real gamification. Gamification uses game thinking and design elements to solve problems and motivate users.</p>
<p>Game elements include game design principles, methods, game frameworks, game mechanics, specific interface designs, and so on.</p>
<p>The flexible use and integration of these elements into non-game systems is the gamification method.</p>
<p>For example, the father of Pokémon, the famous Japanese game producer and president of Game Freak, Satoshi Tajiri (たじりさとし), proposed a concept in 1996 when “Pokémon Red” and “Pokémon Green” became popular all over the world - the fun of the game has four major elements: collection, cultivation, interaction, and exploration.</p>
<p>These elements can greatly stimulate users’ interest and desire to participate. Integrating these elements into the design of non-game systems can also greatly improve user engagement. While users are performing game behaviors, certain information is subtly implanted and user behavior is shaped.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Gamification"><a href="#Application-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="Application of Gamification"></a>Application of Gamification</h2><p>In recent years, gamification has been gradually applied in many fields such as education, business, information research, human-computer interaction, and health.</p>
<p>There are many examples of gamification in the field of education. Game elements can enhance the fun of learning and increase people’s initiative to complete learning tasks, and can also increase student participation and enhance communication between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of gamification in early childhood education is particularly prominent. Because children themselves have characteristics such as difficulty concentrating and being easily attracted by fun elements, the combination of gamification and teaching can significantly improve teaching effects.</p>
<p>Some teachers use gamification concepts when designing classroom processes, such as setting course rewards, combining game links, and so on.</p>
<p>In the business field, some studies explore the application of gamification management in enterprise management.</p>
<p>Gamification management evokes achievement motivation, improves participation and initiative, and creates a win-win situation for enterprises and employees from three aspects: incentive, interaction, and fairness. Some game mechanisms such as points, badges, and levels are introduced as reputation and incentive mechanisms for employees. Some successful entrepreneurs also use gamification as the core highlight of their products to provide services, such as Codecademy, which uses gamification to teach users programming.</p>
<p>And, in the field of health initiatives, gamification has also been applied.</p>
<p>Gamification can make people more involved in and responsible for health-related decisions, and can also improve the performance of healthcare professionals. It is specifically applied in sports, nutrition, weight control, medication compliance, and personal hygiene.</p>
<p>Some children’s hospitals have also adopted the concept of gamification in the design of the entire medical treatment process, such as providing some games that combine medical knowledge in the dentist’s waiting room, assigning tasks to children to complete medical treatment, and receiving rewards. Some necessary medical knowledge is popularized through some gamified forms, and children’s tension and anxiety are also relieved.</p>
<p>With the development of industry technology and emerging concepts, games have gradually transcended the limitations of traditional games and are used in all walks of life. We game practitioners can find many gamified applications outside of games and in life, which is also a reflection and inspiration for game design concepts and elements.</p>
