<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous article, “Consumer Psychology and Games: A Few Thoughts,” mainly introduced some concepts, origins, and development of consumer psychology. This article shares some research on consumer psychology and games.</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-Psychology-and-Games"><a href="#Consumer-Psychology-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="Consumer Psychology and Games"></a>Consumer Psychology and Games</h2><p>In fact, foreign researchers have conducted a lot of research on games and consumer psychology, which to some extent proves that the popularity of games has also promoted the development of the game industry. However, there is relatively less research in China, which may provide less reference for the domestic game industry.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the consumption of games is indeed very similar to some of our traditional consumption, but there are also some differences. The first is that game products are all virtual, just a string of code, but they do have value. The “Unrestricted” weapons in <em>Fantasy Westward Journey (梦幻西游)</em> are the best example.</p>
<p>Second, game consumption can improve character attributes, which not only satisfies the needs of the character, but also is an extension of the consumer’s self. This has never appeared in traditional consumption.</p>
<h2 id="Consumption-Motivation"><a href="#Consumption-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Consumption Motivation"></a>Consumption Motivation</h2><p>Let’s go back to the very first question.</p>
<p><em>Why aren’t your players buying your costumes and appearances anymore?</em></p>
<p>This involves the consumption motivation in the game.</p>
<p>The consumption motivation for appearances in games is obviously driven by the purchasing motivation that primarily pursues aesthetics.</p>
<p>Game players often pursue the aesthetic experience of the game item’s shape, color, style, and special effects. Costume items, mount items, pet items, weapon items, etc., can all stimulate the consumption behavior of game players through the pursuit of beauty.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the most important motivation - aesthetics - low price is another consumption motivation for appearance items.</p>
<p>After all, whether in the real world or the virtual world, good quality and low price are the eternal pursuit of consumers. If the game has discount promotions for a period of time, the revenue during this period is often higher than other periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190905%2Ff51d2aec-dcb7-44f2-a573-3941f9b0e34e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190905&#x2F;f51d2aec-dcb7-44f2-a573-3941f9b0e34e.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Justice Online’s (逆水寒)</em> newly released [Lu Ran Fu Qu (露染芙蕖)] was sold at a 40% discount in the first two weeks. Instead of 688 or 520, it only cost 100+. With a novel design and full details, it can be regarded as a model work that grasps the consumer’s aesthetics and low-price motivation, and it must have sold a lot.</p>
<p>So the answer to the previous question is, either you made it too ugly, or you priced it too high. As for how to design and price, there is a lot of room for creativity.</p>
<h2 id="Influencing-Factors-of-Consumption-Behavior"><a href="#Influencing-Factors-of-Consumption-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Influencing Factors of Consumption Behavior"></a>Influencing Factors of Consumption Behavior</h2><p><em>Why did I spend so much money on the game this month?</em></p>
<p>So the question is, why did you spend so much? First, we need to consider basic demographic information, such as age.</p>
<p>Chen (2010) previously stated that younger players still have stronger gaming intentions and more gaming behaviors than adult players. But it’s understandable that young people have strong intentions, but they still can’t beat the big spenders.</p>
<p>Although young people can invest more time and energy, the money they spend in the game is still relatively small (Qiu Junzheng, 2010).</p>
<p>Another example is gender. Generally speaking, men prefer online games, and they will invest more time, energy, and money in online games (Chen, 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190905%2Fc0cdb1fd-9ce8-4c25-b2cd-286a73230894.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190905&#x2F;c0cdb1fd-9ce8-4c25-b2cd-286a73230894.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition to the players, the characteristics of the game itself are also important influencing factors.</p>
<p>For example, from the most expressive game screen performance, the research of Luo Shaokang, Wang Zhijian, and Fang Wenchang (2005) shows that the graphics are the key factor affecting the player’s first game behavior, but players have significant differences in their evaluation of the graphics quality of the same type of game.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not difficult to understand. It’s like asking a purely three-dimensional person to play a game with a two-dimensional art style, their evaluation may be very low, but it’s completely different for happy two-dimensional otakus.</p>
<p>Finally, social interaction is also a very important aspect, especially for MMORPGs. Social activities, social capital, social norms, etc. can actually be reflected in the game.</p>
<p>In traditional consumption, although there is a certain degree of social interaction between customers, its breadth and depth cannot be compared with the social interaction in online games. In the game, guilds or gangs are a very critical part of an MMORPG, and players who have played such games must have a deep understanding of this. Battles between different guilds, or comparisons between friends in the same guild, are important factors affecting customer consumption.</p>
<h2 id="The-Last-Question"><a href="#The-Last-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Last Question"></a>The Last Question</h2><p>So there is one last question from the previous article that remains to be solved.</p>
<p><em>It’s the game’s anniversary, what gift should I buy for my in-game significant other?</em></p>
<p>Wake up, you don’t have an in-game significant other!</p>
