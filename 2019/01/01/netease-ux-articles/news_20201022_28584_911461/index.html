<h2 id="The-Beginning-of-Motion-Sensing-Games"><a href="#The-Beginning-of-Motion-Sensing-Games" class="headerlink" title="The Beginning of Motion-Sensing Games"></a>The Beginning of Motion-Sensing Games</h2><p>Motion-sensing games are not a new thing. As early as the beginning of video games, arcade games were the biggest promoters of motion-sensing games. Experiencing games with your body, the meaning of motion-sensing games is as literal as it sounds.</p>
<p>If you were to ask what the first well-known motion-sensing game was, Nintendo’s “Duck Hunt” on the NES sold 30 million copies. In that era of scarce game performance, without exquisite graphics and a vivid virtual world, motion-sensing elements could be said to be the most obvious way to enhance the gaming experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Ffd8874c3-7f76-4475-871b-3f31a8443511.jpg/size/" alt="fd8874c3-7f76-4475-871b-3f31a8443511.jpg"></p>
<p>Motion-sensing games rely heavily on specialized, unique input devices. This requires players who want to experience motion-sensing games to purchase expensive equipment to play, and these devices cannot support other games. From the very beginning of motion-sensing games, its advantages and disadvantages have been exposed. People cannot play motion-sensing games for a long time, nor can they play them lying in bed. The interaction form of motion-sensing games brings fun to players, but also brings experience problems: inaccurate recognition, discomfort caused by physical exertion, and space limitations.</p>
<p>The history of motion-sensing games is a game of trade-offs, how to make the interactive experience more interesting, and also make the input hardware more versatile. Or rather, the key problem that motion-sensing games need to solve is to find the best input device for controlling body movements. Personal computers require a mouse and keyboard, TV consoles cannot do without gamepads, and mobile phone interaction is based on touch screens. So what should the interactive device for motion-sensing games be?</p>
<h2 id="Expectation-and-Disappointment"><a href="#Expectation-and-Disappointment" class="headerlink" title="Expectation and Disappointment"></a>Expectation and Disappointment</h2><p>Then, time came to 2006, and Nintendo, which once used a laser gun to hunt ducks, came with its “big baby” again. Nintendo’s internal code name was “The Revolution”, and the TV console Wii, based on the concept of motion sensing and home entertainment mode, was released, with sales of 20 million units in the first year. As of December 2018, the cumulative global sales of Wii reached 101.63 million units, and 920.66 million copies of games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F2fc96b70-2e6e-4f72-b183-d69e4cfbf355.jpg/size/" alt="2fc96b70-2e6e-4f72-b183-d69e4cfbf355.jpg"></p>
<p>This console was conceived after the launch of GAMECUBE in 2001.</p>
<p>Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview that the plan at the time focused on a new way of interaction between the game console and the player.</p>
<p>The consensus at the time was that hardware capabilities were not the entirety of a game console. The market cannot allow too many high-performance consoles to coexist at the same time. Just like if there were only ferocious carnivorous dinosaurs on the earth, they might kill each other, eventually leading to their own extinction.”</p>
<p>Wii was very successful in that era, and it was from Wii that motion-sensing games entered a climax. Microsoft and Sony have successively launched their own motion-sensing kits. It seems that consoles without motion-sensing functions cannot be called good consoles. But each company also has its own views on how motion sensing should be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="Is-the-Motion-Controller-the-Future"><a href="#Is-the-Motion-Controller-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Is the Motion Controller the Future?"></a>Is the Motion Controller the Future?</h2><p>The motion-sensing interaction mode proposed by Nintendo relies on its motion-sensing controller. This is also a major interactive mode of motion sensing in the following ten years. The main difference of the motion-sensing controller lies in the use of gravity sensing and accelerometer sensors, so that the controller can sense the player’s waving action, as well as the approximate position and movement direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F1ac1aea0-ef7d-4765-afa4-b2aba81fa872.jpg/size/" alt="1ac1aea0-ef7d-4765-afa4-b2aba81fa872.jpg"></p>
<p>The advantage of the motion controller is that it is less affected by the environment. As long as the player holds it in his hand, he can operate freely. Secondly, with different device extensions, the shape and holding posture can be switched according to different game types, simulating the player’s physical touch in the game to a greater extent. But its disadvantages are also obvious. It cannot capture the player’s complete motion information. For example, in the “Just Dance” game, although the game requires corresponding actions to score, many times you can get a high score as long as you wave the controller according to the rhythm. At the same time, the gamepad also limits the number of operation inputs. In the simulated driving game, players can only control the direction, and the speed control can only be controlled by the computer. This greatly affects the original gameplay of the game. Because of this, there has never been a truly hardcore work in motion-sensing games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F03b4071a-a64d-4f6a-accb-df3de8310a0f.jpg/size/" alt="03b4071a-a64d-4f6a-accb-df3de8310a0f.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Motion-Capture-and-Gesture-Interaction"><a href="#Motion-Capture-and-Gesture-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Motion Capture and Gesture Interaction"></a>Motion Capture and Gesture Interaction</h2><p>In 2010, in order to catch up with the sales of Nintendo’s Wii console, Microsoft finally brought their motion-sensing device-Kinect. Kinect adopts a completely different interactive approach. It does not rely on any physical devices. Players only need to stand in front of the camera to capture the player’s complete body movements. Even on Kinect 2.0, the accuracy and effect of this capture are very good. In addition to motion capture, Kinect’s dot-matrix microphone also supports voice control. The high-tech Kinect created a world record for sales at the time, and even now it still is.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F07e92e64-5eee-4c7b-a92a-0a534f665a91.jpg/size/" alt="07e92e64-5eee-4c7b-a92a-0a534f665a91.jpg"></p>
<p>On Kinect, players control the cursor by the position of their hands, and holding is a click operation. They can also wave to do page turning and return operations. Gesture operation has always been considered a very cool interactive method by players, but many interactive studies show that the learning cost of gesture interaction is very high, and everyone’s understanding of gestures lacks basic consensus and habits. Secondly, gesture interaction itself cannot be precise, and it will also bring fatigue to players.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F0cd2cb55-a82d-4b98-8b3d-eaae99050b2d.jpg/size/" alt="0cd2cb55-a82d-4b98-8b3d-eaae99050b2d.jpg"></p>
<p>In the end, there were only a handful of successful games on Kinect. The relatively complete “Star Wars” can be said to be a work that was more recognized and accepted by players in terms of motion-sensing game operation at that time, and the game was no longer just a casual game. When the characters in the game make corresponding actions according to the player’s gestures, the player’s “scream level” is still very high.</p>
<p>The biggest difference from the Wii motion controller is that players can use their hands and feet together in the game and make more coherent and complex actions, such as kicking and jumping in fighting games. When designing these interactive actions, Microsoft also tried to minimize the physical exertion of players. For example, when controlling the character to move left and right, players do not need to actually make these actions, just slightly shifting their body can trigger it.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F088086ce-66aa-4196-a05b-c47bd7343e57.jpg/size/" alt="088086ce-66aa-4196-a05b-c47bd7343e57.jpg"></p>
<p>However, the biggest problem with motion interaction is also revealed, misoperation. This is also another drawback of gesture interaction. Users are no longer just operating in a single dimension, but in three-dimensional space, which makes the trigger conditions of actions themselves difficult to define and control. For example, now there is an operation called waving your arm. It seems like a simple command, but the actions that everyone may make are different; the distance, amplitude, and direction of the wave are uncontrollable. This makes the trigger conditions for gesture interaction very difficult to define, and the probability of misoperation and operation failure is very high.</p>
<h2 id="Players’-Coolness"><a href="#Players’-Coolness" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Coolness"></a>Players’ Coolness</h2><p>Therefore, after experiencing the wave of motion-sensing games in 2010, the still immature motion-sensing interaction gradually faded out of the vision of the console platform. The lack of motion-sensing game content, insufficient hardware capabilities, and the difficulty of sustaining interactive methods. When players have a taste, they are more disappointed.</p>
<h2 id="New-Exploration"><a href="#New-Exploration" class="headerlink" title="New Exploration"></a>New Exploration</h2><p>Of course, motion-sensing games were not abandoned after failure. On the contrary, it has always been the direction of future games. In the process of the gradual development of VR and AR, motion-sensing interaction has become a part of virtual reality technology, and even the only feasible form of interaction. On mobile games, motion-sensing technology will also be used as an auxiliary operation method, such as the “gravity-sensing aiming method” in <em>PUBG Mobile</em>. But motion-sensing games, as an independent and complete game system, are rarely mentioned again, until Nintendo brings its “big baby” again.</p>
<h3 id="Nintendo-Labo"><a href="#Nintendo-Labo" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Labo"></a>Nintendo Labo</h3><p>Nintendo has never given up on the exploration of motion-sensing games from beginning to end. At the beginning of the design of the new generation of mobile handheld Switch, the controller was designed as a motion-sensing controller, and an IR infrared camera was added. Although I don’t know the purpose of adding the infrared camera, in the later design of Labo, this camera can be said to provide new ideas for the entire motion-sensing game interaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Fb172612d-8487-4b5d-bd4e-453e15a2973e.jpg/size/" alt="b172612d-8487-4b5d-bd4e-453e15a2973e.jpg"></p>
<p>The Labo project is Nintendo’s another exploration of motion-sensing games. Although in the first version of Labo, the switch becomes a toy like a fishing rod, piano, etc., it seems that it cannot well reflect the concept of “motion-sensing games” (still lacking the necessary gameplay), but its working principle and design ideas have provided an interactive prototype for future series of products.</p>
<h3 id="Separate-Controllers-Work-Simultaneously"><a href="#Separate-Controllers-Work-Simultaneously" class="headerlink" title="Separate Controllers Work Simultaneously"></a>Separate Controllers Work Simultaneously</h3><p>The Switch has two independent game controllers. This design is to make it easier for you to operate with friends in multiplayer games. At the beginning of the design of Labo, the producer always hoped to make a breakthrough in operation, so that this set of interactions can give full play to the advantages of the Switch controller, instead of making settings similar to others.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have been thinking about the controller and its special features, and finally I realized that it is the sensor-there are sensors in both the left and right controllers. If we create while connecting two Joy-Cons at the same time, we can use the differences between their sensors to do various new things… This is the real beginning. ——Mr. Sakaguchi (Head of Labo Software)</p>
<p>This design concept runs through the entire Labo product, and also provides new possibilities for the design of motion-sensing devices. Usually, what people understand most easily is that two controllers are used separately, such as my right hand holding a “sword” and my left hand holding a “shield”, then they are a superimposed control relationship. But in the design of the “fishing rod”, by fixing the right Joy-Con to the handle of the fishing rod, and then fixing the left Joy-Con to the fishing reel, you can use the position of the handle to measure the rotation of the fishing reel. Or to put it another way, if you only use the Joy-Con on the left, you will not be able to distinguish the movement of the fishing rod from the movement of the fishing reel. However, if you then add the Joy-Con on the right and compare its sensor with the difference of the Joy-Con on the left, you can make it work normally. As they delved deeper into all the experiments, the Labo production team began to regard Joy-Con as a sensor bundle, which gave them a real opportunity to release the consideration of various possibilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F2bc906db-f384-4abd-897f-df7ab2b93583.jpg/size/" alt="2bc906db-f384-4abd-897f-df7ab2b93583.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Infrared-Camera-in-a-Cardboard-Box"><a href="#Infrared-Camera-in-a-Cardboard-Box" class="headerlink" title="Infrared Camera in a Cardboard Box"></a>Infrared Camera in a Cardboard Box</h3><p>In addition to the collaborative work of the controller bundle, another interesting mechanism is the use of an infrared camera. In traditional motion-sensing games, infrared depth sensors are placed in space to capture the player’s movements. In the Labo project, this infrared camera is used in a closed box. The infrared camera no longer directly captures the player’s motion information, but captures the position and size changes of the “reflective strip” in the box due to the player’s operation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Fca37f170-4d34-44b6-b491-e30a9c83c1b0.jpg/size/" alt="ca37f170-4d34-44b6-b491-e30a9c83c1b0.jpg"></p>
<p>The picture above shows the design of the control device of the Labo No. 2 project robot. Players only need to insert the controller with the infrared camera into the hole in the box, and the camera will capture the position changes of the four reflective strips in the box in the game. And the player ties the four ropes linked to the reflective strip to the feet and hands, and can control the movement of the robot in the game by pulling the rope during exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F9c2b9bff-0b9b-48e2-aabd-498af9367004.jpg/size/" alt="9c2b9bff-0b9b-48e2-aabd-498af9367004.jpg"></p>
<p>This design brings many benefits. First, the amount of input information has increased, and it is no longer limited by hardware. The camera can collect multiple different position variables at the same time, and each variable corresponds to the player’s different gesture operations. Second, gesture input information becomes controllable; as mentioned above, the problem with interactions like Kinect that rely on motion capture is that players can make many unpredictable gestures, which can lead to misoperation and operation failure; while the movement of the “reflective strip” in the box is very fixed and controllable, they can correspond very well to the fixed actions in the game, and are accurate enough. For example, in this robot game, there are only a few attack actions. Capturing the player’s extra actions (such as twisting the waist) will only increase the complexity of the trigger of the motion interaction. Converting the player’s effective actions into predictable input parameters and inputting them into the game control is the core highlight of Labo’s motion-sensing design.</p>
<p>Of course, the use of this camera also brings another benefit, which is to reduce electronification. In addition to the original Joy-con controller, the Labo controller no longer has other electronic sensors, which solves the cost problem well. This problem may be a难题 that has existed since the beginning of motion-sensing games, high cost and low versatility.</p>
<h3 id="Labo-Series-and-Ring-Fit-Adventure"><a href="#Labo-Series-and-Ring-Fit-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Labo Series and Ring Fit Adventure"></a>Labo Series and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></h3><p>The Labo series launched the third game of the series in the first half of this year. The biggest difference between the third part and the previous ones is that it is no longer a series of mini-games. This time it is a complete exploration game, and even added online and battle parts. At the same time, Labo’s motion-sensing design concept is also constantly exerting its advantages. The controller is like the key switch of the device, and players can quickly and freely switch between various motion-sensing devices; motion-sensing operations are no longer vague and inefficient, and players can very accurately control complex motion-sensing devices, and experience the fun of control at the same time.</p>

<p>Not only that, the recently released “<em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>“ has once again made motion-sensing games a big hit. The biggest change of “<em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>“ compared with traditional fitness games is the leap in its gameplay. Secondly, the interaction mode based on the fitness ring is also very interesting.</p>
<p>It seems that the second spring of motion-sensing games is coming.</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue"><a href="#Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2><p>Nintendo has always been a game company that I admire very much. When motion-sensing games are not favored by the market, they still insist on constantly trying motion-sensing creative elements in their own games. From Nintendo games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Mario Party</em>, we can experience those wonderful experiences that have disappeared. Of course, until now we dare not say whether motion-sensing games can really try to impact hardcore games, but it must be able to become the interactive mode of future immersive games. At the same time, we have also seen a clearer direction from the development of motion-sensing technology.</p>
<p>Motion-sensing games do not necessarily have to completely simulate human movement. Players can interact with the game through motion-sensing devices to complete more exciting operations. This is the goal of motion sensing. In addition, motion-sensing devices also need to have stronger scalability and be able to freely adapt to input information in different operating modes. Just like the hardware product structure designed by engineers in the past, the motion-sensing device is the “button” that guides the player to make interactive actions. In future motion-sensing games, whether this device is virtual or concrete, it will carry a more real and rich experience for players.</p>
<p>A new beginning for motion-sensing games, a new world.</p>
