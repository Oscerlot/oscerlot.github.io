<p>KANO is a method commonly used in the early stages of product development. I feel it is still worth taking some time to understand. Today, I will briefly introduce this method.</p>
<h2 id="Background-of-KANO"><a href="#Background-of-KANO" class="headerlink" title="Background of KANO"></a>Background of KANO</h2><p>Inspired by the two-factor theory of behavioral scientist Herzberg, Professor Noriaki Kano of the Tokyo University of Science, and his colleagues, first introduced the criteria of satisfaction and dissatisfaction into the field of quality management in the 1970s. They used a two-dimensional model to understand quality and proposed the famous Kano model. It is a tool for classifying and prioritizing user needs, based on analyzing the impact of user needs on user satisfaction, reflecting the non-linear relationship between product performance and user satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="Supplementary-Knowledge-Card-Two-Factor-Theory"><a href="#Supplementary-Knowledge-Card-Two-Factor-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Supplementary Knowledge Card: Two-Factor Theory"></a>Supplementary Knowledge Card: Two-Factor Theory</h3><p>Also known as the motivation-hygiene theory, it was proposed by American psychologist Herzberg in 1959. It mainly divides enterprises into two key factors, namely: motivating factors and hygiene factors. Motivating factors are factors that can make people feel satisfied and motivated (achievement, appreciation, challenge, responsibility…), and hygiene factors are factors that are prone to opinions and negative behaviors (salary, working conditions, company policies, management…).</p>
<h2 id="When-is-KANO-Suitable-for-Game-User-Research"><a href="#When-is-KANO-Suitable-for-Game-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="When is KANO Suitable for Game User Research?"></a>When is KANO Suitable for Game User Research?</h2><p>The product development cycle can be simply divided into these 5 periods. After the concept is confirmed and before the core gameplay MVP is completed, the product will go through a period of exploration. During this period, the product will sort out the main functions of the game and design the highlights and features of the game. At this time, some products will have a question: What do my users really want? Which functions&#x2F;features are more appealing to them?</p>
<p>When the product meets the first two conditions, the KANO requirement analysis can be used to help them solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>The product has a relatively clear target user (who I want to research).</li>
<li>The product has a preliminary design direction, brainstorming many special features or basic functional systems (what kind of game I want to make).</li>
<li>The product is a bit distant from their target users (non-essential condition: I don’t quite know what my users want).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two are actually easy to understand. Why do I mention the third? Because the main design team of some products is deeply rooted in the soil of their target users, and the information they know can represent the views of most of their users.</p>
<p>At this time, this kind of conceptual function research is not so significant for product reference. It is more necessary to focus on understanding the implementation standards of this feature, that is, how to express it and how it will better resonate with users. This is more common in some art material research, or combat method research.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction-to-the-KANO-Model"><a href="#Introduction-to-the-KANO-Model" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to the KANO Model"></a>Introduction to the KANO Model</h2><p>KANO divides needs into 5 types through the user’s attitude towards two situations – “having this function” and “not having this function”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attractive Needs:</strong> Needs that surprise users. If this need is not provided, it will not reduce user satisfaction. Once the attractive need is provided, user satisfaction will increase significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Needs (One-Dimensional Needs):</strong> If this function is provided, customer satisfaction increases. If this function is not provided, customer satisfaction will decrease.</li>
<li><strong>Must-be Needs (Basic Needs):</strong> These are the basic requirements of the product. If this need is not met, user satisfaction will decrease significantly. However, no matter how much the must-be needs are improved, customer satisfaction will have an upper limit.</li>
<li><strong>Indifferent Needs:</strong> Whether this function is provided or not, user satisfaction will not change. Users do not care whether this function exists or not. This kind of thankless need should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Needs:</strong> Users do not have this need at all. After providing it, user satisfaction will decrease. Improvement can greatly reduce dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>One important function of KANO is to help products prioritize players’ needs:</p>
<p>KANO’s ranking of requirements: Must-be &gt; Expected &gt; Attractive &gt; Indifferent</p>
<p>Games are not a very functional product. Users are unlikely to choose you because your basic functions are good, “for example, your game is particularly smooth”. They are more likely to choose you because of some differentiated features. In this case, letting the product know which content can be differentiated will be particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="Use-of-the-KANO-Questionnaire"><a href="#Use-of-the-KANO-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Use of the KANO Questionnaire"></a>Use of the KANO Questionnaire</h2><p>The original KANO questionnaire is mainly divided into two parts, requiring players to express their attitude from “very positive - neutral - very negative”.</p>
<p>KANO’s intention is to summarize the significance of the need for a single user by classifying the user’s attitude.</p>
<p>Note: The initial score is that one sample has a need classification for one function.</p>
<p>(A-Attractive needs, O-Expected needs, M-Must-be needs, Q-Questionable, R-Reverse needs, I-Indifferent needs)</p>
<p>The corresponding attractive, expected, must-be, reverse, and indifferent here are those that appeared in the previous quadrant diagram, so I won’t repeat them. What you need to pay attention to is your Q. If a need appears as Q, it is likely that there is a problem with this sample data, it may be an input error, or it may be a random fill-in. You need to consider deleting all the results of the sample. If there are many Qs, you should carefully review the question stem to see if there is an error in your question stem.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone will find that the results obtained by using KANO are based on the summary of the attitude of a single sample. Because each sample may have a different attitude towards the same function, coefficients&#x2F;algorithms need to be introduced for comprehensive evaluation.</p>
<p>In the Better and Worse system, R and Q are not included, so reverse needs need to be counted separately.</p>
<p>PS: When a need is rated as a reverse need a lot, this need needs to be excluded.</p>
<p>PPS: Under normal circumstances, reverse needs in games rarely appear. If they do appear, you need to pay attention to whether there is a problem with the description of the need.</p>
<p>Through score conversion, you will finally get a scatter plot.</p>
<p>No matter which method you use, you will eventually get a scatter plot. The KANO model does not give a fixed quadrant division standard. You need to set a dividing line to help you classify needs. This indicator line is the horizontal and vertical axes of the quadrant diagram.</p>
<p>Here are two division methods that I have used or seen:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Divide according to the distribution of current demand scores</strong></p>
<p>This method has a stronger directivity for the ranking of needs (internal relative value); the directivity for the category attribution of need classification will be weaker.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Divide according to the meaning of the attitude represented by the score</strong></p>
<p>① 0.5 Better&#x2F;Worse coefficient – at least 50% of people think it would be better to have this&#x2F;would be disappointed not to have this</p>
<p>② Average attitude score of 2 points – it would be okay to have this function (hope to have it, but it won’t add points)&#x2F;reluctantly accept not having this function (hope to have it, but not having it won’t deduct points)</p>
<p>This method has a clearer attitude towards the category attribution of need classification; but it is relatively strict. In non-essential products such as game products, because players have large differences in the fun they pursue in the game, the attitude will not be very concentrated. This method is still applicable when the differences within the group are small during the research, such as all of them being the same type of players (such as strong PVP players in a strong operation MMO).</p>
<h2 id="Practical-Operation-Process-of-KANO-Questionnaire"><a href="#Practical-Operation-Process-of-KANO-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Practical Operation Process of KANO Questionnaire"></a>Practical Operation Process of KANO Questionnaire</h2><p>As a questionnaire, KANO can be used for research alone, or it can be combined with in-depth interviews or focus groups. There are various ways to use it. The questionnaire itself has roughly these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requirement pool collection &amp; item confirmation.</li>
<li>Questionnaire design (determining question items and options, and confirming the presentation format)</li>
<li>Questionnaire testing</li>
<li>Data collection (distribution + recycling)</li>
<li>Data cleaning (exclusion of invalid questionnaires)</li>
<li>Data analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several points that must be paid attention to in actual operation:</p>
<p>① As a questionnaire, the text carries most of the product’s intentions, so it is necessary to ensure that the question stem can be understood by users, and the content understood by users is consistent with the original intention of the product. It is recommended to do at least two rounds of text material testing (testing to find problems to modification is one round).</p>
<p>② The filling method of KANO is relatively complicated, and users with different abilities have different understanding abilities. It is best to administer the test in person (the tester needs to understand the original intention of the product for the description of each item in the document), which can better explain the logic of the questionnaire and provide immediate interpretation help.</p>
<p>This article ends here. Thank you for reading. I hope it can be helpful to everyone in using the KANO tool~</p>
