<p>A game community refers to an online community composed of a group of game-loving netizens who specifically discuss and interact with games and game-related content. It has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) It has a certain entry threshold;</p>
<p>(2) It has a specific space for communication and interaction;</p>
<p>(3) It produces content around specific topics.</p>
<p>For us game practitioners, the game community is a very important platform for interacting with players and conducting game marketing activities, because it allows us to better understand the preferences of players with rich game experience and high game skills for game mechanics and content. In the first<br>date: November 29, 2019), we introduced TapTap, a professional game community with a clear access mechanism, a strong interactive atmosphere among community members, and a commitment to high-quality game reviews. In this article, we will introduce another well-known game community platform - Haoyou Kuaibao (AppChina). Although it has some similarities with TapTap in terms of service content and member profiles, Haoyou Kuaibao also has its own unique positioning, which also affects the game marketing and operation strategies of game practitioners to a large extent.<br>categories:<br>    - NetEase UX<br>-## Part Two: Haoyou Kuaibao (AppChina)</p>
<p>Haoyou Kuaibao is a game enthusiast community developed by Xiamen Chunyou Interactive Technology Co., Ltd. In Haoyou Kuaibao, users can follow the real-time trends of the mobile game market through the rankings, and they can also experience beta versions of new games first and publish game reviews to communicate with millions of game enthusiasts and game developers. Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao has the following two unique service positions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focusing on the “Game Guides + Toolbox” integrated module as the main content feature:</strong> Compared with TapTap, which focuses on user social interaction and community operation, Haoyou Kuaibao is more practical - it focuses on meeting the specific needs of players to “play”. The main content feature of Haoyou Kuaibao is the integrated module of “Game Guides + Toolbox”, that is, players can not only share game guides in game reviews, but also launch self-created auxiliary tools for high-traffic games with a certain learning threshold, such as network accelerators, <em>Clash Royale</em> deck builders, <em>Arena of Valor</em> rune simulators, etc. In the main page of the Haoyou Kuaibao App, there are many entrances to game guides&#x2F;toolboxes, and they are all in a prominent position on the page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Different Toolbox&#x2F;Guide Entrances on the Haoyou Kuaibao Page</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Focusing on letting players recommend games independently:</strong> In the introduction of the previous article, we can know that TapTap values the cultivation of high-quality game review content, which requires TapTap to take the “high-end, elegant, and classy” “elite” route in user group cultivation and game review screening, that is, the reviews and guides written by players with rich game experience and high game skills are more credible and more likely to be recommended by TapTap editors, becoming an important force affecting the game experience and evaluation of other ordinary players. Different from TapTap, by setting up a distinctive player self-recommendation game list function, Haoyou Kuaibao gives more ordinary players the opportunity to independently recommend and review games. In the “Novelty - Game List” module on the App’s homepage, players can search for or create popular game lists. The games included in the list reflect more of the players’ personal preferences, rather than professionally evaluated and more popular games.</li>

<p>Why are there these significant differences between Haoyou Kuaibao and TapTap in service positioning and content features? This is related to the differences in user groups between the two. Compared with TapTap, what are the profile characteristics of Haoyou Kuaibao users? Do they have preferences for specific game categories and mechanics? By querying the Baidu Index (time window: September 29, 2019 - October 28, 2019) and referring to other industry reports, we obtained the following user profile information of Haoyou Kuaibao:</p>
<p>(1) User gender distribution: Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao users have a relatively balanced gender distribution, with slightly more males than females.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F32c12802-3b82-4b0e-bce6-1d638303d867.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;32c12802-3b82-4b0e-bce6-1d638303d867.jpg"></p>
<p>(2) User age distribution: Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao users are older on average, with the highest proportion of users aged 30-39, exceeding 50%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Ff2e55c7d-c1a7-4791-8ddd-7a3de15c37a2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;f2e55c7d-c1a7-4791-8ddd-7a3de15c37a2.jpg"></p>
<p>(3) User geographic distribution: Compared with TapTap users who are mostly distributed in coastal areas, a considerable number of Haoyou Kuaibao users are distributed in central provinces. If calculated according to the frequency of users searching for Haoyou Kuaibao in various places, Henan, Hebei and other central provinces rank prominently, surpassing coastal provinces such as Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F216564ba-47e1-47ac-b9fa-4a682d3de2ac.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;216564ba-47e1-47ac-b9fa-4a682d3de2ac.png"><br>TapTap user geographic distribution, it can be seen that its users are mostly distributed in coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F3346c700-3519-44e7-88da-7bec8053816f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;3346c700-3519-44e7-88da-7bec8053816f.png"><br>Haoyou Kuaibao user geographic distribution, it can be seen that a considerable number of users are distributed in Henan and Hebei.</p>
<p>(4) User game preference: According to the introduction of the previous article, we can conclude that TapTap users relatively prefer indie games, and they rate games with innovative gameplay higher than popular game categories. In contrast, based on the research on the shortlist of Haoyou Kuaibao’s 2018 Best Game and Most Popular Game, we found that Haoyou Kuaibao users have a higher acceptance of popular games from major manufacturers. <em>PUBG Mobile</em> even won the Most Popular Game of the Year award. At the same time, compared with TapTap users, Haoyou Kuaibao users also prefer a more diverse range of game types, covering the popular battle royale, FPS, RPG, MOBA and the relatively niche sandbox and survival genres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F034e94d2-18ea-4838-9dd1-a6e789c3cf72.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;034e94d2-18ea-4838-9dd1-a6e789c3cf72.jpg"></p>
<p>The red circles in the table indicate the games nominated for the 2018 Haoyou Kuaibao Best&#x2F;Most Popular Game by two major domestic game manufacturers - Tencent and NetEase. It can be seen that Haoyou Kuaibao users have a high acceptance of games produced by domestic major manufacturers</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Fbeb5a711-1801-470c-ae99-8b4ee2bbe399.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;beb5a711-1801-470c-ae99-8b4ee2bbe399.jpg"></p>
<p>From the nomination of Haoyou Kuaibao’s 2018 Best&#x2F;Most Popular Game, it can be seen that its users prefer a more diverse range of game categories. Compared with TapTap users, Haoyou Kuaibao users have a higher acceptance of popular game categories</p>
<p>Conclusion: From the above analysis, we draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) As a game community, Haoyou Kuaibao: Compared with TapTap, it has a lower entry threshold, a more diverse user group, and focuses on meeting players’ practical needs for “playing”.</p>
<p>(2) As a member of such a game community: They may be relatively older and have a preference for popular game categories and gameplay.</p>
