<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Is the last thing the least important? The answer is NO.</p>
<p>When writing an article, the opening and closing paragraphs are often crucial. When holding an evening party, the most important programs are often arranged at the opening and the finale. The serial position effect describes such a memory phenomenon: when listing items, the elements at the very beginning and the very end are easier to remember than those in the middle.</p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 was showcased in the finale of the 2020 NetEase Games 520 Conference</em></p>
<p><em>The finale of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony was a chorus of “Hey Jude”</em></p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Serial-Position-Effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Serial-Position-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Serial Position Effect?"></a>What is the Serial Position Effect?</h2><p>The serial position effect includes the primacy effect and the recency effect: the enhanced recall effect produced for items at the beginning position is called the primacy effect. The primacy effect occurs because the initial items on the list can be stored in long-term memory more effectively than later items; the enhanced recall effect produced for items at the end, the most recent, is called the recency effect, which is because the recent items are still in working memory and can be obtained more easily.</p>
<p><em>Human memory is divided into sensory (instantaneous memory), short-term memory, and long-term memory</em></p>
<p>The effect of the serial position effect is closely related to the speed at which items appear. When items appear quickly, the primacy effect is often less significant than the recency effect. This is because people do not have enough time to store the initial items in their memory for a long time, while the recent items are still in working memory and can be easily obtained. However, due to the timeliness of working memory, the recency effect is extremely susceptible to time and other information interference, losing its effectiveness. Therefore, when items appear slowly, the effect of the primacy effect is often more stable and free from interference. However, if the items do not appear one by one at one time, but have a longer interval between one of them, the recency effect often plays a greater role.</p>
<p>In addition, the primacy effect often makes it easier for people to form preconceived stereotypes: in five typical experiments, the adjectives ranked first had a greater impact on the overall impression. For example, the two sentences below: students who saw the first sentence had a more favorable impression of John than students who saw the second sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>John is intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn and jealous;</li>
<li>John is jealous, stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious, and intelligent;</li>
</ul>
<p>This stereotype will affect the subsequent information processing: this also reveals why an excellent opening CG and interaction, as the first impression, can play a foundational role in the player’s evaluation tone.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Serial-Position-Effect-in-Game-Interaction"><a href="#Application-of-Serial-Position-Effect-in-Game-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Application of Serial Position Effect in Game Interaction"></a>Application of Serial Position Effect in Game Interaction</h2><p>In the specific game interaction interface, the primacy and recency can be found according to the attention priority of the interface. Based on the cognitive law of the serial position effect, the game behavior of players can be subtly guided.</p>
<p>Take activity tasks as an example. Often, the first pop-up information that players come into contact with when they open the game is the current game task&#x2F;activity interface, guiding players to play the game according to the gameplay designed by the planner.</p>
<p>The task guidance during the game process utilizes the recency effect to provide players with real-time game guidance. When players don’t know what to do, it provides a quick way of thinking about the game.</p>
<p>The same applies to the content arrangement of the event page and the mall page. Often, limited-time events&#x2F;main promotion packages&#x2F;preferential packages are often placed at the beginning and end according to the attention priority. Such operations often make players choose the more time-sensitive&#x2F;more popular&#x2F;relatively more favorable package first.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the serial position effect also has a certain impact on attribution. In combat games, the performance in the late stage is often considered by players to have a more decisive effect on the final result. At the same time, because of the recency effect, the effect of the end of the game is easier to remember than the effect of the middle part of the game, which will have an important impact on the player’s experience and evaluation. Therefore, the user experience in the final part is also crucial.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The serial position effect is very common in people’s daily life and cognitive behavior, and plays a subtle role in people’s decision-making, attribution, and evaluation. Relevant scholars also pointed out that when acquaintances interact, the recency effect plays a greater role; when interacting with strangers, the primacy effect plays a greater role. Reasonably using the cognitive law of the serial position effect according to the situation will help designers create a smoother user experience and obtain higher user evaluations.</p>
