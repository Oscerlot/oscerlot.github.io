<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211209/28584_990945.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This is the Oasis, a whole virtual universe. The only limit here is your own imagination.” - <em>Ready Player One</em></p>
<p>In 2018, the movie <em>Ready Player One</em> was released. Director Steven Spielberg presented an seemingly absurd yet fascinating world to the audience: when people put on VR glasses, they can enter this virtual world that contrasts sharply with the real world - this is the new world called “Oasis”. This virtual world has bustling cities and an independent economic system. You can be anyone and do anything. Even if you are a loser struggling on the fringes of society in reality. Take a leap, and you can still become a superhero in the “Oasis”.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that three years later, the “Metaverse,” based on <em>Ready Player One</em>, would become the hottest concept in the global investment circle. 2021 is clearly the “first year of the Metaverse”: Roblox, as the “first Metaverse stock”, was grandly listed, with a market value of over 40 billion US dollars, 10 times that of a year ago. Closely followed by Epic Games, the company that produced <em>Fortnite</em>, which raised 1 billion US dollars to develop its Metaverse business. Then Facebook changed its name to “Meta” and announced that it would transform into a Metaverse company within five years. In China, MetaApp, which is quite similar to Roblox, has also completed a C round of financing of up to 100 million US dollars, known as “the largest single financing for the Metaverse in China”. In addition, Nvidia, Tencent, ByteDance… from abroad to China, various giants have announced their Metaverse strategies. The Metaverse has become a battleground.</p>
<h2 id="So-Where-Did-the-Metaverse-Come-From"><a href="#So-Where-Did-the-Metaverse-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="So Where Did the Metaverse Come From?"></a>So Where Did the Metaverse Come From?</h2><p>The Metaverse is not a new concept. In 1992, the famous American science fiction master Neal Stephenson described the Metaverse in his novel <em>Snow Crash</em>: “Put on headphones and goggles, find a connection terminal, and you can enter a virtual space simulated by a computer, parallel to the real world, in the form of a virtual avatar.”</p>
<p>In the book, Neal Stephenson describes a network world parallel to the real world, which is named “Metaverse” in the original English. It consists of two roots, Meta and Verse. Meta means “beyond” and verse means “universe”.</p>
<p>That’s right, Metaverse is the protagonist of our article today - the Metaverse.</p>
<p>People who often play games may scoff at this concept: “Virtual worlds, we have them all in our games.” Is the Metaverse a larger, more participatory MMORPG, a better-looking, more immersive VR world?</p>
<h2 id="So-is-the-Metaverse-that-Everyone-is-Talking-About-Now-Just-a-Virtual-World-in-a-Game"><a href="#So-is-the-Metaverse-that-Everyone-is-Talking-About-Now-Just-a-Virtual-World-in-a-Game" class="headerlink" title="So, is the Metaverse that Everyone is Talking About Now Just a Virtual World in a Game?"></a>So, is the Metaverse that Everyone is Talking About Now Just a Virtual World in a Game?</h2><p>Not really, or rather, not just.</p>
<p>In fact, Metaverse &#x3D; MMORPG + Open-ended Tasks + Editable World + XR Entrance + AI Content Generation + Economic System + Social System + Avatar System + Decentralized Authentication System + Real-world Elements…</p>
<p>Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki proposed that the Metaverse should at least include the following eight elements: Identity, Friends, Immersive, Low Friction, Variety, Anywhere, Economy, and Civility.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> You can have a virtual identity, regardless of your real-world identity. You can be the president or a beggar.</li>
<li><strong>Friends:</strong> You can have real or AI friends, you can socialize, whether you know them in reality or not.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive:</strong> You can be immersed in the experience of the Metaverse and ignore everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Low Friction:</strong> Everything in the Metaverse happens synchronously, without asynchrony or latency, and the experience is perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Variety:</strong> The Metaverse can provide rich and diverse content, including gameplay, props, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Anywhere:</strong> You can log in to the Metaverse anytime, anywhere, without space restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Economy:</strong> Like any complex large-scale game, the Metaverse should have its own economic system.</li>
<li><strong>Civility:</strong> People gather together to create a unique virtual civilization, a digital civilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing this to games, we will find that even the most advanced computer games today cannot fully meet the requirements of the Metaverse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity and Friends:</strong> Games can satisfy these two aspects. Players can create the characters they want, complete interactions with other players, and form social relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive, Low Latency:</strong> With current technology, it can barely be satisfied, but it is still far from the perfect experience (16K+ 720° high-definition images, 180Hz+ refresh rate, latency below 5ms).</li>
<li><strong>Variety:</strong> A large number of content creators are needed to join and produce content, to make elements in the Metaverse, including gameplay, props, characters, scenes, etc., which we call UGC (User Generated Content). At present, it is still far away.</li>
<li><strong>Anywhere:</strong> Depends on digital infrastructure and access methods. Cheap and easy-to-use access terminals can facilitate users to access the Metaverse anytime, anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Economy:</strong> Current games basically have economic systems, but they are very rudimentary. However, NFT (Non-Fungible Token) based on blockchain technology, due to its unique, non-replicable, and indivisible characteristics, can be used to record the production and transaction process of an item, thus providing a good authentication tool for property rights in the virtual world.</li>
<li><strong>Civility:</strong> Currently, games can only be said to have formed a culture, and are far from forming a civilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the Metaverse must not be a virtual world provided by a certain game. Games can at most attract many people, but it is difficult to attract most people in society. It can only become a social phenomenon, not a universe parallel to society.</p>
<h2 id="Since-the-Metaverse-is-Not-a-Game-What-is-it"><a href="#Since-the-Metaverse-is-Not-a-Game-What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Since the Metaverse is Not a Game, What is it?"></a>Since the Metaverse is Not a Game, What is it?</h2><p>Here, two practical schools holding different views of the Metaverse emerge.</p>
<p>One is the company represented by Roblox, which is committed to developing the Metaverse itself. Roblox, as the first company in the world to write the concept of the Metaverse into its IPO prospectus, is called the “first stock of the Metaverse”. This online creative game, played by more than half of the children in the United States, currently has nearly 200 million monthly active users. It allows users to use the platform’s tools to create 3D games or non-game experiences, and has the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports multiplayer online play, with a maximum of 100 people in a room, supporting social interaction.</li>
<li>The player’s image and decorations in Roblox can be used in different games on the platform and are interoperable.</li>
<li>The platform allows creators who upload games to earn the platform’s tokens, Robux.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="So-is-the-Metaverse-a-Platform-About-Games"><a href="#So-is-the-Metaverse-a-Platform-About-Games" class="headerlink" title="So is the Metaverse a Platform About Games?"></a>So is the Metaverse a Platform About Games?</h2><p>This is far from enough.</p>
<p>The Metaverse needs to attract users of all ages around the world, and also make users trust it enough, recognize that everything in it is valuable, and be willing to invest a lot of time and money in it, even work and life. It has the following three characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Able-to-Exist-Forever"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Able-to-Exist-Forever" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Able to Exist Forever"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Able to Exist Forever</h3><p>As long as civilization is not extinguished, the Metaverse will always exist. Just like the real world, users in the Metaverse can change, gameplay can change, and rules can also be adjusted, but the only thing that remains unchanged is that the world itself always exists. It is absolutely impossible for the bankruptcy of a certain company to affect the survival of the Metaverse. This is like the Internet upgrading from the internal network of American scientific research units, ARPANET, to the current Internet.</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Decentralized"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Decentralized" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Decentralized"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Decentralized</h3><p>Just as we cannot judge which country is the center of the earth, a qualified Metaverse can have hot areas, and it can also have poverty and wealth, but it must not have only one center. If the right to interpret the rules of the Metaverse world can only belong to a certain company or a certain country, this is intolerable. To achieve this, there must be an open source shared protocol for accessing the Metaverse, similar to the HTTP protocol of the Internet.</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Connected-to-Reality"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Connected-to-Reality" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Connected to Reality"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Connected to Reality</h3><p>The economic system in the Metaverse must be directly linked to the economic system of the real world. The influence generated by people’s identities in the Metaverse must be real, not illusory.</p>
<p>So let’s look at another point of view, companies led by Facebook and Microsoft that are preparing to provide services for the Metaverse in the future.</p>
<p>On October 29 this year, Zuckerberg described his vision for the Metaverse at Facebook’s Connect developer conference. Zuckerberg said: “I don’t think every company is building its own Metaverse, but all companies are building a part of the entire Metaverse, such as social platforms, tools for creators, e-commerce tools, and so on. The Metaverse is like the current Internet. No one says they are building their own Internet. We would say that we are producing experiences or infrastructure for the Internet. Here, the next generation of the Internet, this broader ecosystem, is called the Metaverse.”</p>
<p>To achieve such a Metaverse, Zuckerberg also mentioned two important characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="Interoperability"><a href="#Interoperability" class="headerlink" title="Interoperability"></a>Interoperability</h3><p>This not only requires that the user’s virtual assets and image in the Metaverse can be used in any experience, but also requires that the Metaverse and the real world have interoperability. For example, using AR to see virtual things in reality, or using VR to buy real goods in a virtual store.</p>
<h3 id="Portability"><a href="#Portability" class="headerlink" title="Portability"></a>Portability</h3><p>In addition to the computers, mobile phones, tablets, watches, etc. that we now use to access the Internet, there should also be portable VR&#x2F;AR glasses in the future, which can allow us to enter a highly immersive virtual world more quickly. The interaction operation should be more intuitive than the current sliding screen, which requires technologies such as eye movement detection and gesture operation.</p>
<p>The idea that the Metaverse is the next generation of the mobile Internet seems to make the concept of the Metaverse less unrealistic.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Exactly-is-the-Metaverse"><a href="#So-What-Exactly-is-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="So, What Exactly is the Metaverse?"></a>So, What Exactly is the Metaverse?</h2><p>The Metaverse does not yet have an authoritative definition, and different participants are constantly enriching its meaning in their own ways. Venture capitalist Matthew Ball defines the Metaverse he understands as follows:</p>
<p>“The Metaverse is a vast network of multiple real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that collaborate and interoperate with each other. This network can allow an almost unlimited number of users to experience simultaneously and continuously, and can provide independent presence and data continuity. These data include identity, history, rights, objects, communication, and payment.”</p>
<p>This definition means that the most likely form of the Metaverse should be like the changes brought about by the mobile Internet. It is not to drag us directly from reality and turn us into Internet addicts. It is more like an extension of users’ needs in communication, entertainment, consumption, production, etc. in real life.</p>
<h2 id="So-How-Far-Are-We-From-the-Metaverse-Now"><a href="#So-How-Far-Are-We-From-the-Metaverse-Now" class="headerlink" title="So, How Far Are We From the Metaverse Now?"></a>So, How Far Are We From the Metaverse Now?</h2><p>Let’s see what the giants are doing: :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is making its own 3D collaborative creation platform.</li>
<li>Omniverse wants to make an operating system for the Metaverse.</li>
<li>Epic Games raised $1 billion to support the future development of the Metaverse (of which $200 million was invested by Sony).</li>
<li>Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced that it would transform the company into a Metaverse company within five years.</li>
<li>Microsoft launched the mixed reality platform Microsoft Mesh and integrated it into its chat and conference application Microsoft Teams to build the Metaverse.</li>
<li>Sony launched <em>Dreams Universe</em>, where you can create 3D games, make videos, and share them to the UGC community.</li>
<li>Samsung developed Relumino Glass VR glasses and launched the “Artificial Human” project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="NetEase-Side"><a href="#NetEase-Side" class="headerlink" title="NetEase Side:"></a>NetEase Side:</h3><p>At the third quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2021, Ding Lei answered questions about the Metaverse layout and said: “We may be the fastest to run when the gun fires.”</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of NetEase’s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call:</p>
<p>Nomura Securities analyst Jialong Shi: A question about the concept of the Metaverse. Recently, many domestic and foreign companies, including game companies, have expressed their intention to invest in this field, so I would like to ask the management how they view the future growth opportunities brought by the Metaverse to the game industry? Can you reveal NetEase’s layout plan in the Metaverse?</p>
<p>Ding Lei: The Metaverse is indeed a very popular concept, but frankly speaking, no one has touched the Metaverse yet. One thing I can say with certainty is that NetEase is ready at all levels of technology and planning. We know how to do rule design and technology reserves, so you don’t have to worry. When the Metaverse comes, we won’t be unprepared. We may be the fastest to run when the gun fires. I can only answer this way.</p>
<p>It seems that the giants are indeed investing in or promoting the underlying technology research required by the Metaverse.</p>
<h2 id="While-We-Have-Unlimited-Expectations-and-Aspirations-for-the-Metaverse-We-Still-Need-to-Remain-Rational"><a href="#While-We-Have-Unlimited-Expectations-and-Aspirations-for-the-Metaverse-We-Still-Need-to-Remain-Rational" class="headerlink" title="While We Have Unlimited Expectations and Aspirations for the Metaverse, We Still Need to Remain Rational."></a>While We Have Unlimited Expectations and Aspirations for the Metaverse, We Still Need to Remain Rational.</h2><p>Any new technology mostly follows the Gartner Hype Cycle. The Metaverse’s development will not be done overnight.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Does-the-Metaverse-Have-to-Do-with-Me"><a href="#So-What-Does-the-Metaverse-Have-to-Do-with-Me" class="headerlink" title="So, What Does the Metaverse Have to Do with Me?"></a>So, What Does the Metaverse Have to Do with Me?</h2><p>The concept of the Metaverse seems illusory, but in fact it has gradually begun to penetrate our lives. The formation of the Metaverse will enable the coexistence of virtual life and real life, two universes, and people’s lifestyles in the Metaverse may be completely different from those in real life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture:</strong> During the epidemic last year, UCB University of California, Berkeley held a graduation ceremony in Minecraft. The scenes and elements built in the game were almost identical to those in real UCB. The character images of various graduate representatives participated in the game at the same time to hold the ceremony. To a certain extent, it has brought a unique presentation to the cause of education and culture.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, players can freely design their own islands, presenting the concept of UGC in the Metaverse. Before the US presidential election, when the epidemic was at its peak, the Biden team used the Animal Crossing platform to create Biden Island to canvass for himself. To a certain extent, it allows players to establish intersections with Mr. President in the virtual world, and connects people who may never meet in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping:</strong> <em>Boson Protocol</em>, as an infrastructure project for blockchain protocols, recently purchased a piece of land on the virtual reality platform Decentraland for $704,000, aiming to build a shopping mall for global brands on this land. It connects one end to Decentraland and the other end to various retail stores in the real world, establishing a connection between the Metaverse and the real world. In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, there are senior players in the game who have created Nookazon - the Animal Crossing version of Amazon, which is convenient for players to buy and sell items in the game. Various highly free gameplay and heavy social attributes have all promoted the development of the Metaverse ecology.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> At the end of last year, Rap singer Lil Nas X held a concert on Roblox, and this year singer Travis Scott also held a solo concert on Fortnite, attracting the online attention of 44 million users. Nas used this sentence to describe his experience: “I can have my fans running around in space, while I’m flying in a spaceship.”</li>
<li><strong>Games:</strong> As the current battleground for capital and technology, playability is the winning factor. Looking at the current game industry, some games have initially played a part of the concept of the Metaverse, just like Animal Crossing with creative content and social attributes. As for Zelda, because his game territory is quite large, it has built an open world component to a certain extent. Like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft, as professional game development teams, their playability provided by the game is also recognized by the industry, and it also provides impetus for the sustainable development of the game. There are also blockchain games Decentraland, Sandbox, Alice, etc. These games are all moving towards the decentralized infinite game - the Metaverse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Metaverse-is-an-Extension-of-User-Needs-Not-an-Escape-from-the-Real-World"><a href="#The-Metaverse-is-an-Extension-of-User-Needs-Not-an-Escape-from-the-Real-World" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse is an Extension of User Needs, Not an Escape from the Real World"></a>The Metaverse is an Extension of User Needs, Not an Escape from the Real World</h2><p>The outbreak of the new crown epidemic in the past two years has accelerated the virtualization of society, making people’s online life a normal state from a short-term exception, a parallel world from a supplement to the real world, and making people realize that the virtual is not false, let alone insignificant. 2020 has clearly become the tipping point for the virtualization of human society. In the future Metaverse, people will change a mode to work, live, and entertain. It will give birth to new 3D user-generated content, which is more attractive than short videos; there will be new ways of socializing, which are more convenient and easy to use than instant messaging software; of course, it will also create more difficult life troubles and political problems… Human real life will migrate to the virtual world on a large scale, and human beings will become amphibious species of reality and numbers. Russian President Putin believes that: “The possibilities brought by the ‘Metaverse’ should be used to break through the limitations of distance, help communication and learning, rather than an escape from the real world.”</p>
<p>The experience felt in the Metaverse, whether physical or digital - is real. In a virtual place we may be more real, we may be more comfortable or more creative than in the real world, this is the power of the parallel virtual experience. Just like the classic line in the movie <em>Ready Player One</em>:</p>
<p>“This is the Oasis, a whole virtual universe. The only limit here is your own imagination.”</p>
