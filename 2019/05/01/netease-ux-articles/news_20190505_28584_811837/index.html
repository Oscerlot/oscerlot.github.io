<p>In April, Hangzhou was already warm and blossoming, starting to move towards summer. I boarded a plane to Tokyo wearing clothes for the approaching summer. However, upon landing, I was greeted by cold rain and wind.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Ffefc9913-78e3-4daf-9084-1d5088e244d2.jpg/size/" alt="Cold Rain and Wind in Tokyo"></p>
<p>The next day, the street intercept test in Tokyo officially began. Walking out of the place where I was staying, I felt the chill of winter, a cold that even a suit jacket couldn’t block. Tokyo seemed to want to hinder our testing in this way. But would we be choked like this?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>The original plan for street intercept testing on the ordinary streets of Akihabara was changed by us, because most of the passers-by were in a hurry and were completely unwilling to stay on the road for even a second.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F0a450054-6bfb-4a0c-9936-7f7eb7256f40.jpg/size/" alt="Busy Streets of Akihabara"></p>
<p>I began to look for positions at the station that could block some of the wind, waiting for an opportunity to find pedestrians who seemed to be idle. At the same time, as opportunities became fewer, the cafes next to the station also became places I tried.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fc3eba77d-65d7-4309-bd3f-e5a5e8688b7b.jpg/size/" alt="Station and Cafe"></p>
<p>In addition, in order to increase the success rate and sample size, I asked classmates to conduct intercepts at their alma mater’s campus in Tokyo and at the entrances of stations around the campus.</p>
<p>With three approaches, the subsequent intercept tests became relatively smooth.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fc5a9a988-8a30-4849-a18d-6a57e667cd7b.jpg/size/" alt="Intercepting at University"></p>
<p>Although there were difficulties in the next two days of interceptions, we successfully overcame them and exceeded the established goals.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>When there are uncertain factors interfering with the test, different strategies should be considered, even changing the tactical direction, to ensure the completion of the established goals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To increase the effective sample size, hiring part-time students and conducting very strict training before they start intercepting is also a good compensation method.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overseas testing is very different from domestic testing. For example, Japanese people attach great importance to privacy, so when it becomes increasingly apparent that this is an issue during the testing process, it is also very important to promptly revise questions involving privacy, which can increase the probability of success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Street intercepts may encounter various types of players. Maintain a good attitude, stay calm and deal with it, and strive to complete the test goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
