</blockquote>
<p>In previous articles, we introduced many qualitative research methods. So, do you know what we spend 50% of our time doing in these qualitative studies?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, half of our time is actually spent interviewing (chatting) with players.</p>
<p>Many people may think that interviewing is actually just chatting. As long as you establish a good relationship with the player at the beginning and communicate with them in a sincere and friendly manner, the player will open up and give you all their feelings and opinions. Or maybe, it’s thought that being outgoing, cheerful, and talkative are the conditions for a successful interview.</p>
<p>But in our actual work, interviews are far from being successful based solely on creating a good atmosphere or the interviewer’s personal social skills. Everyone needs to understand that sometimes interviewees don’t express themselves much, not because they are unwilling to express themselves, but because the interviewee’s own ability to express themselves is actually limited. Sometimes, the interviewee may not even know where the problem lies. For example, we often ask players, “Why don’t you play this game anymore?” We may hope that players can make a comprehensive analysis from aspects such as graphics, gameplay, and monetization. But ask yourself, if you suddenly receive such an interview call one day, can you really figure out why you don’t want to play this game? Therefore, when we conduct interviews, we actually rely heavily on the interviewer’s own interview skills to dig out the player’s problems, help the player figure out the problems, and express them clearly.</p>
<p>The player you imagine:</p>
<p>[Image of a detailed and expressive individual]</p>
<p>The actual player, doing the Buddhist “three”:</p>
<p>[Image of a person saying “I don’t know,” “It’s okay,” and “Whatever”]</p>
<p>So how can you become an interview master?</p>
<p>[Image of a person meditating]</p>
<p>To become an interview master, we need to break through 3 levels of mastery</p>
<p><strong>The First Level of Cultivation: Be a Good Mouthpiece for Players</strong></p>
<p>Although we have always emphasized that user researchers are not just mouthpieces for players, in the initial stage of becoming an interview master, you must first learn how to be a good mouthpiece.</p>
<p>So how do you become a good mouthpiece for players? There is a keyword here, which is “disassemble” (拆 - chāi)</p>
<p>[Image of拆]</p>
<p>First of all, we need to clarify our purpose. A large part of the content of our interviews is actually to understand what problems players have encountered. The problems here, of course, refer to the problems of the product itself. So what we really need to get is feedback from players on what problems the product itself has.</p>
<p>Here, many beginner interviewers are often easily fooled by players, that is, they confuse the product’s problems with the player’s experience problems. Many times, players seem to be talking about the product’s problems, but they are actually just expressing their own feelings and not talking about the problems of the product itself.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the following question: “I feel that the… emmm… hit feedback of this game is not very good”</p>
<p>[Image showing concern and confusion at a screen]</p>
<p>What is hit feedback? In games, hit feedback refers to a kind of simulated real fighting feeling composed of attack feedback and hit feedback during the character’s fighting process. This defines whether a game’s combat feels impactful. Here, hit feedback is actually a player’s feeling.</p>
<p>[Image of hand with a lightbulb]</p>
<p>But just knowing that the hit feedback is not good, we still don’t know where the product’s problem lies. Why? Because hit feedback is actually composed of many parts. Hit feedback can first be divided into two aspects: attack process and hit performance. The attack process includes attack actions, attack special effects, hit confirmation, combo design, etc. Hit actions also include hit special effects, hit actions, etc. So the question is, the player says the hit feedback is not good. Is it because the attack action design is not real enough, or the hit action performance is not obvious? Which part should the designer modify to improve the hit feedback of this game? We cannot get the answer from the feedback of the above player.</p>
<p>[Image of a chart breaking down a character action’s components]</p>
<p>So if you encounter a player who says “the hit feedback is not good”, our interview on this issue is not over. The “depth” of in-depth interviews lies in “specificity” and “follow-up questions”</p>
<p>How to achieve “specificity”? Here we need a standard. A complete question should include these parts, 5W2H. Summarized, it can also be called a three-part answer: “problem” + “attitude” + “expectation”. The best feedback on a question should include these 3 parts. You can use this standard to check whether the player’s feedback on this issue is complete.</p>
<p>[Image of 5W2H Framework]</p>
<p>The second point, “follow-up questions”. As mentioned earlier, the player’s ability to express and their understanding of the problem are not as good as we think. Sometimes, no matter how we follow up (pressure), the player can only say that the hit feedback is not good, but they can’t say why. At this time, the interviewer needs to have the above table (framework) in mind. The interviewer can gradually locate the specific problem point with the player within this framework.</p>
<p>[Image of gears working together]</p>
<p>For example, for the problem of poor hit feedback, we can first confirm with the player whether it is some action performance of the attack process that is not obvious, or the performance of the other party being hit is not obvious. If the player says that the performance of being hit is not obvious, then we will confirm whether the hit action is not real enough, the special effects performance is not strong enough, or the sound effects are not good enough. Follow this framework to determine the location of the problem step by step. This is a common method of gradually restoring the player’s feedback attitude to the game design.</p>
<p>[Image of a funnel going from high level view, to specifics]</p>
<p>The essence of this method is to think about the player’s problems within a framework. So for a professional interview master, what is needed is a framework for disassembling various game problems. This requires us to often do some game disassembly summaries and accumulations at ordinary times. For example, when a gameplay is not fun, how can we disassemble it into the game’s design? When a game’s art is reported as not good, how can we disassemble it into various details?</p>
<p>Let’s review. Today we talked about the first level of becoming an interview master, which is to be a good mouthpiece for players</p>
<p>So how do you become a good mouthpiece for players? The keyword is “disassemble”</p>
<p>Why do we need to disassemble? Because the player’s ability to express and analyze problems is not as good as we think</p>
<p>We need to guide the player step by step to discover the location of the problem within a framework, and gradually restore the player’s feedback attitude to the game design</p>
<p>How can we accumulate these frameworks? We need to play games more often, or when we find problems, we should do more game disassembly summaries and accumulations</p>
<p>So, as I just said, there are three levels to becoming an interview master. What about the other two?</p>
<p>To be continued, so stay tuned…</p>
