<p>Last time we introduced the interview method in qualitative research. This time we will introduce the questionnaire survey in quantitative research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fb2e17500-32ee-42b5-9f3a-99c6a33863b1.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;b2e17500-32ee-42b5-9f3a-99c6a33863b1.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What is a questionnaire and what kind of information can it provide?</strong></p>
<p>A questionnaire is a common quantitative research tool in social science research. It is highly self-reported and supports the rapid collection of large-sample data. Questionnaires can provide feedback on some of the respondents’ behavioral patterns (e.g., player type&#x2F;daily game frequency), subjective feelings and attitudes (satisfaction with the game&#x2F;willingness to recommend), and the scale&#x2F;extent of feedback problems (e.g., the main problem reported by players is XXX, accounting for XX%). However, questionnaires can do little to understand the reasons behind the respondents’ behaviors and attitudes, and need to be combined with further qualitative research methods.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the questionnaire method?</strong></p>
<p>Advantages: It can quickly collect large-sample data at a lower cost, and the results can be quantitatively compared.</p>
<p>For example, by placing a game satisfaction questionnaire in the game, at least thousands of sample feedback can be collected in a short time to obtain satisfaction scores for longitudinal and horizontal comparison; while if interviews, intercepts, and other forms are used, it will consume a lot of manpower and time.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: The quality of questionnaire data will be affected by various factors such as the way of questioning, the attitude of the respondents, and the sensitivity of the questions, and the authenticity of the answers will be compromised. Moreover, the feedback content is often not deep enough, and is more biased towards phenomenon description.</p>
<p>Taking game satisfaction as an example again, the questionnaire can give us a general understanding of the satisfaction of large-sample players, but there are also the following problems: 1. Some players fill in the questionnaire sloppily and directly check the first option, without actually providing feedback on their true satisfaction. 2. We only get the players’ satisfaction scores, and do not know the reasons why high&#x2F;low-scoring players gave the scores.</p>
<p><strong>Application scenarios of questionnaire method in game user research</strong></p>
<p>Questionnaires are widely used and basically run through all stages of game research. Here are a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to understand the game type preferences of a specific group of people (such as players of a certain game&#x2F;fans of a certain IP): Distribute questionnaires in QQ groups, forums and other places where the target population gathers.</li>
<li>During the game testing period, it is necessary to introduce players with specific attributes: Use online questionnaires&#x2F;telephone questionnaires on the reservation website to collect game experience and demographic information, and then screen out the required players.</li>
<li>During the game testing period, it is necessary to understand the players’ satisfaction with the game, pain points, etc.: Distribute questionnaires in the game, and use single-choice, multiple-choice, free-form and other forms of questions to collect player feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips for questionnaire research</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Questionnaire design should be carried out around the research purpose to ensure that the data comes from the target population.</strong></p>
<p>Before designing, it is necessary to communicate the needs well and clarify the purpose of the questionnaire to ensure that the results of the questionnaire meet the research needs. This also helps to control the number of questions. In addition, the first draft of the questionnaire can be written in the form of Excel, Xmind, etc., which is convenient for quick modification and clarification of ideas, and does not need to directly produce a fillable electronic questionnaire. In addition, there are certain risks in distributing questionnaires in the name of the company, and it is necessary to check repeatedly and from multiple parties when distributing.</p>
<p><strong>2. In scenarios with a large sample size, use closed-ended questions (single-choice, multiple-choice, scale) instead of open-ended free-form questions.</strong></p>
<p>Free-form questions with large samples often mean collecting a long string of text data that is difficult to quantify uniformly and has a huge workload of coding. For the convenience of data analysis and the vertical and horizontal comparison of results, closed-ended questions should be used as much as possible. The options for closed-ended questions can be determined through runs, public opinion, feedback from previous versions, and communication with planners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa38be4fd-db98-4354-bcd4-0a928f7010d4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a38be4fd-db98-4354-bcd4-0a928f7010d4.jpg"></p>
<p>(Free-form results are often bizarre…)</p>
<p><strong>3. In terms of question design, it is necessary to make the questions easy to understand and answer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the questionnaire logically smooth and reduce the cognitive burden on players. Put questions from the same module together, or directly use matrix questions.</li>
<li>Avoid using jargon, and make questions and options easy to understand or add annotations:<ul>
<li>Counter-example: What kind of fun do you value more in the process of experiencing ARPG games? [Players may not understand what an ARPG game is, or it may be different from UE’s understanding of ARPG]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A single question should only examine one issue, and should not involve multiple contents:<ul>
<li>Counter-example: What do you think of the art style and art quality of the XXX game? [Art style and art quality are two different questions]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid leading questions: Due to the existence of acquiescence bias, players’ answers will be affected by the way of questioning.<ul>
<li>Counter-example: Is the operation of combining rough stones too cumbersome? [Player’s inner thoughts: Is it cumbersome? I didn’t pay attention, so it’s cumbersome]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pay attention to the randomization of options for some questions (completely random, ascending&#x2F;descending order) to eliminate the influence of positive statements (such as choosing the first answer)</li>
</ul>
