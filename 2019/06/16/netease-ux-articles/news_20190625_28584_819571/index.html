<p>This is a reflection on game interaction design, and I want to take this opportunity to talk about the positioning of interaction designers and their core competitiveness.</p>
<p>Everyone should be familiar with the settlement interface. Almost every game has its own settlement interface. As game interaction designers, when faced with such a mature and numerous reference interface requirements, how to make our designs stand out among many competing products has become a problem that needs to be considered. When faced with such a demand, I first chose to see how competing products do it. So I searched for relevant content on Baidu, but the results were very disappointing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fd1c04f58-8026-46d2-996c-11eb34bc9cd0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;d1c04f58-8026-46d2-996c-11eb34bc9cd0.jpg"></p>
<p>The search results are roughly as above. A closer analysis reveals that these settlement interfaces have several commonalities. The basic elements included in the interface can be summarized into the following categories: ribbons, wings, trumpets, stars, etc. These are basic GUI elements. This means that, aside from visual elements, the above settlements have little difference from an interaction perspective.</p>
<p>However, there are many beautifully designed settlements on the market. The following are excellent cases in my mind:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fb6cac392-bb85-4e8e-993e-6e32aca19749.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;b6cac392-bb85-4e8e-993e-6e32aca19749.jpg"></p>
<p>First of all, the settlement of <em>Overwatch</em> is different from the usual ideas. <em>Overwatch</em> first displays the best shots of the game before the settlement values. Even if you are the losing side, you may appear here. This design idea will weaken the performance of the battle’s win or loss, allowing players to focus more on making wonderful operations themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F5b3d75ed-dfc6-4f08-8062-43d1ed888d2b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;5b3d75ed-dfc6-4f08-8062-43d1ed888d2b.jpg"></p>
<p>Secondly, the settlement of <em>Extraordinary Ones</em> also has a new design before the numerical settlement. As a MOBA game, the relationship between winning and losing will greatly affect the player’s emotions. Therefore, as the losing side, a link of blaming teammates is designed before the numerical settlement, which cleverly transforms the original negative emotions of failure into a situation of teasing teammates, greatly reducing the unpleasant experience of failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F0b719de6-860c-490d-976b-38e0ce68ed38.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;0b719de6-860c-490d-976b-38e0ce68ed38.jpg"></p>
<p>The settlement of <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> uses the story bridges in the movie IP, combining the settlement rewards with the movie plot, which is full of situational immersion. This design will make players feel familiar with the game, and it is also more in line with the players’ psychological expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa69562ba-d29d-46f6-b67c-1b0444ab8858.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a69562ba-d29d-46f6-b67c-1b0444ab8858.jpg"></p>
<p>Then there is the settlement of <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>. Winning or losing is not what the designer wants to express most. Compared with winning or losing itself, the designer hopes that the game itself will bring fun to the players. In <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>, the performance of each player is what the designer wants to express more, so it will highlight the display of data such as MVP, most kills, and most siege damage.</p>
<p>Try to analyze what role interaction designers might play in these excellent cases, or what we as interaction designers can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa03be5cf-f23e-4ed5-b5aa-d75941baf172.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a03be5cf-f23e-4ed5-b5aa-d75941baf172.jpg"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to find that in these excellent design cases, designers are no longer only focusing on layout and the expression of visual elements. Designers have begun to think about the core of the game from the gameplay itself, and then apply it to the design.</p>
<p>——This is the core competitiveness of game interaction designers.</p>
<p>Game interaction, as a branch of Internet interaction, is not feasible to completely copy the design thinking of the Internet. Games, as one of the branches of art products, should also be full of artistic features in their design. This also requires us as game interaction designers to think deeper, so sometimes we need to regard ourselves as “half a planner”, to think about the game play itself, and to immerse ourselves in the worldview, only with heart can we make interesting things.</p>
