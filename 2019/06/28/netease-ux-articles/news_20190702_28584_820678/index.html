<p>Last week, a colleague shared the interaction design in game settlement. From a macro perspective, they shared and reflected on the existing settlement design, and concluded that a good settlement should be able to weaken the sense of victory and defeat, shift emotions, and increase the fun of the game, rather than just the notification of victory and defeat and the accumulation of data. I happened to be working on the settlement part recently, so I would like to share some detailed insights on the design of the settlement interface.</p>
<p>First of all, before designing the settlement interface, we need to think about why our game needs settlement. Is it to determine the winner, to reward players, or to allow players to summarize the experience of this battle? The settlement interface is not a single page, but a long string of player experience. Distinguishing the primary and secondary design goals can help us effectively guide the specific design.</p>
<p>For example, the victory&#x2F;defeat animation after a game is the first part of the settlement that players come into contact with. At this time, if you need to emphasize the result of victory or if there is very complicated settlement content later, then use exaggerated animation to display it in the design without adding other information. This often appears in relatively strong competitive games, and victory or defeat itself is also one of the core driving forces of players. However, attention should be paid to the transfer and comfort of the frustration of failure, and the situation of player loss due to the frustration of game failure should be reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2Fe08ef5cc-4ba4-4451-9ef6-42556c21ec82.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;e08ef5cc-4ba4-4451-9ef6-42556c21ec82.jpg"></p>
<p>If we want to emphasize the rewarded items or the player’s score. To attract players through generous prizes and changes in ratings, we can consider reducing the proportion of wins and losses, and adding to rewards. Rewards can even be made into a separate screen of animation to enhance the joy of players, and shift their focus from winning or losing. For ratings, rising in the rankings and surpassing oneself can bring a strong sense of satisfaction to players.</p>

<p>Next, according to “why”, we design “what we want”, that is, what information we need to give to players, which is more important, which is of concern to all players, and which is what high-end players want to see. At this stage, it is necessary to sort out the structure of information in detail with the planner. Many times, the planning draft received by the interaction designer is already categorized by the planner, such as the planning case of the personal record page, the planning case of the team record, etc. They have placed the information from the perspective of the planner, but whether the player is willing to read it and whether they can understand it needs to be considered by the interaction designer. Therefore, when doing this part of the content, you must control the information as a whole, and not just design a single page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2Fe25b1f51-bab8-4d55-b7e2-71ced466e475.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;e25b1f51-bab8-4d55-b7e2-71ced466e475.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition, many times the planner itself is also the most senior player of this game, so many times the plan given by the planner is not friendly to novice players, and novice players will get lost in the ocean of data and cannot find the key points. At this time, it is necessary to do subtraction. A more common method is to divide the information into levels, and hide the more in-depth and secondary information into other tabs or pop-up windows, which can better highlight the core data, and hardcore players can also choose to view more complex information.</p>
<p>Finally, there is how to display. Excel-style data will make players lose interest in viewing. Introducing some three-dimensional models or dynamic visualization data can greatly improve the readability of the data. For example, in <em>Dota 2</em>, players can choose different characters for data comparison, and the economic curve trend chart in <em>Honor of Kings</em> can give players a clearer understanding and feeling of the game.</p>

<p>Settlement is the final stage of a game. It is a stage for players to summarize themselves and feedback on the game experience. It is not just cold data and cutscenes, but it can also help players understand the game, improve their skills, and warm up for the next game. A large part of the player’s sense of accomplishment comes from this. Therefore, more design thinking should be invested in the design.</p>
