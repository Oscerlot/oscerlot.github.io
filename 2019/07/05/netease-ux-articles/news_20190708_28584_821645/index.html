<p>In recent years, many well-known font foundries have been commissioned by large enterprises and public organizations to create and develop thousands of custom corporate fonts. The brand image, as a concrete manifestation of the brand, is composed of many elements, such as: logo, font, brand color, packaging, IP image, etc. Each aspect affects the user’s perception of the brand.</p>
<p>Large enterprises have a wide variety of products under their umbrella, but their logos are diverse, making unification difficult. Using a unified brand font is a simple and effective way to improve the recognition of corporate products.</p>
<p>Speaking of brand font design, we have to mention Akira Kobayashi, a Western font designer who has designed brand fonts for both Alibaba and Tencent in recent years. The following introduces some basic knowledge introduced by Mr. Kobayashi in Western fonts.</p>
<h2 id="1-Western-Fonts"><a href="#1-Western-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="1. Western Fonts"></a>1. Western Fonts</h2><p>Western writing refers to all Western languages, including English, French, German, etc. Compared with Chinese and Japanese characters, Western writing does not have such a long history. Starting from Greek inscriptions, it took about 2000 years for the writing of the Roman Empire to take shape in the 1st century AD.</p>
<p>The classic proportions of the Trajan’s Column inscription in Rome are our best example of capital letters. Later, scribes in medieval monasteries and humanists in the 15th century created contemporary writing styles. Various fonts were born in the following centuries.</p>
<p>Some classic fonts commonly used now are: Helvetica, Arial, Didot, Futura, Univers, Neo Sans, Myriad, Times New Roman, etc.</p>
<h2 id="2-Technical-Terms"><a href="#2-Technical-Terms" class="headerlink" title="2. Technical Terms"></a>2. Technical Terms</h2><p><strong>Glyph &amp; Typeface</strong></p>
<p>“Glyph” refers to the characteristic stroke direction and stroke position of a character that distinguishes it from other characters. If the glyph is compared to the skeleton, then the typeface is equivalent to the muscle attached to the skeleton. For example, SimSun and SimHei have the same glyphs, but different typefaces.</p>
<p>The glyphs of Microsoft YaHei are significantly different from them, mainly in the direction of the strokes.</p>
<p>[Image: Comparison of SimSun, SimHei, and Microsoft YaHei]</p>
<p><strong>Roman Typeface (Serif Typeface)</strong></p>
<p>Roman type, the more authoritative explanation for the origin of serifs is that it is a remnant of the traces of writing with a flat-headed pen when drafting inscriptions in the Roman era.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Serif Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Italic</strong></p>
<p>Italic is a handwriting style used in Italy. The font formed by simply tilting the outline data of the Roman typeface is called “oblique.”</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Italic Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Sans-serif Typeface</strong></p>
<p>In French, “sans” means “without”, and sans-serif means “without serifs”. Sans-serif fonts are ubiquitous in the Internet age.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Sans-Serif Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Script Typeface</strong></p>
<p>[Image: Example of Script Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter Typeface</strong></p>
<p>Also called Gothic, because of its high blackness, it is also called “broken letter”.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Blackletter Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Stem</strong></p>
<p>The main stroke of a letter, usually refers to the straight part of the stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Bowl</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the curved strokes of uppercase letters C or O, or lowercase letters b or o.</p>
<p><strong>Counter</strong></p>
<p>The internal space contained in the letter, whether closed or not, such as the area between the two vertical strokes of H or n.</p>
<p><strong>Hairline</strong></p>
<p>The part of the thin stroke.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Stem, Bowl, Counter and Hairline]</p>
<p><strong>Serif</strong></p>
<p>The part with a claw-like or straight shape at the end of the stroke.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bracket Serif</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hairline Serif</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slab Serif</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Swash</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the particularly elongated strokes at the beginning and end of letters, with decorative curved parts.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Swash]</p>
<p><strong>Baseline</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the imaginary line that the bottom of the uppercase letter H or the lowercase letter ∩ touches. The bottom of letters such as O, V, and W deliberately exceeds the baseline slightly, in order to be visually level with the baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Cap Height</strong></p>
<p>Cap refers to the height from the baseline to the top of straight uppercase letters such as H or E. The top line of H or E is called the capline. The top of letters such as O and A will exceed the capline slightly, in order to unify the letter size visually.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Baseline and Cap Height]</p>
<p><strong>x-height</strong></p>
<p>[Image: Showing x-height]</p>
<p>Compared with the cap height of uppercase letters, in order to refer to the height of lowercase letters, x without upper and lower extensions is used as the representative of lowercase letters, and its height is named x-height.</p>
<p><strong>Kerning</strong></p>
<p>Designers will adjust the width of each character. In Western font design, the end of letter shape design does not mean the completion of the work, but rather that the work is only half done, because there are still hidden and important projects such as letter spacing and kerning settings.</p>
<p>In this UCan conference, Akira Kobayashi compared font design to the propagation of sound. For a font, its letter spacing and whitespace represent its breath and rhythm.</p>
<p>Apple made special style adjustments to the word “click” on the OS X El Capitan official website introduction page, making the letter spacing larger so that the letters of the word would not look like “dick” because they are too close together.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing adjustment to “click” on Apple Website]</p>
<p>For large enterprises, fonts are no longer simply “readable”. Even foreign language fonts must be used in conjunction with the brand image. Although the languages are different, from the perspective of font design, it can reduce the gap between users in various countries. Understanding the design and application of Western fonts can improve the designer’s design ability and artistic quality.</p>
