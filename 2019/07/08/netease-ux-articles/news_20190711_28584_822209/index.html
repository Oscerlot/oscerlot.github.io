<p>The camera angle is the perspective from which we observe the game. Different games will set different camera angle types for players to choose from.  Convenient operation, not getting lost easily, and a strong sense of immersion are the basis for players to choose a camera angle type. So, what are the common camera angle types in games, and what do these types mean? If a player reports that the camera rotation is uncomfortable, how does a user researcher view and analyze this problem? Today, we will introduce two parts – the game’s operating modes (i.e., different camera angle types) and related camera parameters.</p>

<p>2D camera angle means that the game only has two dimensions of perspective – up and down, left and right. This camera angle appeared in the earliest arcade games, such as <em>Contra</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>MapleStory</em>, etc., and also in some current parkour games, such as the <em>Ninja Must Die</em> series.</p>

<p>In this camera angle type, the player’s camera angle is still fixed, similar to a god’s-eye view. At this time, clicking the left mouse button can reach the designated position, and the right mouse button has no function. WASD controls the character’s forward, backward, left, and right movement. Compared to the 2D camera angle, this fixed camera angle provides forward and backward movement of the character, but the player’s camera angle does not change with the character’s perspective. The game still looks like a plane and does not have a three-dimensional feeling, so this camera angle is between 2D and 3D, which is a 2.5D camera angle.</p>
<p>Currently, some PC games still retain this camera mode, such as <em>JX3</em> and <em>New Chinese Ghost Story</em>, etc. The advantage is that it is easy to operate, and you can move by clicking the mouse. The left hand only needs to press the skill keys on the keyboard. The disadvantage is that the sense of immersion is not as strong as 3D.</p>
<h3 id="3-Traditional-3D-Mode"><a href="#3-Traditional-3D-Mode" class="headerlink" title="3. Traditional 3D Mode"></a>3. Traditional 3D Mode</h3><p>Press and hold the left mouse button to rotate the camera, and press and hold the right mouse button to rotate the camera and character orientation. WASD controls the character’s forward, left&#x2F;right strafing, and backward movement.  Examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p>
<h3 id="4-Free-Camera-Angle"><a href="#4-Free-Camera-Angle" class="headerlink" title="4. Free Camera Angle"></a>4. Free Camera Angle</h3><p>Compared to 2.5D, the traditional 3D mode provides the function of rotating the camera angle, that is, pressing and holding the right mouse button can rotate the camera and character orientation, and clicking the left mouse button can reach the designated position. At the same time, WASD controls the character’s forward, backward, left, and right movement. For example, in the <em>New Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game PC version, right-click and hold can rotate the camera and character orientation.</p>

<h3 id="5-Action-3D-Mode"><a href="#5-Action-3D-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Action 3D Mode"></a>5. Action 3D Mode</h3><p>Commonly found in current MMO and FPS games, such as <em>Blade &amp; Soul</em> mode, <em>Moonlight Blade</em> action mode. Moving the mouse can rotate the camera and character orientation. The left and right mouse buttons can be set for skills. WASD controls the character’s forward, left&#x2F;right strafing, and backward movement. In this camera angle mode, the left and right mouse buttons are freed from being used for camera angle conversion and movement, and usually have other functions that can be assigned to the left and right mouse buttons, such as some basic skills, shooting, and aiming in FPS games.</p>
<h2 id="II-Some-Commonly-Used-Camera-Settings"><a href="#II-Some-Commonly-Used-Camera-Settings" class="headerlink" title="II. Some Commonly Used Camera Settings"></a>II. Some Commonly Used Camera Settings</h2><p>The camera mode is a relatively general category of viewing angles. Usually, a game will set a variety of game camera parameters for players to adjust by themselves. This part will popularize and introduce these parameters.</p>
<h3 id="1-Camera-Rotation-Sensitivity"><a href="#1-Camera-Rotation-Sensitivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera Rotation Sensitivity"></a>1. Camera Rotation Sensitivity</h3><p>Camera rotation sensitivity is the most commonly used camera parameter. The principle is that when the perceived amplitude or frequency of movement exceeds a certain appropriate value, the nerve center will cause discomfort, such as dizziness and nausea, to objectively achieve the purpose of preventing the current movement from continuing. This is actually a self-protection mechanism, because large-amplitude and high-frequency movements may cause damage to the human body.</p>
<p>When playing games, especially in action 3D mode, the camera rotation is convenient and only relies on mouse movement, which can easily lead to the camera rotation speed being too fast, causing players to experience 3D motion sickness, get lost, etc. However, if the camera rotation speed is too slow, in more intense fighting operations, the camera rotation will not be able to keep up with the enemy’s movement. For example, some players have reported: “The camera rotation after locking is really slow. If someone flashes behind you, you still have to manually turn around?”</p>
<p>Therefore, providing adjustable camera rotation sensitivity in the game is beneficial to improve the user experience, such as in <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword Mobile</em>.</p>

<h3 id="2-Perspective-Angle"><a href="#2-Perspective-Angle" class="headerlink" title="2. Perspective Angle"></a>2. Perspective Angle</h3><p>If the FOV (field of view) value is too large, the screen will display more scenes, but the scenes at the edges will be severely stretched. This will produce a continuous stretching effect when turning around, which is very different from the effect seen when the human eye rotates. Some FOVs are too small, like running with a telephoto lens. The characters on the screen are very large, but the image changes quickly during the movement, and the human eye will also not adapt.</p>
<h3 id="3-Viewing-Angle"><a href="#3-Viewing-Angle" class="headerlink" title="3. Viewing Angle"></a>3. Viewing Angle</h3><p>The distance and size of the picture. The closer the distance or the larger the picture, the stronger the sense of presence, which will make the player more immersed, and thus be disturbed by the actions in the game, resulting in dizziness.</p>
<h3 id="4-Frames-Per-Second"><a href="#4-Frames-Per-Second" class="headerlink" title="4. Frames Per Second"></a>4. Frames Per Second</h3><p>The FPS (frames per second) value should be stable. For example, for a head-turning action, you originally wanted to turn 90 degrees in 1 second, but the FPS is unstable and half a beat slower, causing the brain to think it is in place, but the result returned by the eyes is that it is not in place, which will cause the player to experience dizziness.</p>
<h3 id="5-Depth-of-Field"><a href="#5-Depth-of-Field" class="headerlink" title="5. Depth of Field"></a>5. Depth of Field</h3><p>Too much depth of field will make it difficult for the human eye to focus, and multiple focusing difficulties can easily lead to dizziness. Too little will cause image accumulation and the picture will lack a sense of layering, resulting in dizziness.</p>
<p>And some games use “dynamic blur” in the picture to restore the scene seen by the human eye as much as possible, that is, objects moving in the relative direction of the line of sight will appear blurred or shaken, so reduce the “dynamic blur” in the game scene (but reducing it too much will cause the picture to appear intermittent).</p>
<p>Therefore, if a player says that the camera angle conversion is uncomfortable and the camera rotation is a bit dizzy, as a user researcher, you need to think from multiple game aspects and find targeted points for improvement in the game, such as:</p>

<p>Camera angle and target locking are two inseparable game problems. Locking, that is, the selection of the attack target and the locking mechanism, includes free unlocked mechanisms, priority locking mechanisms under various conditions (such as closest distance, lowest health, most recently attacked), intelligent locking mechanisms, and various unlocking mechanisms, etc. Locking is closely related to the camera angle. For example, if a player wants to adjust the follow rate of the attack camera angle, they must first confirm that the game locking state is in unlocked attack mode, such as in <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword Mobile</em>.</p>
