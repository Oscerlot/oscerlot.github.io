</blockquote>
<p>As an interaction designer in a middle platform, we often need to quickly take on new games, connect with upstream and downstream as soon as possible, improve processes, and ensure the implementation of requirements. So, how can we quickly get started with this kind of new game? Based on my recent work experience, I think we should start from the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Type</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, game types are often hybrid. What we need to do is to break it down and see what types it is composed of, so as to find competing products, and then look at the expectations of new games from the player base of competing products. For example, Apex Legends is a professional competitive + battle royale type of game. We see that before its release, there were many competing products in the market for professional competitive and battle royale types, but the combination area was still a blue ocean.</p>
<p>As an interaction designer, when getting started with a new game, you also need to start by clarifying the product type and familiarizing yourself with these competing games, understanding the feelings of existing players, and then bringing in this identity to experience the game feelings of the new project you joined, and conduct an initial user experience run-through.</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Progress</strong></p>
<p>Games have many systems. When taking on a new project, we also need to clarify the current system completion status of the game, because the construction and optimization costs of different systems are different, and the design purposes are also different. For example, interfaces such as settlement emphasize expressiveness, while systems such as mail, chat, and settings pay more attention to unity. The picture shows a system classification form that I often refer to.</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Risks</strong></p>
<p>After understanding the project type and development progress, the next step is to know what you are going to do. Clarify the risks involved.</p>
<p>When I first joined the project, I felt that the biggest risk was time, which included three aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just arrived at the project, need time to get familiar with the team and process.</li>
<li>Just arrived at the project, need time to learn the UGUI of the Unity engine.</li>
<li>Testing will be conducted within a month, but many interfaces of the game have not yet been designed.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are indeed very tricky problems, and I was once at a loss. So I still sorted out the problems and solved them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>1. Determine Responsibilities and Processes</strong></p>
<p>In the traditional design process, it is more like a linear process. The requirements are given to interaction, the interaction is designed and then given to visual, and then developed and implemented. But in my current project, the connections between these processes are more.</p>
<p>In the face of this situation, there is only one suggestion:</p>
<p>Take the initiative to communicate, and run more to talk face to face!</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn to Use Tools</strong></p>
<p>At NetEase, in order to ensure the final restoration of the system, the interface splicing is done by the interaction designer. In the process of making games with the Unity engine, I think the main points to pay attention to are the following 4 points:</p>
<p><em><strong>Interface splicing, animation production, experience testing, resource management</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Interface splicing: In the process of interface splicing, it is mainly necessary to pay attention to restoring the effect diagram as much as possible, ensuring that the positions of corresponding elements are accurate, the font size and color number are consistent, and there are no missing states; pay attention to the adaptation of different screens, the following of elements and the hierarchical relationship.</em></li>
<li><em>Animation production: Simple animations can help players clarify state changes. Pay attention to the corresponding relationship, position, and hierarchical relationship when making.</em></li>
<li><em>Experience testing: The engine is often the place where new game mechanics first appear. The interaction designer should experience new maps, actions, and scenes in time; then after each splicing, it must be tested! Be sure to ensure that there are no errors before handing it over to others to upload to the public storage.</em></li>
<li><em>Resource management: The UI resources and atlas packaging of the game are also maintained by the interaction designer. Remember to clean up useless resources in time; check existing resources more, find optimization points in time, and optimize.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, getting started with a new project is a process that requires rapid adaptation and integration, and requires strong communication skills with people and things. The above introduction is all my personal experience, from understanding the game to understanding people to understanding tools, and gradually getting started with the project. I hope it can serve as a starting point and bring some inspiration to everyone.</p>
