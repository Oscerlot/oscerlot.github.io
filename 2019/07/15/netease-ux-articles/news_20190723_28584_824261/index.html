<p>Why do we analyze Steam sentiment? Of course, it’s because we have a game recently launched on Steam, which is—<em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>! Interested friends can download and experience it, and show your support!</p>
<p><em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> is a large-scale tactical action online game set in the Ming Dynasty. You will command your troops while fighting on the front lines, launching 15v15 siege battles; and in the vast Eurasian world, conquer cities and create an epic!</p>
<p>Now, let’s get to the point. Regarding the Steam sentiment part, how can we find the reviews we need? What indicators and content should we pay attention to? How reliable are these indicators? And how to read and use the main reviews?</p>
<p>First of all, how do we find the reviews we need? Currently, the reviews are located at the bottom of our product store page. There is a filter box here, sorted by result, by language, by purchase method, and by display score. Filter out the required reviews according to your own needs, and then analyze and summarize them, so that the effect is good.</p>
<p>Then there is the overall rating of the game by players on Steam. The current rating has some text descriptions and also the favorable rating. As shown in the figure below, the current positive rating accounts for 97%, and the text description is “Overwhelmingly Positive.”</p>
<p>Let me ask a small question. Are the ratings in Steam real ratings? Not necessarily. This is the same as buying things on Taobao and rating apps in the Apple Store. Everyone should have heard of the five-star praise梗 (gěng - a Chinese internet slang, referring to something funny or a meme, in this context refers to a sarcastic phrase or inside joke). (Could you provide an image of a “five-star negative review”?) Below is an example of a review from one of our players. He recommends it to other users, but in fact, the descriptions of the shortcomings are all problems of our game, and the emotion tends to be negative, so it means not recommended. So, according to this situation, we can infer the actual positive rating based on the player’s actual expression to make an overall assessment.</p>
<p>Next, I will give you a brief introduction to the main part of our Steam sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>This contains the player’s personal information, how many games he has, and what games they are. This information can be used to effectively assess the player’s type and game experience.</li>
<li>Whether the player is a player who is keen to write reviews, and his historical reviews, you can see the points that players pay more attention to.</li>
<li>This is the length of time the player has experienced. You can combine the length of experience with the focus of the comment content to get the short-term and long-term pain points and cool points of the game.</li>
<li>This is the main content. The analysis points are different, but you should be familiar with the game before analyzing.</li>
<li>Likes of user comments to discover excellent reviews.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every day, our game will have new players joining, and new reviews will be generated, so we also need to follow up in time and iterate our views and opinions on a certain time cycle.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction to our Steam sentiment analysis. I hope everyone can apply it flexibly.</p>
