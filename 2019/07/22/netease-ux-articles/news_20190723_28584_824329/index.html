<p>As a User Experience Researcher (UE), one of the enviable parts of the job is being able to legitimately play games during work hours. This is not slacking off, but an important part of UE’s work - game inspection.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Game-Inspection"><a href="#What-is-Game-Inspection" class="headerlink" title="What is Game Inspection?"></a>What is Game Inspection?</h2><p>Game inspection is actually playing games with a clear purpose, and ultimately producing a game inspection checklist. The purpose of the inspection may be to find problems in the game, or to study the characteristics of competing products.</p>
<p>Compared with QA testing games, UE’s game inspection not only focuses on game bugs, but also pays more attention to problems in the game experience. Novice experience, operation fluency, UI interaction, and various contents that will affect the game experience are all within the scope of the inspection, but there will be different focuses according to the purpose of the inspection.</p>

<h2 id="What-Can-Game-Inspection-Be-Used-For"><a href="#What-Can-Game-Inspection-Be-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="What Can Game Inspection Be Used For?"></a>What Can Game Inspection Be Used For?</h2><p>Game inspection can be applied to all stages of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Development:</strong> UX regularly inspects the version, finds and fixes problems during development; some controversial issues can also be the focus of subsequent player testing.</li>
<li><strong>During laboratory testing:</strong> As a summary of player feedback problems in the test, it usually comes with a list of problems</li>
<li><strong>After launch:</strong> It can be used to test new version content, and may also inspect competing games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among them, the focus of competing product inspection is not to find problems, but to study the design ideas of competing products and discover the highlights&#x2F;features of the game</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-the-Inspection-Checklist-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-the-Inspection-Checklist-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Inspection Checklist Look Like?"></a>What Does the Inspection Checklist Look Like?</h2><p>There is no fixed format for the inspection checklist, but it needs to clearly explain the ins and outs of the problem. Generally speaking, it should include the following elements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190723%2Fbf4af2ff-8e43-4a3b-920d-596a732036c8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190723&#x2F;bf4af2ff-8e43-4a3b-920d-596a732036c8.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem point:</strong> What is the problem, which system is it located in, what is the manifestation of the problem or its impact on the player</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem scenario:</strong> The problem that occurs under what model and what situation can be accompanied by related pictures and texts. The problem scene can effectively help the product reproduce and locate the problem</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem level:</strong> A level of the severity of the problem is determined according to the degree of obstruction of the problem, the frequency of the problem, and the scope of the problem. Conventional problem levels are divided into four levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Level 1 problems represent very serious problems, located in important modules and causing obstacles that a large number of players cannot solve by themselves.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 2 problems represent serious problems, located in relatively important modules and directly hindering many players.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 3 problems represent relatively serious problems, which hinder or cause poor experience for some players, and have a greater impact on the game progress or overall quality experience.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 4 problems represent general problems, which have hindered or caused poor experience for a small number of players, but have little overall impact on the game progress and quality.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-Else-Can-We-Do-with-Game-Inspection"><a href="#What-Else-Can-We-Do-with-Game-Inspection" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can We Do with Game Inspection?"></a>What Else Can We Do with Game Inspection?</h2><p>Game inspection does not have a narrow, rigid process requirement, and has considerable flexibility, as long as it can have a logical idea to set the inspection content and clearly present it. We can even inspect the video of the anchor playing the game, such as the strategy used by the anchor, operating habits, emotional changes, etc., which can become useful information. Play your creativity.</p>
