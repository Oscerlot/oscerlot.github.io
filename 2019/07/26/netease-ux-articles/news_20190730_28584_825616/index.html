<p><em>July, the scorching airflow roasts the road surface, and the young people on the street seem to be sizzling squids, constantly sweating. The sun seems to have no intention of “stopping for today” and continues to thrust its passion into this somewhat weary world. I lie on an IKEA beach chair that cost 100 yuan, gulping down ice-cold fresh watermelon juice while fantasizing about the sunset beach of Swansea.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situationalization</strong></p>
<p>Situational design is about letting you feel the temperature of the sun through the screen. The design itself does not emphasize allowing players to achieve their goals as quickly as possible, but rather allowing players to incorporate emotional changes during the operation process, ultimately leaving a deep impression.</p>
<p>Successful emotional design can help games stand out in homogeneous competition, improve user loyalty and recognition, and allow users to spontaneously participate in the dissemination of the game.</p>
<p>Situationalization can be said to be an add-on to interaction design. On the basis of interactive usability and ease of use, it allows players to obtain a richer and higher-quality process experience. The so-called flow state is that wonderful moment!</p>
<p><strong>Situationalization is More Than Just Games</strong></p>
<p>The concept of situationalization does not only exist in games, but often appears in life. As mentioned in “Designers Need to Understand Psychology,” people are more willing to listen to stories than to resumes. The description of story scenarios can better help people understand the content you want to express, and it is also more immersive, containing more emotional expression.</p>
<p>In fact, we have all been exposed to situationalization since we were very young. If you still remember the inspirational stories you wrote in the examination room, and the dark clouds and heavy rain in the stories. In fact, this is the most natural situational design. Through various strange weather environments, it expresses and renders the tragic experience and mood of the protagonist, guides the reader to resonate, and promotes the plot. In games, it’s like this.</p>
<p>Players will not improve their clearance rate or experience better operation because of this design, but the immersion of the environment will enhance their emotional experience during the game, and even push it to a climax in the game!</p>
<p><strong>Situationalization and Interactive Experience in Games</strong></p>
<p>Here I recommend two situational design games that are worth playing. If you are interested, you can download and experience them.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></p>
<p>Players will explore the East India Company merchant ship “Obra Dinn,” which was missing and drifting outside in 1808 and was finally discovered, from a first-person perspective.</p>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship “Obra Dinn” left the port in London, fully loaded with more than 200 tons of trade goods and headed for the Far East. But six months later, it did not appear at the loading and unloading stop in the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, and was declared missing at sea.</p>
<p>Until the early morning of October 14, 1808, the merchant ship “Obra Dinn” slowly drifted into the port, with the sails severely damaged and no crew members visible. As an insurance estimator from the London office of the East India Company, the protagonist boarded the ship to assess the insurance, find a way to restore the crew roster, and further discover what happened on the ship.</p>
<p>When the player first boards the ship, the boatman cannot carry the box and needs the player to take out the things in the box. You will find that in addition to the magical pocket watch, there is also a booklet. This booklet has hundreds of pages and contains not only the previous roster, but also all the important content needed to play this game. As the game progresses and the player explores, this content will gradually become richer.</p>
<p>There are many interactions with the scene in the game, as well as many wonderful props; and they are handed over to the player to discover through some inadvertent moments.</p>
<p><em>Donut County</em></p>
<p>With “a (growing) hole that devours everything” as the core gameplay, coupled with a fresh and lovely art style, even without the background bonus of publisher Annapurna and developer Ben Esposito, <em>Donut County</em> is enough to whet players’ appetites. The six-year development process and the plagiarism storm that occurred near the release are certainly regrettable, but the final <em>Donut County</em> that appears in front of us has too much irreplaceability beyond the gameplay.</p>
<p>Around the design of the hole, <em>Donut County</em> tells an allegorical adult fairy tale in a form similar to a fireside chat. Every line of dialogue seems to be carefully written, and in this process, the shaping of the group portrait is extremely successful. Of course, the most popular character is the philosophical raccoon. The game’s bestiary is like his poetry collection.</p>
<p>There are almost no fixed UI elements in the game screen, and all interactions are guided by the player during the game. This makes the game experience itself smooth and unstoppable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the purpose of situationalization itself can be divided into two types. One is to create an atmosphere to make the player’s emotional experience richer; the other is to integrate the functional interaction itself into the game’s plot. At this time, the player will probably think, “Oh, can I click this?” or “Ah, it seems that I need to open this door?”; when the player really triggers the interaction, they will exclaim WOW, Awesome.</p>
<p>So on such a hot day, when you see a glass of iced watermelon juice, you will definitely want to pick it up and imagine your sunset beach.</p>
