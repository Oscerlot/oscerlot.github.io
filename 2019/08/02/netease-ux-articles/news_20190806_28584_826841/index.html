<p>Although game interfaces are more free and lively than internet APP product interfaces, the layout design of game interfaces still needs to follow certain principles. This article shares four principles of design: <strong>contrast, proximity, unity, and alignment</strong>.</p>
<p>To better understand, the following uses the X game interface as a carrier for explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2F269ddf40-62bd-4b65-89ef-b41a2b2ed97c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;269ddf40-62bd-4b65-89ef-b41a2b2ed97c.jpg"></p>
<p>Its interface GUI design was not ugly at the time, but the entire interface gave a strong sense of clutter. This is because it did not follow the principles of proximity, contrast, and unity in the four design principles.</p>
<h3 id="Contrast-Principle"><a href="#Contrast-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Contrast Principle"></a>Contrast Principle</h3><p>The principle of contrast means highlighting what should be highlighted and weakening what should be weakened. When designing the interface, the planner will often give a lot of information that needs to be put up, but the designer cannot just pile it up. It is necessary to sort out the information first, place the key information in the visual core position, and emphasize it, such as more refined GUI beautification, larger and more gorgeous fonts, and so on. Other less important information needs to be relatively weaker.</p>
<p>The information content in the screen, each wants to highlight itself, and the content is scattered throughout the interface, making people not know where to look, and it is easy to miss important information.</p>
<h3 id="Proximity-Principle"><a href="#Proximity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Proximity Principle"></a>Proximity Principle</h3><p>The principle of proximity is to integrate similar information together. For example, the primary buttons on the screen, refining, lineup, learning, illustrations, etc., need to be placed in a connected position. Player information, the name on the screen, intimacy, technical travel and combat power also need to be integrated together.</p>
<h3 id="Unity-Principle"><a href="#Unity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Unity Principle"></a>Unity Principle</h3><p>The principle of unity, that is, in an interface, its colors and elements need to be repeated to make it a whole. In this interface, the colors have been well unified, mainly yellow and black, so looking at the color distribution alone, without looking at the information, will not give people a too chaotic feeling. But the elements have not been repeated. There are too many elements distributed in the picture, including various sizes of fonts, flat and retro style collisions and overlaps, which increases the chaos of the interface.</p>
<p>Around the problems of the above three principles, the interaction designer iterated the interface. The following figure is the effect after the designer’s iteration. Although the overall is not as cool as before, it achieves the effect of information integration and a clear interface. Each piece of information is organized and presented, important information is placed in the visual center, the buttons are easy to operate, and the elements are also flattened as a whole. After iterating according to the four principles of design, the original chaotic interface layout was optimized into a new interface with clear information at a glance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fc1dc72f8-fe81-4a75-9408-06ae2bdb2be7.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;c1dc72f8-fe81-4a75-9408-06ae2bdb2be7.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Alignment-Principle"><a href="#Alignment-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Alignment Principle"></a>Alignment Principle</h3><p>Finally, let’s look at the significance of the alignment principle for game interface design. Alignment is the basis of interface design. The above three points may require a certain amount of accumulation by the designer to achieve, but alignment can be said to be a kind of consciousness without technical content, and it is the minimum requirement that designers need to follow. The design interface in the figure below does not follow the principle of alignment. It gives a very cheap and low-quality visual feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fcb4b8cf3-a234-4d28-b578-c4caf465b089.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;cb4b8cf3-a234-4d28-b578-c4caf465b089.jpg"></p>
<p>The interface in the figure below follows the principle of alignment. It appears very neat and clear in terms of information layout. The comparison between the two is immediately apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fad24b3ec-f005-4178-ab15-ce741c3b8139.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;ad24b3ec-f005-4178-ab15-ce741c3b8139.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, following the principle of alignment does not mean that every interface needs to rigidly layout information. In the main interface of the game, some misaligned layout styles do not affect the overall interface, but will add a little agility. The alignment principle is more used in interfaces that aim to present the content of the information itself.</p>
<p>The above four principles are summarized by game designers after years of practice, and do not represent the industry’s standards. As a designer, after a long period of accumulation, more or less, you will summarize some of your own experience and methodology. As a design beginner, learning from the experience left by predecessors can help you avoid many detours, and these four principles are the same.</p>
<p>Learn, apply, expand, but don’t be rigid.</p>
