<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190816/28584_828467.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Susan Weinschenk, from the psychological perspectives of how people observe, read, remember, think, perceive, make decisions, concentrate, and the source of human motivation and sociality, analyzes and summarizes how to apply this psychological knowledge in design. For interaction design that emphasizes user experience, it can be regarded as a must-read book.</p>
<p>The brain receives about 40 million sensory inputs per second and tries to fully parse their meaning. It will guess what we see based on past experience - heuristics.</p>
<p>Reasonable use of shapes and colors can affect what people see.</p>
<p>What others see on your website may not be what you intended. Their personal background, cultural level, familiarity with the things in front of them, and what they expect to see will all affect their observation results.</p>
<p><strong>Peripheral vision is more likely to attract attention</strong></p>
<p>People use peripheral vision when looking at a computer screen, and often judge the content of the entire page by just glancing at the peripheral vision area.</p>
<p>Although the center of the screen is an important central vision area, don’t ignore the peripheral vision area. Be sure to ensure that the peripheral content clearly shows the purpose of the webpage.</p>
<p>If you want users to focus on a certain part of the screen, don’t place animations and flashing elements in the peripheral vision area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fc54cea66-47b2-4855-a5ae-6eff40267111.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;c54cea66-47b2-4855-a5ae-6eff40267111.jpg"></p>
<p>In <em>The Last of Us</em>, in order not to interrupt the player’s immersion in the plot, the interface elements are cleverly hidden.</p>
<p><strong>People look for patterns when recognizing objects</strong></p>
<p>Since people will involuntarily look for patterns, use patterns as much as possible, and use grouping and spacing to create patterns.</p>
<p>To make an object (such as an icon) easy to recognize, draw it with simple geometric shapes. This will make the geometric ions that make up the object more obvious, thereby making it faster and easier for people to recognize the object.</p>
<p>Use two-dimensional elements more and three-dimensional elements less. The brain receives the information observed by the human eye in a two-dimensional form, so three-dimensional graphics on the screen may slow down the speed of recognition and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fab80e70b-5cb7-4592-8314-6fd4c1a0c1d4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;ab80e70b-5cb7-4592-8314-6fd4c1a0c1d4.jpg"></p>
<p>At the beginning of designing a character, the geometric relationship of the character’s silhouette should be considered. In fast-paced competitive games, different characters need to have clear geometric differences, which can prevent players from cognitive difficulties in intense battles.</p>
<p><strong>The brain has a special area for recognizing faces</strong></p>
<p>When people look at a webpage, they first recognize and react to faces (at least people without autism do).</p>
<p>On a web page, a face looking directly at the user is the most contagious, perhaps because the eyes are the most important part of the face.</p>
<p>If the eyes of a person on a webpage are looking at a nearby location or product, people tend to look at the same place, but not necessarily pay attention, just look.</p>
<p><strong>9% of men and 0.5% of women are color blind</strong></p>
<p>When designing pictures and websites, use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.vischeck.com/">www.vischeck.com</a> or colorfilter.wickline.org to check and see the effect of color blindness.</p>
<p>If you use color to represent a specific meaning (such as green for things that need urgent processing), you should also use another distinguishing scheme (things that need urgent processing should not only be set to green, but also have a box around them).</p>
<p>When designing a color scheme, consider using colors that everyone can recognize normally, such as different shades of brown and yellow. Avoid using red, blue, and green.</p>
<p><strong>The mystery of the difficulty of reading uppercase words (a point of view based on English design)</strong></p>
<p>People think that all caps are a loud and emphatic tone, and they are not used to reading them, so use them as little as possible.</p>
<p>Use all caps only when writing headlines or when you need to get the user’s attention, such as a prompt to the user before they delete an important file.</p>
<p><strong>Reading on a screen is harder than reading on paper</strong></p>
<p>Use larger fonts on the screen to reduce eye fatigue.</p>
<p>You should divide the text into several blocks and use bullet points, short paragraphs, and pictures.</p>
<p>Increase the contrast between the text and the background. Black text on a white background is the easiest to read.</p>
<p>Make sure the content is worth reading. The reading problem ultimately depends on whether the article itself interests the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term memory is limited (Example: Remember a phone number without pen and paper)</strong></p>
<p>Don’t let people’s memory be in different places, such as reading text or numbers on one page and then entering them on another page. If you do this, they are likely to forget the information and their confidence will suffer.</p>
<p>If you want people to use working memory to remember things, don’t let them do other things before completing the task. Working memory is easily disturbed, and too much sensory input will prevent them from concentrating.</p>
<p>Psychologist Alan Baddeley questioned the 7 plus or minus 2 rule. Baddeley (1986) conducted a lot of research on human memory and information processing. In addition, researchers such as Nelson Cowan (2001) have followed in his footsteps. Research now shows that the “magic number” is actually 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F629de6df-cfe2-4b1a-9e54-5245b8e48334.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;629de6df-cfe2-4b1a-9e54-5245b8e48334.jpg"></p>
<p>It is good to limit the information presented to users to 4 items, but it is not necessary. You can use classification or grouping to display more information.</p>
<p>Display no more than 4 pieces of information per group.</p>
<p>Note that users like to use auxiliary memory aids, such as notes, lists, calendars, and schedules, to reduce their dependence on brain memory.</p>
<p><strong>People are better at processing small chunks of information</strong></p>
<p>Progressive disclosure requires multiple clicks. You may have heard that website design should minimize the number of clicks required for users to get detailed information. But the number of clicks is not important, and people are very willing to click multiple times. In fact, if users can get the right amount of information with each click and are willing to continue to browse the website along the design idea, they will not notice the clicking operation at all.</p>
<p>If you have to choose between making users click and making users think, click more and think less.</p>
<p>Before you use progressive disclosure, be sure to do enough research to figure out what information most users need and when they need it.</p>
<p><strong>How difficult is it to get people’s attention? It depends on how focused they are</strong></p>
<p>As long as you give clear instructions and the task is not too time-consuming, people can concentrate and immerse themselves in it, ignoring other distractions.</p>
<p>People’s subconscious will constantly scan the surrounding environment to see if there is any information that interests them, such as their own name, food, sex, and danger.</p>
<p><strong>The closer people are to the goal, the more motivated they are</strong></p>
<p>The closer people are to the goal, the more motivated they are to complete it, especially when success is in sight.</p>
<p>After achieving the goal, motivation and purchasing power will decrease sharply. This is called the post-reward reset phenomenon. Usually, people have little patience to complete another task.</p>
<p>The risk of losing customers is highest when rewards are achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Human sociality: The upper limit of the number of people in the “strong relationship circle” is 150</strong></p>
<p>When designing a product that focuses on community relations, consider whether the interaction is designed for strong relationships or weak relationships.</p>
<p>If you are designing for strong relationships, you need to design some features that allow users to get close to each other, so that they can connect and get to know each other in the circle.</p>
<p>If you are designing for weak relationships, don’t make it the main purpose for users in the social network to directly contact or get close to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Human sensory system: Everyone has seven emotions and six desires</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F170f15f0-9474-4b51-acb2-0ccfb7e38b03.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;170f15f0-9474-4b51-acb2-0ccfb7e38b03.jpg"></p>
<p>The seven emotions of happiness, sadness, contempt, fear, disgust, surprise, and anger are universal and are expressed through facial expressions and body postures.</p>
<p>If you want to communicate with pictures (such as pictures of people on a website), using pictures that express one of the seven emotions is the most effective way to communicate.</p>
<p>People are good at reading these seven basic emotions from photos. People can often tell which emotions are fake, so try to use pictures that look real.</p>
<p>Find out which emotions can infect the target users. In addition to the basic information of users, it is also necessary to clarify and record their psychological conditions, such as which emotions are most infectious or most likely to stimulate various psychological activities of target users.</p>
<p><strong>People always make mistakes, there is no completely fault-tolerant product</strong></p>
<p>To design a product or game that persuades people to take specific actions, you need to understand the subconscious motivations of the target group.</p>
<p>When people tell you the reasons for their specific actions, you should be skeptical. Because decisions are made in the subconscious, they may not know the real reason for their decisions.</p>
<p>Although people make decisions based on certain subconscious factors, they also want to find a reasonable reason for the decision. So you still need to provide users with some reasonable reasons, even if they are not the real reasons that make them make the decision.</p>
<p>When designing game interactions, we often hope that players will act according to our own designs from the perspective of designers. We give players some abilities and hope that they will follow suit. In fact, it is more important to understand the psychology of players, analyze and use the mental model of players, so that the game can become what we want it to be, and players will listen to the “suggestions” of the designer and feel that this is exactly what they want.</p>
