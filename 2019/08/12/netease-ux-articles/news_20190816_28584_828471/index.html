<p>For a game, the novice guidance is the first door that players open to the game. Whether the novice guidance is good or not is crucial. Complex and difficult novice guidance can easily “dissuade” newbies, while boring and repetitive novice guidance will make “veterans” feel bored. Both results may lead to player churn during the novice guidance stage, thereby reducing the game’s retention rate.</p>
<p>Therefore, testing the novice guidance is very important. The intuitive feedback from the test can optimize the novice guidance, thereby improving the game’s retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F276e0096-9ffd-44bf-beb5-64b2eb78f1db.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;276e0096-9ffd-44bf-beb5-64b2eb78f1db.jpg"></p>

<p>The novice guidance of the game mainly bears two “missions”:</p>
<p><strong>The first mission is to enable players to master the main functional gameplay and successfully “get on the road.”</strong></p>
<p>For the mastery of functional gameplay, we need to do a lot of dismantling work before testing, that is, to organize and dismantle all the functional points involved in the current novice guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fe2ea6b56-1c5e-4b2f-968f-e1aca69b19fc.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;e2ea6b56-1c5e-4b2f-968f-e1aca69b19fc.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Novice Guidance)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Novice guidance testing does not end after the player has experienced the novice guidance and asks “Did you learn it?”. For the dismantling of functional points, we need to refine every detail, such as “move”, “dodge”, “skill release”, etc. During the test, we need to carefully confirm whether the player has learned these basic functional points. Not every content that appears for the first time in the game is very important. Basic functional points must be problems that will get stuck if they are not learned, resulting in the inability to continue the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also need to distinguish which ones are worthy of attention and which ones are not so important. For current games, most of the novice guidance is linear, that is, only one point is taught at a time, and the next point is taught after this point is taught, instead of presenting a tree shape. Because if there are too many teaching points at the same time, players will not know what they should learn. Therefore, for linear novice guidance, the order in which various functional points are taught may also be very important. These are all contents that need to be paid attention to in the test.</p>
<p>The dismantling of functional gameplay plays a great role not only in the testing of novice guidance, but also in the analysis of novice node retention. After dismantling the various guidance points in the novice period, we can bury points for these contents in advance. When the game is tested, we can see which node has a higher churn rate through data, so that we can get a more objective result.</p>
<p><strong>Another “mission” of novice guidance is to attract players through high-quality plots, animations, and other content, create a sense of substitution, and thus retain players.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Faec9e1a2-00a9-4747-8744-4750f26fdb95.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;aec9e1a2-00a9-4747-8744-4750f26fdb95.jpg"></p>

<p>So when testing, it is not just about whether the player has learned, but also about the attractiveness of the content in the novice stage. Generally speaking, novice guidance mainly makes players feel “bright” through the plot and art quality. Therefore, when conducting tests, we will pay attention to the player’s acceptance of the world view and their evaluation of the art.</p>
<p>If further subdivided, the plot can be broken down into background story, character settings, plot lines, etc., and the art can be broken down into scenes, characters, animations, special effects, etc. However, the breakdown of content is relatively subjective and not as specific as the breakdown of functional gameplay, so it can be carried out according to your own needs.</p>
<p>Novice guidance testing is not necessarily before the game is launched. After the game is launched, we also need to test the novice process. For example, for a major promotion, we hope to introduce a large number of game newbies. For these newbies, is there any problem with our guidance? Or, after the game is launched, some content of the game has actually become a benchmark. In the novice guidance test, do we still need to test these contents? These all need to be adjusted according to specific needs.</p>
