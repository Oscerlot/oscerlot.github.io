<p>Interaction design is not created out of thin air, especially in games. A unified design style can bring a better gaming experience to players and help them immerse themselves in the game itself. At the same time, a design with a source can effectively enhance the persuasiveness of the product and improve design efficiency in terms of performance.</p>
<p>In a 2015 GDC presentation, <em>Hearthstone</em> Senior UI Designer Derek Sakamoto introduced the concept of a design Seed, used to guide design style and concepts to make the game more complete, vivid, and consistent with the world, creating an immersive user interface.</p>
<p>For Derek, a Seed can be an idea, a picture, a movie, or a song, which allows the team to understand the direction of the project.</p>
<p>For <em>Hearthstone</em>, their concepts ranged from the early <em>Warcraft</em> elements of ice and fire, the map adventure elements of Azeroth, adventure book elements, forest elements, and so on. Eventually, they found the design concept of the box, and then developed a series of interesting designs, including the concepts of keys and trees. Then they thought that the box should be on a table, and what kind of environment should the table be in? Continuing the creative divergence, they got the concept of playing <em>Hearthstone</em> in a <em>Warcraft</em> tavern, which became richer and richer, and led to today’s <em>Hearthstone</em>.</p>
<p>So how do you find the Seed? Derek didn’t give a clear method, but he summarized the following experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seeds are hard to find directly, unless you’re very lucky or talented;</strong></li>
<li><strong>You should start looking in the early stages of the project, it can make project development smoother;</strong></li>
<li><strong>It can make everything better;</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you want to make an attractive and unique game, you must find the Seed.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back at the design of <em>Hearthstone</em>, from the simple flat design at the beginning, then adding 3D, adding physics, adding magic, gradually improving and deducing, and finally getting the current UI main interface.</p>
<p>Once the Seed is determined, we need to branch out through the Seed to produce many designs that conform to the theme, and even expand and extend the Seed itself. From the design and copywriting in the battlefield, the design of various peripheral systems (shop, social, etc.), and various system pages such as battle settlement, the core concept of this seed will be implemented.</p>
<p>When looking for a seed, generally starting from the positioning of the product, consider various factors, such as innovation and applicability. Just like <em>Hearthstone</em>, after determining the seed of the box, it is not convenient to design proposals such as exploring the big world. At the same time, it will also have a certain impact on scalability and some game settings themselves. Therefore, for designers, finding the Seed is only the beginning of the design, not the end. From seed to flowering and fruiting is also very important.</p>
<p>For example, in the design, in order to fill the table, the designer added some additional Easter eggs, allowing players to pass the time while playing cards and trigger various effects, giving players a different surprise.</p>
<p>In the latest Dalaran Heist adventure mode, there is a level to go to the tavern to modify the deck, which is in line with the game’s setting of the tavern as a casual and relaxing feeling.</p>
