<p>Data visualization has always been a topic I’m very interested in, although I’ve completely forgotten when I started to be attracted to it. The charm of data lies in its truthful recording of us; our good or bad is just an accumulation of numbers here. Real data is also chaotic, because we ourselves, reality itself, is chaotic.</p>
<p>To make the chaotic reality clear and simple, this is visualization.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Do-We-Need-Data-Visualization"><a href="#Why-Do-We-Need-Data-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Why Do We Need Data Visualization?"></a>Why Do We Need Data Visualization?</h2><p>“Data is too boring, I don’t want to look at it at all,” and “It’s so complicated, I can’t understand it at all” are the first reasons why we need to visualize data. Due to the limited cognitive ability of human beings, our brains are inherently unable to process a bunch of pure numbers. We need to transform numbers into something we can understand and be more sensitive to – graphics.</p>
<p>Transforming the slow reasoning and calculation process into objects that can be intuitively felt; understanding this, you have mastered all of visualization design. With a little practice, you can become a great data analyst.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Visualize-Data"><a href="#How-to-Visualize-Data" class="headerlink" title="How to Visualize Data"></a>How to Visualize Data</h2><h3 id="Basic-Elements-of-Visualization"><a href="#Basic-Elements-of-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Basic Elements of Visualization"></a>Basic Elements of Visualization</h3><p>As early as 1967, French cartographer Jacques Bertin summarized and classified people’s cognitive abilities and characteristics of graphic symbols. This research result has also been widely recognized. In the book <em>Semiology of Graphics</em>, Jacques not only discovered our sensitivity to different visual variables, but also explained in detail the types of information that different symbols can carry. This analytical theory has also become the basic principle of most data visualizations.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, our perception of graphics is divided into seven dimensions: position, size, shape, value, hue, orientation, and texture. Each visual variable has its applicable data type, and there are also differences in readability. For example, different hues can represent different variables, but when the number of hue types exceeds 20, they can no longer be quickly identified; hues can well represent categories, but cannot express sequential relationships.</p>
<p>The basis of data visualization is to use visual variables reasonably to display different types of information. Whether it is a simple Bar Chart or a beautifully named Nightingale Rose Chart, this theory can be used to analyze its design principles and rationality. When we design new visualization solutions, we also need to use these elements flexibly.</p>
<h3 id="Interesting-Charts"><a href="#Interesting-Charts" class="headerlink" title="Interesting Charts"></a>Interesting Charts</h3><p>In our work, we often build a Dashboard by using existing charts to complete simple data visualization. Therefore, understanding the types and applicable scenarios of existing charts is the first step.</p>
<p>There are many types of charts, and it is impossible to cover them all here. Interested friends can visit some visualization tool websites, which will have detailed explanations and organization. Here are a few I know.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AntV Chart Usage Manual</strong>, visualization tool; it organizes a relatively complete introduction and usage scenarios of basic charts;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tableau Visualization Library</strong>, a very famous and easy-to-use data analysis tool; the official website provides many real data visualization cases, no longer a single chart, but a combination of various charts to tell facts; you can directly interact on the chart, dig data;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gapminder</strong>, a visualization tool created by the famous Swedish data analysis professor Hans Rosling, the prototype is his research tool when he gave a TED Talk; Grandpa Hans left the world in 2017, but he used data visualization to show us the footprint of mankind in the pursuit of happiness, using a playable visualization chart to show the change of time very intuitively and vividly;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Excite-Your-Audience"><a href="#Excite-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Excite Your Audience"></a>Excite Your Audience</h3><p>How to make the chaotic reality clear and simple is what we need to pay attention to when doing visualization; but more importantly, we need to clarify the purpose of visualization. In fact, visualization is only a part of the data analysis workflow. When we need to use visualization tools, there must be a need for data analysis and presentation first. So, what we want to tell the “audience” through visualization becomes very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to prove a certain point, visualization can deceive the audience.</p>
<h3 id="Avoid-Bad-Illusions"><a href="#Avoid-Bad-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Bad Illusions"></a>Avoid Bad Illusions</h3><p>This is a point that I often find to be criticized by sharers in many data visualization conferences. What is good visualization, and how to use visual variables reasonably to display your information?</p>
<p>The first negative example is the Piechart that everyone likes very much. In many cases, Piechart cannot display information very efficiently. The reason is that pie charts often focus people’s vision on the angle change of the center, but people’s ability to perceive angles is relatively poor. As shown in the figure below, it is difficult for you to tell which is the largest color block in the three pie charts.</p>
<p>However, when we transform it into a barchart, it becomes very clear. This is because vision is extremely sensitive to position information. When we look at a barchart, our vision will naturally compare the positions of the endpoints, and we don’t even need to think more.</p>
<p>The second example, worse than Piechart, is 3D Piechart. As shown below, this is a slide from Apple’s press conference. You will find that the 19.5% part in the picture looks larger than the 21.2% part. There are also many analyses on the Internet about the misleading charts that appeared in Apple’s presentations over the years. If you are interested, you can search for it.</p>
<p>So the second point to note is that we need to use 3D cautiously. People are not sensitive to 3D information, and this will increase the cognitive burden on the audience.</p>
<p>Third, please ensure that the starting point of the vertical axis of the Barchart is the origin. As shown in the figure below, the difference between the two in the chart on the left seems to be multiple, but when we restore the starting point to zero, the difference is actually very small. The reason for this misleading is that we are comparing the difference between the two through Barchart, and the chart on the left incorrectly magnifies this difference. Therefore, before doing visualization, you must first be clear about what we want to express.</p>
<h3 id="Tell-Your-Story"><a href="#Tell-Your-Story" class="headerlink" title="Tell Your Story"></a>Tell Your Story</h3><p>Fundamentally, charts are actually comparing sizes. Even if it can be displayed clearly, you will not be able to remember their relationship and numbers for a long time. What is really left is the speaker’s point of view, your image of objective things, and your judgment on current decisions.</p>
<p>Minard was a pioneer in presenting engineering and statistical information in graphical form. His most famous work, “<em>Figurative Map of the successive losses in men of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812-1813</em>“, depicts the losses suffered by Napoleon’s army after leaving the Polish-Russian border. The chart shows six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops, distance, temperature, longitude and latitude, direction of movement, and time-location relationship. The number of troops is represented by the bandwidth, and one millimeter represents ten thousand people; beige represents the process of the army going to Russia, and black represents the process of retreating from Russia.</p>
<p>This chart fully demonstrates the historical event of Waterloo. Perhaps you had no concept of this war before, but in just a few seconds, you can feel its tragedy from the chart. You don’t need to know any of the numbers, the graph itself has conveyed its content to you.</p>
<p>Therefore, exciting visualization not only needs to clearly show the data, but also to express the content you want the “audience” to pay attention to; this may be a potential problem, it may be the cause of a certain phenomenon, or it may be a bloody fact; what is truly shocking is the story you tell through visualization.</p>
<h3 id="Ending-Hans-Rosling"><a href="#Ending-Hans-Rosling" class="headerlink" title="Ending - Hans Rosling"></a>Ending - Hans Rosling</h3><p>Speaking of which, I’m almost finished. Of course, there are still many details in visualization, which I don’t know much about, and I hope to continue to explore. Finally, I would like to share a popular data analyst, Hans Rosling. Hans Rosling’s most famous speech was when he used 120,000 data points to explain the development of 200 countries in 200 years in 4 minutes. He tried to prove whether human society is moving towards a healthier and richer direction. He uses real data to let the audience understand the answers to macroscopic propositions, and he uses visualization to vividly tell you “the world is actually like this”.</p>
<p><em>“When Hans speaks, I can see the ‘Aha moment’ on people’s faces. He can break through the mystery in an easy way.” Said Melinda Gates, Bill Gates’ wife and co-founder of the Gates Foundation.</em></p>
