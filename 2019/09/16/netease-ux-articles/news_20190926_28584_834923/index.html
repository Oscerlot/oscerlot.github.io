</blockquote>
<p>“Chicken Dinner” originated from a game in 2017, <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>. With the popularity of the gameplay, similar battle royale games have been continuously launched, gaining a large number of players. “Calling friends to get a Chicken Dinner together” is happening in more and more people’s lives. However, there is a group of people who have never been able to experience the fun of getting a “Chicken Dinner”. Once they enter the game for a period of time, they will feel dizzy, nauseous, and experience significant physical discomfort.</p>
<p>This kind of dizziness that occurs when playing highly realistic 3D games is called 3D sickness or cybersickness. In addition to “Chicken Dinner”, many games can easily cause similar symptoms. The specific manifestations vary from player to player. Some people only experience it in FPS games with strong realism, while others also suffer from playing third-person 3D games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F0ed158f7-5e67-4276-b48d-b54c519eee3a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;0ed158f7-5e67-4276-b48d-b54c519eee3a.jpg"></p>
<p>Why do people get 3D sickness?</p>
<p>3D sickness has the same principle as motion sickness and seasickness. The fundamental reason is that the eyes and the body have different feelings about “whether the body is moving”.</p>
<p>The eyes judge whether they are moving by the scene they see, while the body has another set of vestibular systems that perceive movement. It is located in the inner ear and can continuously detect the actual spatial movement of the body, and is not affected by the visual system. For example, when a person’s body is turned in complete darkness, they can still feel which way they are turning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F5adb9bff-5eb6-4622-9cce-441e008cd5b0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;5adb9bff-5eb6-4622-9cce-441e008cd5b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the signals from the eyes and the signals from the body can reach the same conclusion, and work together to help our body make corresponding adjustments. For example, when we are running, the motion signal obtained by the vestibular system can help the visual system to adjust, so that we can maintain clear vision even when the surrounding environment is constantly moving.</p>
<p>However, when playing some 3D games with realistic graphics and high-speed scene switching, the signal received by the eyes is that you are moving at high speed, and the “movement” signal is transmitted to the brain; while the vestibular system does not detect that the body is moving, and transmits the “stillness” signal to the brain. The conflict between the two signals causes physical discomfort.</p>
<p>In the environment where people live, the consistency of various sensory channels is very important, as it helps us adapt to the ever-changing world. In ancient times, our ancestors heard dull footsteps and knew what kind of beast they would face, and seeing a red-hot piece of metal, they could also predict that touching it would burn their hands.</p>
<p>Therefore, 3D sickness is actually a self-protection mechanism produced by the human brain during evolution. When different sensory organs have opposite feelings, it may mean that one is in a bad situation, and the brain wants to remind the body: stop and get out of this situation.</p>
<p>What measures can be taken to alleviate 3D sickness?</p>
<p>Starting from the principle of 3D sickness, there are two ways to alleviate 3D sickness - make the eyes realize that they are not moving, or make the body think that it is also moving.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduce the image quality</strong> so that the picture is “not so real” to the brain.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F00030c7e-0b44-4934-b916-db1c29c03863.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;00030c7e-0b44-4934-b916-db1c29c03863.jpg"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Reduce the mouse speed</strong>, which is equivalent to reducing the moving speed of the scene.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Place some objects around the screen to provide static clues.</strong> Sit a little further away from the computer screen, and try to have as many of these static objects in your field of vision as possible to help your eyes perceive the signal of stillness.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>When performing intense actions, the body and head can gently sway in the direction of the action</strong>, instead of just moving the eyes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Game Testing and 3D Sickness</p>
<p>In laboratory testing, we hope to avoid 3D sickness in recruited players as much as possible. This not only prevents players from experiencing the game and obtaining test results, but more importantly, it brings uncomfortable experiences to players. Therefore, before game testing, it is necessary to make appropriate settings for games and players to avoid 3D sickness.</p>
<p>Assessing the possibility of the test game causing 3D sickness</p>
<p>The games that are most likely to cause 3D sickness are usually first-person 3D games, but some third-person games can also cause 3D sickness if the scenes are realistic. Generally speaking, the following factors are closely related to the occurrence of 3D sickness:</p>
<ul>
<li>High image fidelity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fb136cfce-d9ae-4da6-b008-7f775c10da8f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;b136cfce-d9ae-4da6-b008-7f775c10da8f.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive picture shake</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F63fb1771-2275-4ba3-8a07-f01bc78b124c.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;63fb1771-2275-4ba3-8a07-f01bc78b124c.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>High-speed movement of scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff6deaec5-dc5c-4611-84db-a2eb7c07558c.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f6deaec5-dc5c-4611-84db-a2eb7c07558c.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>Perspective close to real height</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F60986d2a-21c3-4ec8-8dda-0373e0aa9d90.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;60986d2a-21c3-4ec8-8dda-0373e0aa9d90.jpg"></p>
<p>Make corresponding screenings when recruiting players</p>
<p>Whether 3D sickness occurs is not only related to the game, but also to the condition of the human body. Generally, people who have motion sickness and seasickness are also more likely to develop 3D sickness. When the test game has the risk of 3D sickness, you can inform the players of the risk in advance and ask about their past experiences.</p>
