<p>With the advancement of technology, gaming has developed rapidly worldwide. From the earliest 2D pixelated graphics to today’s cinematic quality, games have undergone countless innovations and iterations.  When considering which innovations have been truly groundbreaking for gaming, “face customization systems” definitely qualify.</p>
<p>Currently, there’s a trend in the gaming world where players have a large degree of customization over their characters, and customization features are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Players are encouraged to create their own in-game appearances, leading to the phenomenon of “five minutes of gameplay, two hours of face customization.” To prevent user churn right after entering the game, the face customization system is gradually becoming an important experiential feature of games, and its overall user experience design is becoming increasingly important. Below, we will examine the design of an excellent face customization system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F29c46df5-1866-453d-ad95-c37e99d417fa.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;29c46df5-1866-453d-ad95-c37e99d417fa.jpg"></p>
<p>Most current games have relatively complex face customization features. It’s important to maintain the user’s psychological comfort despite interacting with these complex controls for an extended period.  One approach is to add dynamic particles to the background interface of the face customization screen. This reduces the anxiety associated with the complexity and numerous operations involved, and also alleviates the stiffness of the character model’s expression when it’s not changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F1b355632-c929-4bb9-96de-d801422d1b80.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;1b355632-c929-4bb9-96de-d801422d1b80.jpg"></p>
<p>The face customization interface needs to highlight the core character model, while other UI layers should be relatively subdued. Visually, the UI frames on both sides of the interface can use an achromatic (grayscale) design. This reduces the visual weight of the dense UI frames on both sides, enhancing the expressiveness of the central character model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff1a25fa8-b295-4d71-9271-c358147b8e9f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f1a25fa8-b295-4d71-9271-c358147b8e9f.jpg"></p>
<p>Typically, the UI interaction hierarchy on the left side is the most complex. Making it clear and easy to understand in this context is very difficult. As can be seen in the image, the left side of the interface uses three different selection styles for the first, second, and third levels: internal fill, outer circular outline, and outer rectangular outline. The differentiation of these three selection styles allows for clear hierarchical distinction even in extreme cases where the UI background is visually weak and the three-layer UI structure is very compact, which is very rare in other games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fa6e392a0-b966-4236-9c88-78d6536e08b8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;a6e392a0-b966-4236-9c88-78d6536e08b8.jpg"></p>
<p>When the user needs to focus on detailed changes, the UI layers on both sides can interfere with visual focus and may feel cumbersome during specific operations. Therefore, as shown in the image, operations like selecting colors for specific detailed areas can hide other UI elements and enlarge the character model. This reduces the visual pressure from other UI frames, allows for better focus on the changes resulting from the operation, and also enhances the sense of immersion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff0c811d7-2334-487c-a64f-17a719cf8e68.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f0c811d7-2334-487c-a64f-17a719cf8e68.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, when there are features in the interface that need to be emphasized, they need to be differentiated from other UI controls to highlight their importance. As shown in the image, the “Face Customization Space” entry button uses a purple gradient on top of the main dark blue color, making it visually prominent. The visual richness of the entry button conveys the richness of the content accessible after entering, which is a clever design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F94855a2d-5676-4bc7-8710-2fec7e9e4316.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;94855a2d-5676-4bc7-8710-2fec7e9e4316.jpg"></p>
<p>Localized operation prompts corresponding to specific areas during face customization are common. However, in some games, these prompts appear as white patches stuck on the face, looking crude and simplistic. Furthermore, it’s difficult to perceive a sense of layering with white patches visually. Therefore, the corresponding prompt area for face customization can have a textured effect, making it look more three-dimensional. This style is more aligned with the perception of facial scanning and creates a special feeling of AI facial recognition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff22c274b-3adb-4f41-b9ac-39feb37743b5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f22c274b-3adb-4f41-b9ac-39feb37743b5.jpg"></p>
<p>The complex and lengthy nature of face customization can easily lead to user fatigue. Therefore, the design needs to evoke certain emotional fluctuations in the user. As shown in the image, the style selection for lip color is designed in the form of a lipstick palette, which is more in line with the daily usage scenarios of female players. The colors also include makeup effects that are fashionable and trendy, exceeding the player’s psychological expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the face customization experience can enhance the user’s enthusiasm in the game, just like the act of face customization itself is a part of enjoying the game.</p>
