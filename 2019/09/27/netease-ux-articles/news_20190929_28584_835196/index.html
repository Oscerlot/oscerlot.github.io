<p>When we talk about interaction design, it naturally connects to user experience. Interaction is designed to improve user experience. Designers gradually summarize their own methodologies in their work to make the user’s gaming experience smoother and give the game product the attribute of “convenience”. No matter what kind of game, most of the time, this is the purpose of interaction design.</p>
<p>Convenience can be divided into visual, auditory, tactile (operational), etc.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Visual convenience can be further divided into UI layout, UI size, etc.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the player’s visual center will be concentrated in the middle area of the screen. We can divide the screen into a nine-square grid. The player’s visual center will be concentrated in the middle area and its surroundings. When laying out the UI, most games will also concentrate important information in this area, allowing players to obtain the important information that the interface wants to present to players more quickly and conveniently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2F08c0e33f-6db2-4e3d-8bba-51bddc1017cb.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;08c0e33f-6db2-4e3d-8bba-51bddc1017cb.jpg"></p>
<p>You can observe the games on mobile phones. Although many interfaces are not directly centered, they may have a left-right&#x2F;up-down layout style. However, if you draw a frame around the important information as a whole, you can see that the overall is still concentrated towards the middle. If the important information of a game is scattered around, with pieces here and there, the player’s reading efficiency will be much lower, and such a design is relatively unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2F9b675059-694a-4c04-97e0-1907a876c415.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;9b675059-694a-4c04-97e0-1907a876c415.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(The character interface of <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword</em> is distributed left and right, but the characters and information are still centered overall)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>UI size refers to the proportion of fonts, icons, and various pop-up windows and other UIs in the interface. Designing UIs of reasonable size is one of the basic qualities that game interaction design should have. UI size can help players distinguish important information from secondary information. A comfortable UI ratio is also the foundation for players to play games for a long time. If a game’s UI cannot even be seen clearly, let alone the gameplay.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of mobile games, the most common problem when many PC games are converted to mobile games is the UI size allocation. PC games display a lot of content. Directly reducing the proportion to the mobile game interface will make it appear very crowded and small. Game designers mostly design on large screens. Looking directly at the large screen, it is easy to feel that the current proportion is already very suitable or even too large. This is very dangerous.</p>
<p>The best way is to often put the interface on the mobile phone to see the effect when making the interface. If time is tight, you can also take screenshots of mature mobile game interfaces, extract the font, icon and other sizes from its interface as a standard, and do it on this basis, which can get twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Convenience</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to vision, the area where players are convenient to operate when holding the device comfortably is often around the screen. Fortunately, these two areas do not focus on one piece, which is convenient for us to better design mobile games. For games with heavy operations, in core combat, we often design the joystick and skills on the left and right sides. Initially, it was designed for the purpose of operational convenience, but now this design has gradually become a barrier.</p>
<p>The design barrier means that new designers do not need to think too much to come up with the design of the left joystick and right attack. If there is a new game whose interaction is left attack and right joystick, it will be much more difficult for players to get started. When a function develops to the point where it is unnecessary and unsuitable to design a brand new operation, a design barrier is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Fe69a8661-1e5b-40f1-80d3-5aa6d4c35775.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;e69a8661-1e5b-40f1-80d3-5aa6d4c35775.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition to the operational convenience design of a single interface, the transition between interfaces also needs to consider the convenience of operation. Generally speaking, letting players achieve the goal with the fewest steps is what designers want to see. In traditional games, the entrances of various functions will be arranged in the main interface. Enter the secondary function interface through the main interface, and then filter the secondary functions. If you want to call up other functions, you need to return to the main interface from the secondary interface, and then select another function.</p>
<p>This is a simple page turning idea. But some games have done better, such as the rhythm game <em>Muse Dash</em>. Except for the core combat, you can directly click to enter various functional entrances no matter what interface you are in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Fb528ed31-d607-4e98-87ac-3e238f9b9037.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;b528ed31-d607-4e98-87ac-3e238f9b9037.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Ff4a9b68f-57e9-4e71-ba98-f31740d198a8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;f4a9b68f-57e9-4e71-ba98-f31740d198a8.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(In <em>MUSE DASH</em>, the display of tabs in different interfaces can directly point to the function to be entered regardless of the interface)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>However, this design is not universal, and it is more suitable for use in games with fewer total functions, otherwise it may also lead to confusion in player memory and other adverse consequences.</p>
<p>However, is the purpose of game interaction design always “convenience”? The answer is no. The word “convenience” comes from “Xunzi·Jundao”: “Its response to changes is also quick and convenient without confusion.” It means to be convenient and straightforward, convenient and light. In some game designs, it is not enough to just consider convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Design</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the game’s novice guidance design is not “convenience” from the beginning. Normally, after downloading a game, clicking to open it and you can experience the game content, is the fastest and most “convenient” process. However, the novice guide breaks this process. Most games’ novice guides do not allow skipping. Players must experience the novice before they can enter the game.</p>
<p>Now many players have more or less game experience. For them, downloading the same type of game and going through the cumbersome novice guide is likely to cause disgust. However, in the era when the game market was not so prosperous, the novice guidance of many games was missing or even non-existent. For example, a new 3D game, even if new players know that WASD can control the movement of up, down, left, and right, they don’t know what they should do, where they should go, where to pick up tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>Novice guidance is necessary for players, but its form of expression and detail can be distinguished. For example, <em>Onmyoji</em> and <em>Onmyoji Arena</em> can choose whether they are novices or veterans before starting, and choose the corresponding guidance design according to their own needs.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Interaction Design</strong></p>
<p>Emotional design, which we often talk about, uses interactive operations to influence the player’s flow and enable the player to have a better gaming experience. The purpose of this type of design is also not “convenience”.</p>
<p>For example, the card draw system common in card games. The most convenient interaction is undoubtedly to click the button to enter the card draw, enter the card draw interface, and click to draw the card. However, more and more card games have set up card draw interactions, typically <em>Onmyoji</em>‘s drawing symbols to draw cards, <em>Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen</em>‘s male protagonist interactive card draw, and so on. These operations that can be given emotional design often have some characteristics: the realization of the function itself is simple, it requires a certain price or the benefits are large, and it is easy to trigger players’ emotional resonance through interactions other than hard-core operations.</p>
<p>The purpose of game interaction design is not necessarily “convenience”. In different situations and for different purposes, the purpose of interaction design will change. Since most of the time interaction is designed around convenience, beginners may fall into the misunderstanding of “convenience” supremacy when summarizing methodologies, and miss some interesting designs. More seriously, sometimes the operation design that is considered convenient may make it difficult for players to understand. Therefore, no matter when, we must return to the perspective of user experience. First, think clearly about the purpose of the function you are responsible for, what it can bring to users, what users will expect… You cannot be preconceived and put on your own methodology. The purpose of interaction design is not absolute at any time.</p>
