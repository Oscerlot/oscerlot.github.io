<p>User research, as a new role, still faces many doubts and objections during its promotion. Because for a long time in the past, there was no such role as user research, and products were still made successfully. Today, I will introduce to you what doubts user research may face and how to deal with these doubts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-We-Have-Never-Had-a-User-Research-Role-So-We-Don’t-Need-User-Research"><a href="#1-We-Have-Never-Had-a-User-Research-Role-So-We-Don’t-Need-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="1. We Have Never Had a User Research Role, So We Don’t Need User Research."></a>1. We Have Never Had a User Research Role, So We Don’t Need User Research.</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> Many old-fashioned people will have this feeling. We have never had this role, and isn’t our product also very good?</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Not having this role does not mean that user research has not been done. Every product must have researched its target users, understood the preferences of target users, and peeked at the evaluations left by users on the Internet. And these are all doing user research work. There were no professionals to do it before, now is the time to let professionals do it!</p>
<h2 id="2-We-Are-Very-Busy-the-Schedule-is-Very-Full-and-There-is-No-Time-for-User-Research"><a href="#2-We-Are-Very-Busy-the-Schedule-is-Very-Full-and-There-is-No-Time-for-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. We Are Very Busy, the Schedule is Very Full, and There is No Time for User Research"></a>2. We Are Very Busy, the Schedule is Very Full, and There is No Time for User Research</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> The product schedule is very full, and the understanding of user research is not enough, which may cause the above-mentioned troubles for the requester. We are already very busy and have no time to do user research.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Doing user research with a small amount of time now may save a lot of time in the future. According to previous research, in the software development process alone, 60% of errors are due to incorrect user experience. User researchers can design relevant research according to the project schedule and give agile feedback in the shortest possible time. Sacrifice a small amount of time cost in exchange for future efficiency and direction, why not?</p>
<h2 id="3-We-Don’t-Have-Anything-to-Research-Now"><a href="#3-We-Don’t-Have-Anything-to-Research-Now" class="headerlink" title="3. We Don’t Have Anything to Research Now"></a>3. We Don’t Have Anything to Research Now</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> When the project is in the initial stage, there may not be a stable build, maybe just an idea, so the requester may think that we have nothing to study now.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> At any stage, there is something to study. Even if it’s just some core ideas, user researchers can do some research to help the requester understand user needs. For example, concept research can be carried out even without a demo.</p>
<h2 id="4-User-Research-Takes-a-Long-Time-and-the-Information-is-Lagging"><a href="#4-User-Research-Takes-a-Long-Time-and-the-Information-is-Lagging" class="headerlink" title="4. User Research Takes a Long Time, and the Information is Lagging"></a>4. User Research Takes a Long Time, and the Information is Lagging</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> When the version is iterating rapidly, some requesters may feel that by the time you finish the report, we have already iterated several times.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Agile feedback and advance booking can avoid delays. When the product has some ideas, it should communicate with the user researcher in time and make an appointment for related research in advance so that the research can be carried out smoothly and save time. Agile feedback means that after the research is completed on the same day, the key information is quickly fed back to the requester, and it is not necessary to wait for all the research to be completed before feedback. In addition, research information is not only useful for the current version, but also valuable for the next version.</p>
<h2 id="5-We-Don’t-Have-the-Money-to-Do-User-Research"><a href="#5-We-Don’t-Have-the-Money-to-Do-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="5. We Don’t Have the Money to Do User Research"></a>5. We Don’t Have the Money to Do User Research</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> In the case of a limited budget, the requester may feel that my money is spent on the blade, and there is no more budget for user research.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We cannot afford <em>not</em> to do this kind of research. For example, in the development stage, you can understand many usability problems by spending only a very small cost. In the later stage, the maintenance cost of these problems is usually more expensive. At the same time, user experience research is also an investment in future revenue. A good user experience can bring more profits.</p>
<p>Today, I shared with you the doubts and confusions that the requester may have in the early stage. In the future, I will continue to share with you the doubts that the requester may have in the process of doing user research. For example, is the user research method scientific? Are the conclusions reliable?</p>
