<p>When it comes to interaction design, people most often think of website interaction design and app interaction design, while game interaction design seems relatively niche. Even in the interaction design courses of many universities, students are mostly exposed to the design of conventional products, and there is very little content on game interaction design.</p>
<p>As types of interaction design, game interaction and product interaction have many things in common. Their purpose is to improve usability and user experience. So what are the special features of game interaction that are different from product interaction?</p>
<h2 id="Landscape-Orientation"><a href="#Landscape-Orientation" class="headerlink" title="Landscape Orientation"></a>Landscape Orientation</h2><p>The first and most obvious difference is that many games adopt a landscape orientation. The natural difference between the horizontal and vertical holding postures determines the different hot zones for finger touch, and thus the layout of the interface functions will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>The main holding method of a vertical screen is one-handed, and the touch hot zone is mainly concentrated in the lower left. Of course, with the increase in the size of mobile phone screens, the holding method and the touch hot zone have also changed accordingly, which will not be discussed in this article.  In contrast, landscape screens are often held with two hands, and the natural activity areas of the left and right thumbs are the most convenient places for users to touch. Therefore, the main operation area of ​​the game is usually placed on the lower left and lower right, and the auxiliary function area is placed on the upper left and upper right. The top and bottom of the screen are more inclined to place some display information that does not require operation, as these areas are less accessible.</p>

<h2 id="Information-Hierarchy"><a href="#Information-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="Information Hierarchy"></a>Information Hierarchy</h2><p>In conventional app product design, the information density of each interface is usually controlled within a certain range, such as line spacing and font size, to ensure that users can easily identify and read under normal circumstances. Content of different information levels usually uses screen transitions. For example, the list page is one interface, and clicking to view details is another interface. The situation in games is very different, especially in core battle scenarios. Frequent screen transitions will not only put huge pressure on scene loading, but also greatly disrupt the user’s gaming experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are very few interface transitions in games, which requires interaction designers to pack a large amount of information into one interface. Game interaction needs to consider the size and layout of information more, use non-full-screen information windows more, and carefully sort out the transition levels of information and the impact of transitions on user experience.</p>
<h2 id="Operation-Guidance"><a href="#Operation-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Operation Guidance"></a>Operation Guidance</h2><p>The complexity of game operations also determines the importance of novice guidance in games. Product apps often only have brief guides when new features are added or revisions are made, while games will have a longer and carefully designed novice guidance process at the beginning. Game designers spend a lot of effort on the process, content, and form of novice guidance, in order to make it easier for users to get started and more willing to stay.</p>
<p>In addition to straightforward click prompts, explanatory text, etc., some implicit guides are also worth considering. For example, for the page turning method of a list, using arrow guidance or text description is too deliberate. We usually use the form of exposing a section of a row at the edge to remind users that there is more content. In fact, if you add some more details to the animation effect of the list, the list items appear from top to bottom in sequence, and the user can more naturally receive that the list is arranged vertically and should be turned up and down.</p>
<p>For example, we can attract users’ attention through light and dark contrast, dynamic and static contrast, etc., and guide users’ visual focus shift in a natural way. The way to choose a profession at the beginning of <em>Justice Online</em> is through a small bird. The bird takes off in a relatively static scene, and the user’s sight naturally focuses on the bird. When the bird flies to one of the professional characters, the user’s sight is also naturally taken to that character. This natural form of guidance can enhance the user’s sense of immersion more than directly using highlight effects.</p>

<h2 id="Emotion-and-Atmosphere"><a href="#Emotion-and-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Emotion and Atmosphere"></a>Emotion and Atmosphere</h2><p>How to render emotion and atmosphere is a key difference between game interaction and product interaction. Conventional products are more like a tool for users, assisting users’ lives in all aspects. Games are more like an escape from life for users. How to build a smooth user experience and reduce interruptions to enhance immersion is something that game interaction needs to consider. The integration of the interface atmosphere with the game world view, the cognitive consistency between the interaction method and the actual operation method, etc., can help enhance the user’s sense of immersion.</p>
<p>As game interaction designers, how to flexibly apply these methods to the design and enhance the immersion of the game through interaction still requires us to slowly explore through continuous attempts.</p>
