<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191029/28584_844024.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the recently concluded Dota 2 “TI9 International Invitational Tournament”, the OG team from Europe defended their title, breaking the curse of no same player or same team winning twice in years. It was also these same five young men who, for the first time, shattered the myth that Chinese teams won every even-numbered year at the TI8 arena last year, crushing the dreams of countless Chinese Dota fans. In addition to endless glory, they also brought in more than $10 million in championship bonuses each year (TI9’s total prize pool exceeded $30 million, with the champion team receiving 45.5% of it, more than $14 million, which also broke the prize record set by TI itself last year) and hundreds of millions of viewers per day.</p>
<p>Dota 2, which was dubbed “Dead Game” by “Principal” Wang Sicong several years ago, has maintained many world records precisely because of its relatively complete tournament system. It cannot but be said to be one of the miracles in the history of e-sports.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2F0c831b56-6714-4832-87cd-9344e88288b5.jpg/size/" alt="TI9 International Invitational was held in Shanghai, China"></p>
<p>However, unlike games such as DotA and CSGO, which test skills, tournaments cannot be used as a core eye-catching and money-making method in MMO games. The main reasons include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Compared with MOBA, shooting and other operational games, MMO game players are more diverse. In addition to the battle power players who pursue the thrill of PK, there are also a large number of players who pursue social interaction, exploration, appearance and other gameplays. Therefore, tournaments cannot be an eye-catching method for all players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a battle power development game, the core method of improving battle power in MMO games is still氪金 (kèjīn - pay to win) and 肝 (gān - grinding), and relatively speaking, the player’s operation and skills have a relatively slight impact on the results. Therefore, for traditional MMO games, tournaments will not be used as the main means of attracting traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2Fde8c4aaa-8dda-4db4-8e61-1897245be3cd.jpg/size/" alt="NetEase MMO game &quot;Fantasy Westward Journey&quot; National PK Championship"></p>
<p>However, this does not mean that there is no place for tournaments in MMO games at all. In fact, there are still a considerable number of players who are willing to watch the “fairies fight” of various masters in the game. And in recent years, watching live broadcasts has become more and more a trend. For most players, they can satisfy their desire to “experience” the fun of master players through live broadcasts of tournaments. In addition, they can also learn the operation techniques and detail control of master players in tournaments.</p>
<p>Taking <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile (倩女幽魂手游 - Qiànnǚ Yōuhún Shǒuyóu)</em> as an example, a variety of tournament types have been launched, including the “Cross-Server Star Tournament” series specially created for big R players and the “National Championship” where all players compete fairly and test the players’ details and operations more.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2Faa10fe4a-cd90-460e-9635-eeb9fedd0011.jpg/size/" alt="A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Cross-Server Star Tournament"></p>
<p>For the “Cross-Server Star Tournament”, stricter restrictions are imposed on the registration conditions: only players with VIP level 18 or above can form a team to register. But this also ensures the luxurious level of the contestants’ equipment and improves the watchability of the tournament.</p>
<p>Compared with the “Cross-Server Star Tournament” where money is king, the “National Championship” pays more attention to the players’ control of details and the level of operation. The “National Championship” has almost no entry restrictions. All registered players can create accounts according to their profession on the exclusive tournament server, and all created accounts have the same level and equipment with the same or similar ratings for players to freely adjust and replace, and they can freely form teams to register. In the tournament, in addition to pursuing the ultimate equality, all accounts are equipped with “nuclear weapon-level” equipment, which can make players truly experience the top enjoyment of master players.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2F55b90b2c-9ec8-4601-aa02-ccfc3ca708fd.jpg/size/" alt="A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile National Championship"></p>
<p>In MMO game tournaments, if the participating teams win the top four, they will receive cash rewards of up to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan, as well as exclusive in-game props, titles and other rewards. Other players can interact by watching live broadcasts and participating in quizzes.</p>
<p>In addition, the finals of the “National Championship” are held offline together with the “A Chinese Ghost Story Carnival”. Players can purchase tickets in the game to meet the master players face-to-face, and players who cannot arrive at the scene can also watch the live broadcast in the game to cheer for their favorite teams.</p>

<p>Therefore, although tournaments are not a core means of attracting traffic for MMO games, through reasonable tournament settings and player interaction methods, they can still greatly enhance the player’s experience in the game.</p>
