<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191105/28584_846836.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, a game advertisement swept the country and became a popular online phrase:</p>
<p><em>“This is a brand new version you haven’t played before. Just experience it for three minutes, and you will be like me, loving this game…”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F1d61bc7f-a448-4b15-b38e-da21d27f115b.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was a successful brainwashing campaign. Many netizens imitated the accent of the spokesperson. Besides the popular catchphrase, there is one point worth pondering: Why would someone fall in love with this game after just 3 minutes of experience? What do players experience in these 3 minutes?</p>
<p>This is the topic of our discussion today: the core experience of a game.</p>
<p>The core experience carries the core fun of the game. Take <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em> (<em>New Ghost</em>) as an example, an MMO game that has been operating for 8 years. When many people talk about this game, they will mention social interaction. There are many players who like to make friends, find partners, decorate their homes, and chat in the game, rather than discussing PK skills.</p>
<p>So, is social interaction the core experience of <em>New Ghost</em>? No. At low levels, players are almost always playing solo, running through storylines and tasks. Guilds are something that come after level 25. Then is growth the core experience? No, either. Why do players want to grow? Ultimately, it is because they want to improve their strength so that they can defeat bosses and PK with other players, which is – combat. The reason why players continue to play is that the combat is exciting, defeating monsters is exciting, and “killing” is exciting.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F555dd04a-f8e1-467c-8c3e-0b02214c33fd.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>When we want to extract the core of a game, the simplest method is subtraction.</p>
<p><em>New Ghost</em> can be without the guild system, without the marriage system, and even without the chat box, but it cannot be without combat.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the core experience of <em>New Ghost</em> and <em>Honor of Kings</em> is the same: kill, defeat the opponent, and achieve combat victory.</p>
<p>In other words, the core experience must be repeatable and expandable. A player can repeatedly experience it from entering the game to leaving the game.</p>
<p>The core experience determines the type of game. Obviously, <em>Shining Nikki</em> and <em>Knives Out</em> are two different types of games. The former is a dress-up and nurturing game, while the latter is a tactical competition game. Different core experiences attract different types of players. In 2018, the average number of active users in the Chinese game market reached 280 million (MobData Research Institute, 2018). In the segmented market, MOBA and shooting games are evenly matched, and puzzle and parkour games also occupy a large market share.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F6873ff1d-4644-4e9a-a0a3-5e47e118bf0b.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>The most important thing for game developers at the beginning of game design is to determine the core experience of their game. This affects what kind of players will become the target players, whether they can accept the game, whether they are willing to try and continue to experience it, and it is also an important way to find a blue ocean.</p>
<p>A breakthrough and innovative core experience design can often help the game gain a leading position in the industry and reap unexpected rewards.</p>
<p>So, the core experience of the game is so important, what kind of support can we provide as user experience researchers?</p>
<p>If the game has not been officially launched or is still in a state of flux, congratulations, you are likely to find a way to success for the game at this time. For example, through concept testing, the product can understand what players are interested in and what they want at an early stage.</p>
<p>If the game has taken shape, a complete novice test can test the ease of getting started with the game and understand whether players can enjoy the core of the game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, there are thousands of methods. Grasping the core experience of the game is grasping the soul of the game.</p>
