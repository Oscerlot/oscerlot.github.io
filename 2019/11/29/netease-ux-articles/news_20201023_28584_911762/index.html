<p>A game community is an online community composed of a group of game-loving netizens who specifically discuss and interact with games and game-related content.</p>
<p>Similar to other online communities, game communities have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certain entry barriers:</strong> These game communities must be entered by players who have a certain understanding of the game and can accept specific interaction rules.</li>
<li><strong>Specific communication and interaction spaces:</strong> Unlike more comprehensive content platforms (such as Weibo and Tieba), these communities often have their own dedicated apps, forums, and other interaction spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Content production around specific themes:</strong> Game communities focus on games for content production and operation, and the content produced is highly specialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>For us game practitioners, the game community is a very important platform for game marketing and interaction with players, because it allows us to better understand the game content preferences and game experience ideas of higher-level players. In this series of studies, we will introduce several typical game communities and their differentiated user characteristics and service positioning characteristics.</p>
<p>First up: TapTap</p>
<p>TapTap is a game community and third-party game download application platform developed by ewan (Shanghai) Network Technology Co., Ltd. On this platform, users can easily discover games, purchase and install games, and can also publish game reviews and discuss games with other enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As a game community, TapTap has the following service features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clear access mechanism:</strong> By setting up an “Etiquette Exam” in the user registration process, TapTap clarifies a relatively clear user access mechanism - users need to understand and recognize certain community interaction rules, and master basic game common sense to enter the TapTap community.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F979984f7-6aa6-4041-b38d-28d73078cefb.jpg/size/" alt="TapTap Etiquette Exam Page"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emphasis on shaping the interactive atmosphere of community members:</strong> By setting up interactive review replies, likes, and thematic forums, TapTap emphasizes creating an atmosphere of communication between players and players, and between players and game developers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F8330793a-df1c-4640-a8ae-53d806c281c7.jpg/size/" alt="Game developers reply to player reviews on TapTap"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Featuring high-quality game review content:</strong> Compared with game reviews in mobile app stores, game reviews on TapTap are generally of higher quality. Even if players give a low-star rating, they will give detailed reasons. These quality-guaranteed game reviews provide game developers with many suggestions for game optimization.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Fa8cbd132-0d01-489e-95d9-674ac72edb16.jpg/size/" alt="Screenshots of the review pages of PUBG Mobile in Wandoujia and TapTap. It can be seen that the reviews given by TapTap are detailed and there are fewer emotional replies."></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are the service features of TapTap as a professional game community.</p>
<p><strong>User Portrait</strong></p>
<p>Some people may ask, what are the characteristics of TapTap users? Do they have preferences for specific game categories and gameplay? By querying Baidu Index (time window: September 29, 2019 - October 28, 2019) and referring to other industry reports, we have obtained the following TapTap user portrait information:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>User gender distribution:</strong> TapTap has significantly more male users than female users.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Ff356340b-3414-451c-96ad-563bc76d587e.jpg/size/" alt="User gender distribution"></p>
<p>(2) <strong>User age distribution:</strong> Among TapTap users, users aged 24 and below account for 78.6%.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F22e0c0c6-a271-4cbb-9452-ccbfaaff7f52.jpg/size/" alt="User age distribution"></p>
<p>(3) <strong>User geographical distribution:</strong> Mostly distributed in coastal areas, but also covers some central and western provinces. If calculated according to the frequency of users searching for TapTap in various places, users in coastal provinces (such as Guangdong and Jiangsu) rank higher, but it can be seen that the search popularity of TapTap is higher in some central and western provinces (such as Henan, Sichuan, Hubei, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F7d1353df-27d7-478d-b29d-acaa1b59d9d6.jpg/size/" alt="User geographical distribution"></p>
<p>(4) <strong>User game preference:</strong> Relatively prefer independent games. Compared with popular game categories, users have higher evaluations of games with innovative gameplay. Based on a study of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list in the first half of 2019 conducted by 36Kr website in May 2019, we can find that most of the games with good reputation (rating 8.0 and above) on TapTap are independent games, including independent studios and independent projects released by major manufacturers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Fa0ff8bf7-52c9-4f7c-9e7a-c14757375a74.jpg/size/" alt="TapTap&#39;s Top 12 Games by Reputation, from which it can be seen that most of them are produced by independent studios"></p>
<p>Based on this list, we can also find the following trends: popular categories in the mobile game market, such as MOBA, MMO, and battle royale, have been somewhat snubbed on the TapTap platform due to the large number of similar competing products and the convergence of gameplay. Games in categories such as puzzle, story, casual, and hardcore action are more likely to be praised by TapTap users because their audience is relatively small and there is more room for gameplay innovation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F8a915329-9625-4825-a48e-d18ea729bb2f.jpg/size/" alt="Category distribution of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list. It can be seen that casual puzzle, text story and other categories account for a relatively high proportion."></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F75c1b21a-cf87-4975-a0b7-72b06eaa3406.jpg/size/" alt="The above picture is a word cloud map based on the tags of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list. It can be seen that tags such as single-player, casual, puzzle, and intellectual appear more frequently."></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>From the above analysis, we make the following summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>TapTap as a game community: has certain entry barriers, is highly specialized, and maintains a relatively neutral image among players and game manufacturers;</li>
<li>As a member of such a game community: young, with rich game experience, and relatively niche game preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>So do other game communities have similar user and service characteristics to TapTap?</p>
