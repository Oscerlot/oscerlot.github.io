<p>The game user interface is the space where the user interacts with the machine.</p>
<p>The game user interface not only includes the GUI (graphical user interface) on the screen, but also includes touch controls on mobile phones, for instance - all controls that interact with the user in one or more ways. This is what we call interaction.</p>
<p>In the following text, we will discuss a lot about the graphical interface, but please keep in mind that it is part of a larger scope: the GUI is always affected by the interaction method, and it also affects the interaction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-Designing-UI-is-About-Space-and-White-Space"><a href="#1-Designing-UI-is-About-Space-and-White-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Designing UI is About Space and White Space"></a>1. Designing UI is About Space and White Space</h2><p>Controls bring structure, hierarchy, and clarity, giving the GUI a sense of breathing room.</p>
<p>The main task of design is to deal with screen space: when and where should players master what information on the interface?</p>
<p>We can use two design methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully add the information you think is necessary on the interface until the interface is almost arranged.</li>
<li>Put all the information you think may need to be placed on the interface, and then remove some information you think is not important until the white space of the interface reaches a comfortable value, and leaves enough important information for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Space is not just the blank part between two main elements, but also includes the white space between letters, the pixels between images… When it comes to space, everything is important.</p>
<p>Which of the above two design methods is used depends on the project, intention, and designer. When designing, keep an open mind and try new methods. (One note: Due to the prevalence of minimalism, many UI designers are now starting to work in this direction, but over-focusing on minimalism may lead to a lack of important game information. Minimalism is not as easy as it seems. In many cases, planners want to express a lot of information. Minimalism is not about deleting information, but about presenting more information with less content, which increases the requirements for designers.)</p>

<h2 id="2-Art-Style-and-Immersion"><a href="#2-Art-Style-and-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="2. Art Style and Immersion"></a>2. Art Style and Immersion</h2><p>The UI style being consistent with the game’s art direction will greatly enhance the overall immersion of the game. However, if you don’t have enough resources or ability, please don’t try to make a very special GUI to fit your art style. Designing a mature flat UI is better than a strange “I think this GUI is very suitable for my art style”.</p>
<p>Flat design is like “black”, it is easy to get results.</p>

<h2 id="3-Form-Follows-Function"><a href="#3-Form-Follows-Function" class="headerlink" title="3. Form Follows Function"></a>3. Form Follows Function</h2><p>When designing, consider using color, shape, and other attributes to illustrate how to use elements. This design method is called “affordances”.</p>
<p><strong>1. Shape</strong></p>
<p>The shape, color, and size of UI elements really illustrate their position and purpose here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F0c7cf2b5-4bc9-4aa7-b592-14771b5a2cc9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;0c7cf2b5-4bc9-4aa7-b592-14771b5a2cc9.jpg"></p>
<p>As shown above, the shadow of each button provides a lot of information to the user. The light comes from the top, and the shadow will cause depth and possible movement when pressed.</p>
<p><strong>2. Size</strong></p>
<p>We can use “Fitts’s Law” to scale the button to a degree proportional to its use.</p>
<p>But making information&#x2F;space huge is not the solution to everything. Too large is often ugly and feels inappropriate. Aesthetics are also very important. The more beautiful the appearance, the more it can bring players satisfaction and pleasure. We believe that this will also affect key performance indicators.</p>
<p>The proportion between elements is also very important. The following figure is a design sketch of a binary options game. The proportion of its interface elements is very poorly designed, which is why its bottom button appears completely unsuitable for the interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2Fee3a6501-d233-4df2-b528-3f517318fca8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;ee3a6501-d233-4df2-b528-3f517318fca8.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>3. Color</strong></p>
<p>Compared to shape, color should better illustrate “what this space should do”. You can ask yourself, what do you want to convey to the player with this control, is it good or bad? This should influence your color choices.</p>
<p>Color also depends on culture. For example, in foreign countries, red will be used for health-related content, as well as negative, warning, and feedback. But in China, red is mostly a very positive color, which means good luck and joy.</p>
<p>When designing international games, you need to consider this, but we don’t need to be too careful. In a globalized environment, the meaning of color is not so clearly demarcated. For example, many games in China now also use red as a warning, such as a strong red feedback when the health is low. The influence of culture on color will only slightly affect some special feedback and UI elements.</p>
<p>In addition, when designing, we should try to design in black and white as much as possible. This is a good technique to help you quickly obtain prominent information and identify key issues. In addition, about 10% of people can only see a limited range of colors, so we should also pay attention to how to match colors so that these people will not be confused because they cannot see the color difference.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-Consistency"><a href="#4-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="4. Consistency"></a>4. Consistency</h2><p>The UI needs to be consistent with player operating behavior, and so do color and space.</p>
<p>This is a rule of thumb to help you easily know how many colors should be in the UI palette:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F2c8d9d3e-1516-41bc-90a8-0a5b74d09e05.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;2c8d9d3e-1516-41bc-90a8-0a5b74d09e05.jpg"></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a dark&#x2F;black and a slightly lighter color</li>
<li>Choose a bright&#x2F;white and a slightly darker color</li>
<li>Choose a red color as a warning and negative feedback color</li>
<li>Choose green as the verification and positive feedback color</li>
<li>You can choose another “key” color as the color of all other content. This color needs to be neutral and not particularly positive or negative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, you can choose more or fewer colors according to the specific situation of the project. Choosing the right color is another matter. Trying to make the colors match well is also important.</p>
<p>If you need to use the same color to make changes, I suggest you only change the “saturation” and “brightness” of the color, as shown above.</p>
<p>We also need to pay attention to the number of fonts and font sizes used. We will only add fonts or sizes when it makes sense, and combine them with the creation of interactive levels for a purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-Usability-Efficiency-and-Satisfaction"><a href="#5-Usability-Efficiency-and-Satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="5. Usability, Efficiency and Satisfaction"></a>5. Usability, Efficiency and Satisfaction</h2><p>The player is never wrong.</p>
<p>Repeat, the player is never wrong.</p>
<p>If someone misuses your design, it means that your design is misleading, and the problem lies with the designer. Users don’t really misuse it, they just use it according to what they think is the correct understanding.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t meet everyone’s needs, so we need to focus more on the core audience. Sometimes making a tutorial can greatly help us improve usability.</p>
<p>In general, this is a very ideal point of view, and we should always strive for an experience without explanation and friction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-The-Art-of-Animation"><a href="#6-The-Art-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="6. The Art of Animation"></a>6. The Art of Animation</h2><p>Movement should be natural.</p>
<p>Animation is a bonus item for the interface, which can make our design change from “very good” to “wow”. Slight animation transitions can convey a lot of information and feelings in a very intuitive way.</p>
<p>It can also help the player’s brain transition from one state to another, and make the whole experience smoother. We believe that the best animation is one that players are not aware of, but is still useful to them.</p>
<p>Just like level design: the best designers are invisible, and players are unaware.</p>
<p>Sadly, this makes it very difficult to test animations and truly define whether they are correct.</p>
<p>The movement should last between 200 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds. Any animation over 500 milliseconds may be felt to be too slow.</p>
<p>Below we use Robert Penner’s easing animation example to explore the real skills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F7b4781e6-8c16-4a32-8679-886617bc1ed0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;7b4781e6-8c16-4a32-8679-886617bc1ed0.jpg"></p>
<p>Most of the time, we will want to use cubic motion to make the animation feel natural. Depending on the game world, we will generally use “elastic”, “bounce” or “back” to get a cartoon-like feeling.</p>
<p>(Another indication about motion: elements moving within the screen range should accelerate and decelerate, elements moving out of the screen should only accelerate, and elements entering the screen should only decelerate.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-Frictionless"><a href="#7-Frictionless" class="headerlink" title="7. Frictionless"></a>7. Frictionless</h2><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F081c62df-88c3-49bb-a315-01297fb8fe4a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;081c62df-88c3-49bb-a315-01297fb8fe4a.jpg"></p>
<p>Google’s undo button, designed with user fault tolerance in mind.</p>
<p>All of the above can be summarized in one word: frictionless - the user interface should provide players with the information they need at the right time and allow them to control it in the way they like.</p>
<p>This is largely ideological, but perhaps an AI-driven future can better achieve this. For now, our design goal is “fewer errors”. We can’t make a completely correct UI interface, which contains too many factors.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, UI design will be designed according to its purpose and according to what the player’s brain is familiar with.</p>
