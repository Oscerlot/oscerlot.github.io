<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Game producer Jenova Chen mentioned in his GDC talk about <em>Journey</em> (the designer of <em>Journey</em> sharing the team’s process of developing the game) that movies are already very mature and have precipitated different emotions, but the sense of achievement provided by most games cannot be provided by movies. Only the feedback obtained after one’s own efforts will give you a sense of achievement. This feeling can only be achieved through interactive experience. Perhaps because of this, this is also the most explored emotional direction in games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2F034f4c58-4bda-4509-8439-0f70da5c3bf9.jpg/size/" alt="Journey"></p>
<h2 id="Goals-in-Games"><a href="#Goals-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Goals in Games"></a>Goals in Games</h2><p>The charm of games, or the reason why they attract players and make them unable to stop, is precisely this. There are many goals in games that can satisfy people with different needs. Those who like collecting have full collection achievements, and those who like cultivation have various cultivation elements. In the game, players are always in a state of striving to achieve a certain goal, from completing single-game goals to phased milestone goals, and then to completing the ultimate goal. In this way, players feel that they have something to do, and experience a strong sense of participation and immersion in the process of doing things. When the goal is completed, there is also a strong sense of achievement.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2F15e52019-7bd6-4791-be91-dd5feda53103.jpg/size/" alt="Game Goals"></p>
<p>During design, player goals and design goals can be achieved simultaneously. “Visible progress” in the game is a very important advantage compared to various learning and exercise goals in real life. Many times in real life, when we learn a piece of knowledge or a skill, we practice for a long time without seeing “visible” progress, and we even don’t know whether we are practicing in the right direction. But in the game, we can clearly see the “experience increase”, “current progress”, etc., so that we have more motivation to continue.</p>
<h2 id="User’s-Sense-of-Control"><a href="#User’s-Sense-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="User’s Sense of Control"></a>User’s Sense of Control</h2><p>Sense of control is a person’s belief in their ability to control the surrounding environment. In the context of user experience design, sense of control can be used to describe the user’s confidence or frustration in using the product, and can also be used to describe the usability of the product itself. If users have a high sense of control when using the product or completing tasks, their attitude will be more positive, they will be more willing to accept setbacks and make mistakes, and they will also have a greater sense of security. In the process of experience design, we should ensure the user’s sense of control to enhance the user’s participation and willingness to explore.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2Fcf4bb8be-15f8-4703-9ec0-0087fe3d3ded.jpg/size/" alt="Sense of Control"></p>
<p>Especially for racing games, you can experience a higher need for control - bypassing different corners, flying out, and most importantly, grasping your own direction, otherwise you will lose control. The sense of control and challenge it possesses is very fascinating. This fascination is very easy to enter a “flow state”, which is also the effect that game designers hope to achieve.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback-and-Satisfaction"><a href="#Feedback-and-Satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="Feedback and Satisfaction"></a>Feedback and Satisfaction</h2><p>When skills are improved or levels are raised, there is a certain sense of proficiency. At this time, players should have a feeling of encouragement. This kind of positive and rapid encouragement helps users form a positive attitude towards the use process. For example, when you are playing a game, the initial operational requirements make you feel a little uncomfortable, such as selecting minions and switching between heroes’ attacks. But when your level improves, you can easily control your operations, and the operation effects are fed back in real time, quickly informing you of the results, to obtain great satisfaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2Fc4356b53-5f6a-47ac-adba-d250510c1949.jpg/size/" alt="Feedback"></p>
<p>The game feedback system clearly tells players the current situation and shows how far they are from achieving their goals. It is reflected in the form of points, levels, scores, progress bars, equipment backpacks, etc. The feedback system is the most basic and simplest form. For players, real-time feedback is a promise: the goal can definitely be achieved, which gives people confidence to continue playing.</p>
<h2 id="Coda"><a href="#Coda" class="headerlink" title="Coda"></a>Coda</h2><p>Games make players feel happy. We must constantly create happy things in the game to satisfy players’ corrections to real-life dissatisfaction. Players will have a good impression of such games, and their psychology will be satisfied.</p>
