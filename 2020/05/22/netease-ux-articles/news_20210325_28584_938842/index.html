<p>Why does entering UNO feel like entering a black hole of happy time? Fun is a very complex word, with more dimensions than pleasure. There are many theories that explain the fun of games. Today, we will start with two perspectives: reinforcement theory and flow theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20200427%2Ff6b43234-81e2-4014-89bb-f9173c2e30a5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20200427&#x2F;f6b43234-81e2-4014-89bb-f9173c2e30a5.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="Reinforcement-Theory-Skinner’s-Reinforcement-Theory"><a href="#Reinforcement-Theory-Skinner’s-Reinforcement-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Reinforcement Theory (Skinner’s Reinforcement Theory)"></a>Reinforcement Theory (Skinner’s Reinforcement Theory)</h2><p>Reinforcement theory was proposed by Skinner, also known as the operant conditioning theory. Positive reinforcement is more commonly used in games. Positive reinforcement, also known as positive reinforcement, simply means that by adding a certain stimulus, the probability of a certain behavior increases. For example, Xiao You completes her homework on time every day and gets 30 minutes of UNO time. In order to get 30 minutes of UNO time, Xiao You completes her homework on time every day. Thus, a connection is established: completing homework on time will be rewarded, and the reward brings happiness.</p>

<hr>
<p>So how is reinforcement theory applied to games? By rationally utilizing the reinforcement formula, linking rewards to certain behaviors, and increasing the individual’s sense of gain and achievement, players can experience more fun.</p>
<p>Application of reinforcement theory: In the game “UNO!”, winning a game will earn coins. This is a kind of positive reinforcement. I win, I can get rewards, and thus get more satisfaction. Moreover, in order to expand the impact of this positive reinforcement, very rich special effects are usually used. This feeling of coins flying all over the sky, doesn’t it give a great sense of gain and achievement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Faac3aec2-1885-4008-961b-f08b95327e61.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;aac3aec2-1885-4008-961b-f08b95327e61.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players win a lot of coins in the high-stakes arena of “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Reinforcement theory is more biased towards the behavioral level. Players are reinforced by this, feel happy, and will invest more frequently in the game. But players don’t always win. Sometimes, due to the increased difficulty of the game, they will lose ten times in a row or be punished with 16 cards. So why are players still enjoying it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Fbb5b3387-f095-454d-b4f3-af3c4c5078be.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;bb5b3387-f095-454d-b4f3-af3c4c5078be.png"></p>

<h2 id="Flow-Theory-Mental-Flow"><a href="#Flow-Theory-Mental-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Flow Theory (Mental Flow)"></a>Flow Theory (Mental Flow)</h2><p>Flow theory was proposed by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He defined flow as a feeling of complete focus of one’s mental energy on a certain activity; when flow occurs, there is also a high degree of excitement and fulfillment. The generation of flow needs to consider five dimensions: challenge and skill, anxiety and boredom, and difficulty balance. In the figure below, A is our player. He will have different states due to the level of challenge difficulty and his own ability level. For example, if a high-difficulty challenge is matched with a low skill level, the player will be very anxious; if a low-difficulty challenge is matched with a high skill level, the player will be very bored. Only when the appropriate difficulty challenge is matched with the appropriate skill level will the player be in a state of flow.</p>

<p><em>Flow Channel (from Jesse Schell’s “The Art of Game Design”)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of game design is to adjust the appropriate difficulty so that players are always in a state of flow and get a very satisfying feeling. In the figure below, players reach the first stage (world1) with only a relatively low skill level, while reaching the last stage requires a very high skill level. This stage is the player’s growth process. In games, for example, in the “UNO!” novice tutorial, various gameplays are opened in sequence. Players need to learn how to play the classic mode first, and only after upgrading to level xx will other gameplays such as competitive events be unlocked. This kind of teaching conforms to the growth process of flow and is more likely to make players feel excited and satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study of Applying Flow Theory: “UNO!” Ranked Mode</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F84664d95-dc6a-4bd3-ab4a-ab67db15f6de.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;84664d95-dc6a-4bd3-ab4a-ab67db15f6de.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ranked Mode in “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the current ranked match of “UNO!”, players can be matched with players one level above or below their own rank. In other words, players will always be matched with players of similar skill levels, so players are always challenging “appropriate difficulty” and are more likely to be in a state of flow. So why do players still want to continue playing even if they lose? From the perspective of flow, the flow state that players have experienced before gives them a foundation of skills and a psychological state of satisfaction and confidence, and they are more convinced that they can challenge this difficulty. Think about it, if you lose a ranked match, you always feel that “my skills should be fine, I was just unlucky, I will definitely win the next one.”</p>

<p>The fun of games is still a relatively complex topic. In addition to reinforcement theory and flow theory, some scholars explain the fun of games from the perspective of evolutionary psychology and behavioral economics. So here’s a small question for everyone to think about. Why do people especially like to participate in game competitions?</p>
