</blockquote>
<p>As an <em>UNO!</em> enthusiast, I often claim that “I’m addicted to playing UNO!”, but why am I addicted? Where does the “addiction” come from? In fact, it can be explained by a very specific model, namely the famous “Hook Model”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F3c74d161-4c35-4722-97c4-70ea3fb2506c.png/size/" alt="Hook Model"></p>
<p>The Hook Model was proposed by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover, authors of <em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em>. They attribute addiction to “behaviors done with little or no conscious thought.” And how to become “addicted” requires the four product elements of the Hook Model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong></li>
<li><strong>Action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Variable Reward</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Trigger"><a href="#Trigger" class="headerlink" title="Trigger"></a>Trigger</h3><p>“Trigger” is the first step of the Hook Model. If this step cannot arouse the user’s interest, the follow-up is out of the question. There are two forms of triggers: “external triggers” and “internal triggers”.</p>
<p>External triggers are external information that induces users to take action and enter the system. The external triggers after the launch of <em>UNO!</em> include: recommendations from app stores (including TapTap), information pushes on platforms such as Weibo and WeChat official accounts, and friend invitations among UNO players. It is worth mentioning that KOL (Key Opinion Leader) promotion is also an extremely effective external trigger. Many <em>UNO!</em> players said that they were hooked after watching the live broadcast of the famous up-host “Xiaoyao Sanren”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F2a352ee0-29f8-4dea-b82e-f89b6126bfc7.png/size/" alt="Xiaoyao Sanren&#39;s video"></p>
<p>Internal triggers are user self-directed triggers driven by their own emotions. Studies have shown that negative emotions, such as loneliness, fear, frustration, and confusion, can even affect our behavior more than positive emotions. The initial launch of <em>UNO!</em> coincided with the period of domestic epidemic, many users were isolated at home and felt bored and lonely, eager to communicate with others, and were very likely to get into new games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F9225403a-9464-435e-a35f-68465463fd74.png/size/" alt="The psychological journey before and after playing UNO"></p>
<h3 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h3><p>After the trigger, it is to make the user take action. The Hook Model is built on the Behavior Model of Stanford professor Bijou, that is, behavior &#x3D; motivation + ability + trigger. In life, no matter what we do, we have various motivations, and <em>UNO!</em> satisfies the following needs of users in terms of motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sociality</strong>: The two-player mode and room mode with limited free room cards in <em>UNO!</em> allow players to play with friends, especially former board game players, who can experience UNO cards online.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of Achievement</strong>: The ranking system, World Cup, various leaderboards, and rankings among friends can stimulate players to continuously challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Ability</strong>: that is, the user’s ability to complete the desired action. In terms of ability, the threshold of <em>UNO!</em> is low, and the low cost of user input makes it easy to get started:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Ffb139808-150d-4bbf-9e3f-bb1540fa113e.png/size/" alt="Three-minute time limit"></p>
<ol>
<li>The game time is short, basically 3 minutes per round.</li>
<li>The operation mode is simple, which is to draw cards and play cards, and occasionally there will be functional card options such as challenges and stacking.</li>
<li>The game rules are simple, and there are only two situations to win: play all the cards or have the lowest score when the time is up.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a sufficiently low threshold, the addition of the ranking system and custom rooms allows players of the same level to match each other, retaining high-level players.</p>
<h3 id="Variable-Reward"><a href="#Variable-Reward" class="headerlink" title="Variable Reward"></a>Variable Reward</h3><p>After the behavior is triggered, it is necessary to give users some rewards for continuous stimulation in order to cultivate their usage habits. But rewards alone are not enough, and Variable Rewards can make users truly “addicted”. Behavioral research shows that people’s satisfaction with products will gradually decrease over time. Maintaining variability can ensure the mystery and attractiveness of products, and maintain users’ long-term interest, which is also the reason why all games need to be updated regularly. The rewards in the Hook Model include three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Rewards</strong>: That is, cooperation and competition, sense of identity, and interpersonal rewards generated by interacting with others. The two-player mode of <em>UNO!</em> can freely match unfamiliar teammates. In the game, you can give flowers and rotten eggs to your teammates. “Not knowing what kind of teammates you will encounter” is an unknown expectation. The daily exchange of gold coins between game friends, the leaderboard, and the ability to open a room to customize the rules of the game, all give players the motivation to participate in cooperation and competition in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Fb17410b4-5206-487d-9ab9-019e104bb67d.png/size/" alt="Can match with strangers to become teammates"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunt Rewards</strong>: That is, the specific resources or exclusive information obtained. <em>UNO!</em> has high-multiplier mode such as 40x and 80x. Once you win, you can get a lot of money. This kind of high-intensity reward stimulation will give players the desire to continuously challenge. In fact, all gold coins and prop rewards in the game belong to the category of hunt rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F3e5f65c7-891e-489e-a715-213967654b9d.png/size/" alt="High-multiplier rounds can get more gold coins"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self Rewards</strong>: That is, the sense of control, achievement, and other self-emotional rewards experienced from the product. <em>UNO!</em> has set different ranks, and self-recognition can be obtained through promotion. The World Cup “representing China” also gives players a sense of honor and achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F9b63bcf8-5228-4663-af96-2be7dfb9fc50.png/size/" alt="There are big differences between ranks"></p>
<h3 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h3><p>Psychological research shows that the time and energy a user invests in something is directly proportional to the degree of dependence, just like you won’t cherish free things, but you will recharge more and more in paid games. Therefore, the last step of “addiction” is to invest.</p>
<p>The simplest investment is time and money. When a person has played 200 rounds of UNO or recharged 200 yuan of gold coins, no matter how many gold coins he has left or whether he is bankrupt, he will want to get more or even multiple times more gold coins, and will further invest in the game.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <em>UNO!</em> is a game with a low entry barrier, but it is not easy to become a master. It requires a process of learning and continuous practice, which is also an investment in self-improvement. When you become a master of a game, it will be more difficult for you to leave the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F4c502198-d6e6-49ec-ba9a-29e7bce893ea.png/size/" alt="Masters are &quot;on the list&quot;"></p>
<p>In addition, the accumulated appearance and ranking in the game are also an investment in “content” and “data”.</p>
