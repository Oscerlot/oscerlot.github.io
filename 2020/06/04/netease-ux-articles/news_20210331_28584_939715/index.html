<p>Recently, the street vendor economy has become very popular. While surfing the internet, I found that everyone is setting up stalls, and there is a lively atmosphere everywhere. As a game developer, I am not to be outdone. I want to discuss with everyone how to use the experience of making games to become the king of street vendors, and introduce how consumer psychology effects can be applied from games to street vending. This sharing uses the official UNO mobile game <em>UNO!™</em> as a case study.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F413937a6-5608-47f0-a820-2c4ca2c6b044.png/size/" alt="UNO!™ Dev Team Setting Up a Stall"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Anchoring-Effect"><a href="#Anchoring-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Anchoring Effect"></a>Anchoring Effect</h2><p>The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for individuals to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the “anchor”) when making estimates or decisions, even if that information is irrelevant. When making decisions, people unconsciously give too much weight to the information they first obtain. For example, when a salesperson wants to visit a customer, they will specifically propose a time to visit, such as “Are you free at two o’clock on Saturday?” If the customer is not available, they will generally look for another suitable time based on this time, rather than setting aside the “two o’clock on Saturday” time anchor and expressing that they do not need to meet the salesperson.</p>
<p>In the <em>UNO!™</em> game, you will see some discounted items. Discounted items are often marked with the original price and the discounted price. Since the discounted price already provides the information, why mark the original price? The original price is the “anchor”, which affects your estimated value of this item. When you estimate the value of this item to be 10 diamonds, but now you can buy it for 8 diamonds or even 5 diamonds, wouldn’t you think “it’s a steal, buy!”</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F907ec0cc-a290-452c-92c9-7d2821ce20e7.png/size/" alt="Important UNO!™ Item, Shields, Are Sometimes Sold at a Discount"></p>
<p>Then when we go to set up a street stall, we can use this experience. Whether we want to sell clothes or snacks, don’t forget to give customers an “anchor” first, quietly lock the value of the goods, and then give customers a discount, so that customers have a feeling of “getting a bargain”. Of course, it should also be noted that if this “anchor” deviates too far from the value of the goods, it will not be effective.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F3b9ad5a3-3635-44c7-a262-e2e7d04e67a1.png/size/" alt="An Exaggerated Anchor Will Make Customers Feel It&#39;s Too Exaggerated"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Reciprocity-Principle"><a href="#Reciprocity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Reciprocity Principle"></a>Reciprocity Principle</h2><p>The reciprocity principle suggests that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. In summary, it is a behavior that should be reciprocated with a similar behavior. For example, on your birthday, someone gave you a birthday present. Then you must be thinking about giving him a birthday present on his birthday, or giving him some gifts at other suitable times.</p>
<p>In the <em>UNO!™</em> game, players can give each other coins. If a friend gives you ten coins, then you must be thinking about giving them back. If your daily coin gifting limit is used up, and you play a game with him, you may also want to give him a small gift in the game to give back.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fbb10463b-2d65-491d-b3da-e4dcec9578c1.png/size/" alt="Players Can Give and Receive Coins from Friends in the Social Function"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F359f78ae-df76-4bfe-8578-c023fe65ca36.png/size/" alt="Players Can Give Gifts to Each Other in Matches"></p>
<p>So how can the reciprocity principle be applied to street vending? Suppose we go to set up a stall to sell fruit and occupy a high-traffic area of the street. We pull in passers-by for free tastings. People who have eaten the fruit will want to reciprocate with some behavior, and may choose to buy some fruit, or of course they may say thank you. Stalls selling clothes don’t have tastings, but don’t worry, put two buckets of low-cost flowers at the door, and give one to everyone who passes by. Someone holding a flower will always want to give back to you, and by the way, take a look at the clothes and buy some clothes.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fe94873fd-caad-4d79-9ce9-a35174172171.png/size/" alt="Reciprocity Between Merchants and Customers"></p>
<p>I have to say, psychology is really everywhere in daily life and games. Using game experience to become the king of street vendors, we game people never give up. Leave a small question, what is going on with the queuing to enter the server in the game and the “shills” at the entrance of the milk tea shop?</p>
