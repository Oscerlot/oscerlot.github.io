<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The direction of escalators in shopping malls is always consistent. It will not be the case that the escalator on the first floor is up on the left and down on the right, while on the second floor it is up on the right and down on the left.</p>
<p>Imagine how much inconvenience it would cause people if the escalators going up from the first floor to the fourth floor were all on the left, while the one on the fifth floor was on the right?</p>
<p>This reflects the consistency principle.</p>
<h2 id="The-Consistency-Principle-and-Its-Importance"><a href="#The-Consistency-Principle-and-Its-Importance" class="headerlink" title="The Consistency Principle and Its Importance"></a>The Consistency Principle and Its Importance</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Consistency Principle?"></a>1. What is the Consistency Principle?</h3><p>Within the same product, the navigation methods, naming methods for the same functions, visual presentation of similar elements, and interaction rules for operational behaviors should be consistent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the product should also be consistent with common industry standards.</p>
<p>The consistency principle is ubiquitous in life and is also widely used in the field of game design.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Importance-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#2-The-Importance-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="2. The Importance of the Consistency Principle"></a>2. The Importance of the Consistency Principle</h3><p>For players, the consistency of interfaces and functions can greatly reduce the learning cost for players.</p>
<p>When players are familiar with the basic operations, they can quickly learn other systems and gameplay, reducing the sense of interruption for players in the game, thereby improving the player’s operational efficiency.</p>
<p>There are many games where we can “blindly operate” after our operational proficiency improves, and even form muscle memory, allowing us to enjoy the exciting battles in the game.</p>
<p>For developers, the consistency of the interface allows many art resources to be reused.</p>
<p>For example, the consistent style of buttons in the game allows designers to quickly reuse them without having to redesign them for each interface.</p>
<p>The same is true for programmers. The same functions can also be directly reused, reducing development costs.</p>
<p>In addition, consistency can help the game maintain a consistent style and form the game’s unique style and impression.</p>
<p>Moreover, for newcomers, they can quickly get started with the project according to development or design specifications, reducing learning costs.</p>
<p>The consistency principle is reflected in many aspects of design.</p>
<p>This article mainly divides it into four parts for introduction: visual consistency, text consistency, functional consistency, and special effects consistency.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Application of the Consistency Principle"></a>Application of the Consistency Principle</h2><h3 id="1-Visual-Consistency"><a href="#1-Visual-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="1. Visual Consistency"></a>1. Visual Consistency</h3><p>Visual consistency is mainly reflected in the consistency of visual style and visual elements.</p>
<p>Here’s a concise example:</p>
<p>The following two games have a strong difference in visual style.</p>
<p>The cold gray atmosphere of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> is embellished with bright red, rendering a strong sense of war epic and history.</p>
<p>The high-purity colors of <em>UNO!</em> are cheerful, lively, and bright.</p>
<p>Each game has its own unique visual style, and when designing, it is also necessary to comply with the style attributes of the project itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F1f620338-692b-459a-a11f-38b2781f6193.png/size/" alt="UNO Screenshot"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different games have different visual styles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consistency also needs to be considered in the details of visual presentation.</p>
<p>For example, we often use red and blue colors in games to represent conflicting sides.</p>
<p>Sometimes blue represents the friendly side and red represents the enemy side; sometimes blue represents defense and red represents attack.</p>
<p>In the design of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, there is a gameplay where two sides duel in the world, and other players can also join the battle. When joining, they need to choose a faction.</p>
<p>At this time, it is natural to think of using the red and blue colors of the duel to represent the two factions in the battle.</p>
<p>So the question is, what should the semantics of red and blue be?</p>
<p>The simplest solution is that red represents attack, but is it really appropriate?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F54ae6e08-a74a-44b6-bbc7-224b7d9b7635.png/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade World Pursuit Battle Interface"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> World Pursuit Battle participation interface, red and blue represent enemy and friend, not attack and defense</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this problem, after re-examining the game, it was found that in the core battles of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, red and blue always represent the friendly side and the enemy side, and have nothing to do with attack and defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was finally decided to maintain the consistency of color semantics, with blue representing the friendly side and red representing the enemy side.</p>
<p>So how do you determine the enemy and friend?</p>
<p>We have specially designed a set of calculation methods, which compare the initiator of the two sides of the battle with the player based on elements such as family relationships.</p>
<p>The relatively friendly side is placed on the left as the blue side, and the other side is on the right.</p>
<p>If the degree of friendship is the same, the blue side on the left is the defending side. After all, the pursued side should be more protected and supported.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F2b5a5372-01e4-4393-b5d6-017a9f029139.jpg/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade Screenshot"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In game design, it is necessary to maintain the consistency of color semantics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the font size, spacing, and positional relationship of the text in the game also need to be consistent.</p>
<p>We often set several font sizes for the game at the beginning of the design, which are used for titles, subtitles, and body text, respectively.</p>
<p>In most cases, the default font size and spacing will be used to ensure visual consistency, making it easier for players to quickly locate the information they want to know.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2Fc3d8eac5-4f29-44c5-903f-12d9303c17a9.png/size/" alt="Font Example"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Font size, spacing, and positional relationships need to be consistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the size relationship of elements also needs to be consistent.</p>
<p>This is mainly reflected in the use of icons and some materials in the game.</p>
<p>For example, at the beginning of the design, the size and style of the “unit cards” of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> lacked consistency. The position and proportion of the characters in the cards were different, and other elements were not kept in the same position and relative size.</p>
<p>After the later optimization, the size of the cards was clustered, and the overall visual feeling was more consistent, making it easier for players to form image memory and improve the player experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F2e7e1b9c-4012-4378-964a-58f63f36ede4.png/size/" alt="Inconsistent Unit Card Example"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F92a67966-b8c1-42ef-b518-a5e5b09c4245.png/size/" alt="Consistent Unit Card Example"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> “unit card” iteration, element consistency optimization</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-Text-Consistency"><a href="#2-Text-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Text Consistency"></a>2. Text Consistency</h3><p>The style and semantic expression of the text also need to be consistent.</p>
<p>For example, the feedback pop-up window for errors should use the same language and structure when describing the same thing, otherwise it will cause players to pay higher reading comprehension costs.</p>
<p>For example, the text on the confirmation button cannot be called “OK” at one time, “Confirm” at another time, and “Got it” at another time, otherwise the player will have to react to the meaning of the button every time, causing a pause in the experience.</p>
<p>This unnecessary burden and pause are very unnecessary.</p>
<p>However, because this kind of pop-up window is spread all over the game, omissions and occasional inconsistencies often occur. More care and attention must be paid during the design.</p>
