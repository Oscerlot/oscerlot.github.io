<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Within the same product, the navigation methods, the naming of identical functions, the visual presentation of similar elements, and the interaction principles of operational behaviors should maintain consistency.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the product should also maintain consistency with common industry standards.</p>
<p>This is the Consistency Principle.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Application of the Consistency Principle"></a>Application of the Consistency Principle</h2><p>The Consistency Principle is ubiquitous in daily life and is also widely applied in the field of game design.</p>
<p>This article mainly divides it into four parts for introduction: visual consistency, text consistency, functional consistency, and special effects consistency.</p>
<p>The previous article has already introduced visual consistency and text consistency. This article will continue to explain functional consistency and special effects consistency.</p>
<h3 id="1-Functional-Consistency"><a href="#1-Functional-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="1. Functional Consistency"></a>1. Functional Consistency</h3><p><strong>(1) Position</strong></p>
<p>In games, key bindings are the premise of all operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, key prompts are crucial for novice players, helping them quickly get through the novice period.</p>
<p>The figure below shows two key prompts in <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>.</p>
<p>The prompt order for skill releases of “QERT” is exactly the same as the key bindings, which players can quickly learn;</p>
<p>However, the prompt for the unit operation keys of “XCV” is a bit “awkward”.</p>
<p>Not only are the horizontal keys not displayed horizontally, but the order is also reversed.</p>
<p>Players need to repeatedly confirm the operation and the position of the keys during learning, which increases the learning cost.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2Fbd4959f4-19e3-4bd6-a0bb-316fb65065c4.png/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade key prompts and their correspondence to the keyboard"></p>
<p>In addition to the correspondence of key bindings, the position of identical elements in different interfaces should also be as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s take the position of the simplest and most basic “close button” as an example:</p>
<p>Generally, the position of the close button in the same game is the same. If one of them suddenly changes position, it will be difficult for the player to find this close button.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the deployment interface and the unit formation interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>.</p>
<p>One is to select soldiers to deploy for battle, and the other is to preset the combination of soldiers to deploy in advance, which is a bit like a deck-building system.</p>
<p>In the design, considering the user’s habits, try to unify the operation area for selecting soldiers in the same position.</p>
<p>In this way, players only need to learn one system and they will be “familiar at first sight” with the other system, making it easier to get started without additional learning costs.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F91c1a8e9-c99e-4b86-8ad5-aa1afe984afe.png/size/" alt="Unit Formation"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The soldier selection operation positions of the deployment and unit formation interfaces in “Conqueror’s Blade” are consistent</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(2) Interaction Method</strong></p>
<p>Taking PC games as an example, mouse operations mainly include left-click, double-click, drag, right-click, and middle scroll.</p>
<p>These operations should also be kept as consistent as possible in the selection.</p>
<p>For example, in the armory (warehouse) interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, players mainly use right-click and left-click drag to transfer items.</p>
<p>Therefore, the operation of disassembling and assembling the abilities of the unit’s soul also follows the operation of right-click and left-click drag, ensuring the consistency of operation, so that players do not need to repeatedly memorize two sets of operating logic.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2Fcb679717-08d7-4a4d-924a-0b14011956d0.gif/size/" alt="Right-click and drag"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>The armory interface and the unit soul installation interface of “Conqueror’s Blade” use similar operating methods</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-Special-Effects-Consistency"><a href="#2-Special-Effects-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Special Effects Consistency"></a>2. Special Effects Consistency</h3><p>It is often said that Apple phones seem to be smoother than Android phones, and Android phones always lag.</p>
<p>This is because the animation design of each app on Android is different, which gives people a feeling of fluctuating speed.</p>
<p>In contrast, slower animations seem to have slower loading speeds.</p>
<p>The iOS system is relatively more unified, so users will feel more comfortable and smooth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the design of the game, for common animations, we should also establish a general animation library and animation specifications to ensure the unity and consistency of sound, animation, and special effects.</p>
<p>The figure below is the basic animation document of <em>UNO!</em>, which is convenient for quick search and reuse during design.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F78a9e364-9c60-4c4f-bc13-cef70b2cfffa.jpg/size/" alt="Basic Animation Doc"></p>

<h3 id="3-Inconsistency"><a href="#3-Inconsistency" class="headerlink" title="3. Inconsistency"></a>3. Inconsistency</h3><p>The Consistency Principle does not always bring positive effects and a comfortable experience in all situations.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of this article, let’s talk about “inconsistency”.</p>
<p>Inconsistency is actually a dialectical way of using consistency.</p>
<p>Simply put, we make the same thing as consistent as possible, but two different things or similar things are made very “inconsistent” to help players distinguish and prompt.</p>
<p>For example, when buying items in the store, buying for yourself and buying for others seem to be the same purchase behavior, but they are actually different.</p>
<p>At this time, it is necessary to deliberately make the two “purchase” buttons very different to remind players that these two choices are different.</p>
<p>By making similar but different elements inconsistent in design, the consistency of the design is further highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F6ad57c3e-202f-435c-9d3d-7b8ef70c2271.png/size/" alt="Purchase VS Gifting"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Conqueror’s Blade》 store purchase and gifting pop-up window</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, we can also create surprises for players through inconsistency.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, most of the system interfaces are in shades of gray and black.</p>
<p>Then, in the optimized design of the unit soul system, which is the main feature of the latest season, a very bright color representing the unit’s quality is used as the background, giving players a refreshing feeling;</p>
<p>At the same time, colors are also used to help players classify the categories and qualities of units.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Consistency is a very basic principle and method in design, and it is also a way of classifying and recognizing the world and processing complex information. It is very important for every designer and needs to be implemented throughout.</p>
<p>But it is a tool, not a shackle. It should not be followed rigidly during use, but the Consistency Principle should be viewed with a progressive eye, and it should be balanced and updated.</p>
<p>For example, design specifications should also be updated simultaneously as the design progresses, otherwise the guiding significance of the specifications will be lost.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also possible to appropriately jump out of the norms and make certain innovations and breakthroughs, otherwise it is easy to make players feel boring and monotonous.</p>
<p>Under the condition of local unity, seek common ground while reserving differences, and make continuous progress.</p>
