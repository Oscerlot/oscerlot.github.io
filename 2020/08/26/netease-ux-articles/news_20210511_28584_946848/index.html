<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210511/28584_946848.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Interest Curve was proposed by Jesse Schell in his book <em>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>.</p>
<p>In games, movies, or performances, interest curves are often used to record how the audience’s or player’s interest changes over time.</p>
<p>And the game’s novice tutorial, in addition to allowing players to understand the basic rules of the game, is also the “face” of a game to attract new players’ interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can analyze how to make the game novice guide quickly capture the player’s heart in a short time from the perspective of the interest curve.</p>
<h2 id="01-The-Composition-of-Interest"><a href="#01-The-Composition-of-Interest" class="headerlink" title="01. The Composition of Interest"></a>01. The Composition of Interest</h2><p>In <em>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>, three main parts that make up interest are mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Inherent Interest</strong></p>
<p>Adventure, fantasy, uniqueness, and the reward mechanism itself are all interests.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Artistic Expression</strong></p>
<p>That is, the aesthetics in the game.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Sense of Immersion</strong></p>
<p>When players have a strong empathy for the tasks in the game, interest also arises.</p>
<p>In the previous article, we have already understood “Inherent Interest”;</p>
<p>Below we will continue to introduce the other two main components of interest - artistic expression and the sense of immersion.</p>
<h3 id="1-Artistic-Expression"><a href="#1-Artistic-Expression" class="headerlink" title="1. Artistic Expression"></a>1. Artistic Expression</h3><p>The aesthetics in the game are usually reflected in exquisite graphics, eye-catching special effects, excellent camera language, beautiful music, and cute little details.</p>
<p>These aesthetic enjoyments can also bring certain spiritual stimulation to players.</p>
<p>Taking the game <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em> as an example, it firmly grasps the player’s heart in the early stage of the plot with its highly recognizable art style and excellent camera narrative method.</p>
<p><strong>Cute Animation</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning, Ori, the child of the Spirit Tree, falls into the forest and is picked up and adopted by the mother beast Naru.</p>
<p>The scene where Naru gently holds Ori in her arms is particularly warm in a dark storm.</p>
<p>In this way, the audience is brought to the first emotional high point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Fde8febb3-cd68-439a-a311-7543b3328f50.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;de8febb3-cd68-439a-a311-7543b3328f50.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Naru found Ori and held Ori in her arms</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ingenious Details</strong></p>
<p>Naru takes Ori out to find food and makes a mark on the tree that has been picked.</p>
<p>This kind of small and clever detail, which is relatively secondary to the plot but can give the audience a knowing blow, is often very moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Fa4d55557-859a-4a9b-9139-41d8cadffc15.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;a4d55557-859a-4a9b-9139-41d8cadffc15.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Naru takes Ori out for food and draws a small cross on the tree that has been picked</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Excellent Camera Language</strong></p>
<p>In the next paragraph, the Spirit Tree is severely damaged, and the entire picture darkens.</p>
<p>In the process of Ori going out to find food for the exhausted Naru, the shadows of the past reappear one by one at the location at that time.</p>
<p>This scene further intensifies the player’s emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F3fcfd515-f082-450f-8a79-db05260bf462.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;3fcfd515-f082-450f-8a79-db05260bf462.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ori goes out to find food for the exhausted Naru, and the past emerges</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It should be noted here that low emotion does not mean low interest.</p>
<p>When the player’s emotions follow the game’s sadness or anger, it is often the peak of interest.</p>
<p><strong>The Use of Light, Shadow and Tone</strong></p>
<p>In the above scenes, we can clearly feel the changes in tone, light, and shadow in the three clips.</p>
<p>The quiet blue, the bright yellow-green, and the terrible dark red make the scene atmosphere very prominent.</p>
<p>In addition, Ori and Naru are always the brightest presence in the picture, allowing the audience to clearly focus their vision.</p>
<h3 id="2-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#2-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="2. Sense of Immersion"></a>2. Sense of Immersion</h3><p>When players empathize with the protagonist of the game, they will naturally have a strong interest in the fate of the protagonist.</p>
<p>Jesse mentioned that when players first come into contact with the game, the protagonist is a stranger to them;</p>
<p>If a good sense of immersion can be achieved later, the player will treat the protagonist as their friend, and even eventually bring it into themselves and empathize.</p>
<p>The game <em>Florence</em> does a very good job in terms of “sense of immersion”.</p>
<p>First of all, the game uses a plot that is highly consistent with the real life of most players.</p>
<p>Such a plot itself will give players a feeling of “you have me, I have you”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F896443e4-87dd-4be1-b21b-1e5433ceae66.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;896443e4-87dd-4be1-b21b-1e5433ceae66.gif"><br>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F5e3241fb-2430-4504-8525-b24974ea28f5.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;5e3241fb-2430-4504-8525-b24974ea28f5.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Florence’s growth process</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the same time, immersive interaction can also make players empathize.</p>
<p>When Florence has problems with her boyfriend’s relationship, the player wants to put together puzzles and photos from Florence’s perspective.</p>
<p>When starting to put the puzzle together, the player will think that the two protagonists should sleep facing each other;</p>
<p>But after putting it together, it is found that the two are not only back to back, but also have irreparable cracks in the middle.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the player tries to put the photo together, the photo keeps drifting away, which can evoke the player’s inner melancholy.</p>

<h2 id="02-The-Embodiment-of-Interest-Curve-in-Novice-Tutorials"><a href="#02-The-Embodiment-of-Interest-Curve-in-Novice-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="02. The Embodiment of Interest Curve in Novice Tutorials"></a>02. The Embodiment of Interest Curve in Novice Tutorials</h2><p>We can use the above three key points that make up interest to analyze the interest curve of a novice tutorial.</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> is a game that does a very good job in novice tutorials.</p>
<p>We measure its interest points from the three perspectives of inherent interest, sense of immersion, and aesthetics, and we can get the following curve:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Ff88d46d4-875b-47fc-b324-4a03b9cbeb7b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;f88d46d4-875b-47fc-b324-4a03b9cbeb7b.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The interest curve of “Super Mario: Odyssey” in the novice tutorial stage</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The first peak point appears in the plot animation - Mario’s hat is trampled and torn by the boss.</p>
<p>The player’s interest is composed of the smoothness of the animation and the plot itself.</p>
<p>At the second peak - the hat ghost becomes Mario’s red hat, and the player shakes the switch handle to throw the hat forward.</p>
<p>The cute and immediate feedback and the near-real physical interaction make the game very interesting.</p>
<p>After the operation practice of Mario possessing the frog, it finally comes to the climax of the novice level - fighting the small boss.</p>
<p>The funny animation and challenging level design also push the player’s interest to the highest point.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also see a similar curve in <em>UNO</em>.</p>
<p>Animation, preliminary rule guidance, and the final stage of actual combat drills constitute the nodes in the novice tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F898d748e-2066-4c0b-8b86-f52957b3f973.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;898d748e-2066-4c0b-8b86-f52957b3f973.png"></p>

<h2 id="03-The-Inspiration-of-Interest-Curve-to-Game-Novice-Tutorials"><a href="#03-The-Inspiration-of-Interest-Curve-to-Game-Novice-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="03. The Inspiration of Interest Curve to Game Novice Tutorials"></a>03. The Inspiration of Interest Curve to Game Novice Tutorials</h2><p>Through the analysis of the above content, we can summarize that the interest curve provides the following three new thinking directions for analyzing the rationality of novice tutorials:</p>
<p>① Designers can analyze whether the setting of interest points of the novice tutorial on the timeline is reasonable from the time point, whether there is a long dull period that is likely to cause churn, or whether the setting time of the peak of interest is reasonable.</p>
<p>② We need to think about more directions that can be tried from the three constituent elements of inherent interest points, artistry, and sense of immersion, so as to make the interest curve better.</p>
<p>③ Understanding the composition of interest is also of reference significance to interaction designers:</p>
<p>   Novel and fun interactions can touch players;</p>
<p>   At the same time, immersive interaction can allow players to improve their understanding of the game and game characters in the process of interacting with each other.</p>
