<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>There are many kinds of mechanical elements in games, such as mechanical characters, mechanical equipment, vehicle games, construction games, etc. This article will discuss them from two dimensions: the creation of a sense of mechanics and the enhancement of immersion.</p>
<p>“Sense of mechanics” refers to the player’s subjective feeling about the characters, items, scenes and other elements in the game, whether they feel that these elements are like machines. “Sense of immersion” is whether the player is easy to enter the “flow” state during the game, and whether there is an experience of “I have become a mechanical element”.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The vehicles of <em>World of Tanks</em> and the mechanical structures of <em>Besiege</em> have a stronger sense of mechanics than the protagonist of <em>NieR:Automata</em> and the cartoon wheel of <em>UNO</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The wheel of <em>UNO</em> is only used as a lottery prop, and the construction of <em>Besiege</em> uses a God’s perspective. The sense of immersion is not as good as the other two games that directly let players control characters and tanks.</p>

<p>The character above uses sheet metal structure and metal materials to reflect the sense of mechanics. From a realistic point of view, its design is not reasonable, and it is suspected of showing off force. But this design is in line with the worldview in the game, that is, a technologically advanced centralized society.</p>
<h3 id="02-Detail-Obsession"><a href="#02-Detail-Obsession" class="headerlink" title="02 Detail Obsession"></a>02 Detail Obsession</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F58f5759b-68d5-410c-b091-54145ae8d0ff.jpg/size/" alt="《Warframe》Character"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fc584d56b-ecab-4d48-92bf-596fe89db43a.png/size/" alt="《Frostpunk》Building"></p>
<p>The same rich details, <em>Warframe</em> focuses on decoration; <em>Frostpunk</em> depicts the steel frame. These functional structures have stronger credibility.</p>
<h3 id="03-Reasonable-Structure"><a href="#03-Reasonable-Structure" class="headerlink" title="03 Reasonable Structure"></a>03 Reasonable Structure</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F91a48388-71f5-4882-9567-931fc73593c8.png/size/" alt="《Oblivion》Drone"></p>
<p>Form follows function. It can be seen from the appearance alone that the weapons and engines can rotate (“circle” and “sphere” shapes, meaning “rotation”). The internal structure explains the reason for this design from a rational point of view.</p>
<h3 id="04-Obeying-the-Laws-of-Physics"><a href="#04-Obeying-the-Laws-of-Physics" class="headerlink" title="04 Obeying the Laws of Physics"></a>04 Obeying the Laws of Physics</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210519%2F4e093805-e15a-4f8c-a7e7-d1492f5500d7.gif/size/" alt="World of Warships (PC), Acceleration and Steering"></p>

<p>In reality, it takes about 30 minutes for a warship to reach full speed. In the PC game, it is adjusted to about 30 seconds, which can still reflect the sense of cumbersomeness. In the mobile game, the ship turns while it is stationary, and it can even move, which is not realistic.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Ff17dbc9b-33d0-4b16-8059-fb00c18dd5cb.gif/size/" alt="《UNO!》 Spinning Wheel"></p>
<p>The pointer rebound of the wheel in <em>UNO!</em> is well handled, simulating the effect of a ratchet.</p>
<h3 id="05-Interface-Design-and-UI-Design"><a href="#05-Interface-Design-and-UI-Design" class="headerlink" title="05 Interface Design and UI Design"></a>05 Interface Design and UI Design</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fae008f16-2593-4034-a29f-ce9a595b2e94.jpg/size/" alt="《Soul Knight》 Using Mechs"></p>
<p>Putting on the mech, the appearance and skills of the character change, and borders and hexagons appear on the edge of the screen. Changing or strengthening the mech will change the color and style. Although it is a simple design, it is “rough but reasonable”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fd4f1aaa5-d50d-4c60-9350-8f031f1ea4a7.jpg/size/" alt="《Titanfall 2》 Pilot View (Top) and Titan View (Bottom)"></p>
<p>The difference between the pilot view and the Titan view is: In the Titan view, the skill bar in the lower left corner of the screen has changed, and at the same time, elements of the cockpit have been added to the screen. In addition, the shaking, footsteps and mechanical sounds when walking have been adjusted, and the Titan’s weapon interface has been added.</p>

<h2 id="Gameplay-and-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#Gameplay-and-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay and Sense of Immersion"></a>Gameplay and Sense of Immersion</h2><p>Next, take “ship” as an example to discuss the sense of immersion in the game from the perspective of gameplay.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F9b4f89e8-ce46-4f58-8f31-fd79a833b001.gif/size/" alt="《World of Warships》"></p>

<p>The coordinate axis below reflects the difference in immersion between these 3 games. Their core gameplay can be simply summarized as “displacement” and “action”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F087b3910-3b6b-4f07-8bdf-ffdc0efa471b.png/size/" alt="Feelings brought by 3 games to players"></p>
<p><strong>World of Warships</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the other 2 games, the gameplay is the simplest, only operating the warship.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the forward, backward and turning of the warship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - artillery, fish, consumables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The object of the player’s operation is always the warship, directly creating the feeling of “I am driving a ship”.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</strong></p>
<p>An RPG game with a naval battle mode. Players can switch between controlling the character or operating the ship (the character walks into or leaves the helm).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fb7bbf560-7c08-457f-97e2-fd0b74f7101d.gif/size/" alt="Player switching from operating the ship to operating the character"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the movement of the protagonist and the movement of the ship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - the attack, dodge, etc. of the character, and the firing, collision, etc. of the ship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the stage of driving the ship, the object actually operated by the player is the ship, but the game uses camera movement and adds character animation to “deceive” the player.</p>
<p>In the animation, the perspective is close to the third person of the protagonist, and the animation of the protagonist turning the helm can be seen; when firing, the perspective needs to be adjusted to the side of the ship, and the player can see the animation of the protagonist steering (left) and the sailor firing (lower right) at the same time.</p>
<p>After introducing the element of “person”, it will make players feel that “I am operating the character, and the character is driving the ship”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fe4a12b9d-bcc5-4692-b898-9573927f3fe3.jpg/size/" alt="The screen when firing"></p>
<p><strong>Fortnite</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Assassin’s Creed, there is a switch between characters and vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the walking and jumping of the character and the movement and acceleration of the ship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - the attack, construction, and use of consumables of the character, and the attack and use of consumables while sitting on the ship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F1ca40b0f-c4f8-48ec-93d8-3a756cc1857a.jpg/size/" alt="《Fortnite》, Driving and Sitting on a Boat"></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> has a novice tutorial, and the two gameplays are slightly different in operation, while <em>Fortnite</em> directly uses the keys and perspectives when operating the character. One player can only choose to drive the boat (mainly considering displacement) or sit on the boat (mainly considering action, using weapons to attack), and the learning cost is low.</p>
<p>In the vehicle mode, the camera is the same as the normal mode, which further reduces the feeling of switching between the character and the ship. It is the game that is most like “I am operating the character” among the 3 games.</p>
<h3 id="Methods-of-Designing-a-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#Methods-of-Designing-a-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Designing a Sense of Immersion"></a>Methods of Designing a Sense of Immersion</h3><p><strong>01 The object actually controlled by the player is a machine</strong></p>
<p>The previous article analyzed this point from the perspective of gameplay. If the control object is a character, but still needs to operate the machine, what will happen?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F35b7ba17-b719-462d-9942-ecb30a1cd111.gif/size/" alt="《RAFT》, Simulating Rafting at Sea"></p>
<p>Players need to turn on the engine, light up the radar, and operate the rudder. This gameplay is suitable for business simulation games. The ship is not like a whole, but a combination of parts; The player’s attention is not on the ship, but on the character.</p>
<p><strong>02 The player’s psychological feelings can be realized through guidance</strong></p>
<p>The camera movement and character animation in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> are examples of excellent use of this method.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can also use the switch between pilots and Titans in <em>Titanfall</em> to illustrate:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F2b903c83-af4a-4d40-85f2-b9ebd3092a44.gif/size/" alt="Game video, the pilot boards the Titan"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F97e060c8-297c-4b4c-8751-c8feaa5d3934.gif/size/" alt="Processed video with boarding animation removed"></p>
<p>In the first picture, players will feel that the Titan belongs to the pilot’s equipment;</p>
<p>In the second picture, the pilot and Titan seem to have become two independent characters in the game, and players can choose one to control.</p>
<p>The guidance method can adjust the sense of immersion in the game.</p>
<p><strong>03 Switching control objects cannot bring cognitive burden</strong></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, switching from controlling the character to controlling the ship is a positive case.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug 1</em> is a counterexample:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F23ea9a0a-4892-49a0-9962-3848b855415e.gif/size/" alt="《Metal Slug 1》, Operating the Machine Gun"></p>
<p>In other levels, the shooting direction is the same as the moving direction, but in this level, it is opposite. If you want to shoot from right to left, the player needs to press the right direction key.</p>
<p>Because it uses the action of the gun (shooting), but matches the displacement of the character (opposite to the shooting direction), it may be a mechanism to increase the difficulty, but it does destroy the sense of immersion during the game.</p>
<p>How to design the mechanical elements in the game well is a huge topic. This article only makes some thoughts on the mentioned games from some angles. “Sense of mechanics” and “sense of immersion” are both ways to construct the game experience. I hope this sharing can bring you some inspiration.</p>
