<p>“Attention is the only portal of our mind, and everything in consciousness must pass through it.”<br>—— Ushinsky, a famous Russian educator and the founder of Russian educational psychology</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human attention is limited, and it is difficult for players to notice all the content of each interface in the game. How can we make the game more attractive and easier to get the attention of players? How can we make players pay more attention to the important content you want them to pay attention to? How can we allow players to avoid distractions during the game and get a better gaming experience? This article will introduce a way to enhance player attention - emphasis techniques.</p>
<h2 id="I-What-are-Emphasis-Techniques"><a href="#I-What-are-Emphasis-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="I. What are Emphasis Techniques?"></a>I. What are Emphasis Techniques?</h2><p>Emphasis techniques are methods to draw attention to a text area or image area. Emphasis techniques are very effective techniques to bring people’s attention to design elements.</p>
<p>Before delving into the problem, let’s first understand the characteristics of human memory and the principles of visual attention.</p>
<h3 id="Memory-Characteristics"><a href="#Memory-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Memory Characteristics"></a>Memory Characteristics</h3><p>Human memory is divided into short-term memory and long-term memory. Short-term memory automatically stores current information and is easy to retrieve, but its capacity is limited, so people can only maintain focused attention for a short time. When we perform a complex operation, if there are many restrictions and not enough clear guidance, it is easy to feel confused and irritable, not knowing how to continue, and the attention is interrupted.</p>
<h3 id="Principles-of-Visual-Attention"><a href="#Principles-of-Visual-Attention" class="headerlink" title="Principles of Visual Attention"></a>Principles of Visual Attention</h3><p>The area of the human eye that perceives visually only occupies a small part of the retina, which makes our visual ability very small and difficult to accommodate a lot of information at the same time. To keep the brain focused on something, there needs to be a clear goal. Once the human eye loses focus, it will lead to people’s attention being distracted and losing interest. Therefore, it becomes very necessary to help the brain organize basic element information when there is a large amount of visual information input. When facing exactly the same information, content, function, and interaction process, the different visual representations of elements will affect the efficiency, attention, and even understanding of information in the visual processing process.</p>
<p>Because of these characteristics, in order to enhance the player’s attention, it is necessary to make the presentation of information clear and definite, grab the player’s eyeballs in visual performance, make them easily capture the key information, and make a deep impression. Highlighting certain design elements through emphasis techniques aims to guide players to quickly obtain effective information, and allow players to pay attention to where you want them to pay attention. At the same time, it can also enhance the depth and layering of the game interface, thereby improving the player’s gaming experience.</p>
<h2 id="II-What-are-the-Emphasis-Techniques"><a href="#II-What-are-the-Emphasis-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="II. What are the Emphasis Techniques?"></a>II. What are the Emphasis Techniques?</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Bold&#x2F;Italic&#x2F;Underline</strong></p>
<p>If the designer wants to make the emphasized element look slightly different, they can consider making it bold, italic, or underlining it to emphasize topics, labels, titles, and small paragraphs of text. Using bold and thin together can well express the sense of hierarchy and convey the importance of the text. Bold is usually more popular because it brings little change, but it can clearly emphasize the target element. Italics also have little impact on the design and are also a very effective emphasis method. Sometimes it is easier to attract attention than bold, but italics are difficult to distinguish, and are very effective for special fonts. Underlining brings about great changes and violates the principle of easy identification, so it should be used as little as possible or not at all.</p>
<p>In the <em>Fall Guys</em> game loading page, the title of the game play introduction is emphasized in bold and underlined. When there are multiple titles on the page, the hierarchy of the titles is distinguished to guide players to read the game rules under the title.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Use Capital Letters</strong></p>
<p>Using capital letters can highlight the text you want players to notice. Uppercase and lowercase convey different feelings, which will affect readability, understandability, and usability. In a complex display area, using uppercase to emphasize labels or keywords will be very effective, which can enhance the sense of hierarchy and prevent small fonts from mixing with the background. Using capital letters is more effective when the font style cannot be adjusted, and the main text and title text can be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>In the settings page of <em>CSGO</em>, capital letters are used for the main title, detailed setting content, and reset button. When the page has more content and more levels, the use of capital letters distinguishes the primary and secondary content and highlights the key content.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Use Different Colors</strong></p>
<p>Using different colors is a very effective emphasis technique. Color can attract attention, integrate elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics. There are three types of cone cells in the human retina, and these three types of cone cells are more sensitive to different wavelengths of color. Therefore, when people see different sensitive color domains at the same time, the eyes will feel a strong contrast. Using different colors can achieve the effect of emphasis. The stronger the color contrast, the more attention it can attract.</p>
<p>Some colors are inherently more eye-catching than other colors. Red, blue, green, orange, and yellow feel from heavy to light. Warm colors can be used for foreground elements, and cool colors can be used for background elements. When matching elements, light gray is a safe color that will not compete with other colors. Light neutral tones can help us bring more visual effects. Of course, colors cannot be used without restriction. According to the number that people can recognize after a glance, the types of colors need to be limited to about five, and they should be used in conjunction with other emphasis techniques.</p>
<p>Saturated colors are more interesting and vibrant, and can attract attention. Unsaturated dull colors will make people feel serious, and unsaturated bright colors usually make people feel friendly. When you need to highlight product performance and efficiency, you can use unsaturated colors. More saturated colors will attract more attention than unsaturated colors. If you want to use different saturated colors in combination, please be careful, because they will visually interfere with each other and increase eye fatigue.</p>
<p>The stronger the brightness contrast, the more attention it can attract. Contrast will naturally attract people’s attention to an element. When an element contrasts with its surroundings, it will also appear visually heavier.</p>
<p>The use of color contrast is common in games.</p>
<p>In the start interface of <em>Onmyoji Arena</em>, the [Match] button is highlighted with a striking red color to distinguish the importance of the content by color, improve recognition efficiency, so that players can focus on the button at a glance, distinguish the primary and secondary levels from other content, attract players’ attention and also guide players’ choices.</p>

<pre><code>In *Naraka: Bladepoint*, colors are used to distinguish the quality of loot piles and equipment. Blue piles have &quot;normal quality&quot; equipment and props, gold piles have a &quot;highest quality&quot; drop probability, green piles must have &quot;soul jades&quot;, gold equipment is ultimate, purple is excellent, blue is good, and gray is ordinary. In combat scenarios with a large amount of information, color marking can help players quickly obtain information, and high-quality equipment is easy to stand out, and players can go to pick it up in a targeted manner.

<li><p><strong>Reverse Type</strong></p>
<p>Reverse type refers to printing text or lines in intaglio to expose the white of the paper. It is a striking and eye-catching method. Using reverse type on a darker color block and not filling the image and text with any color can form a contrast, which can make the image and text appear more clearly. Reverse type is suitable for text, but not so much for images or shapes. It should be noted that although reverse type can attract people’s attention, the design scheme will also change significantly as a result, so it should not be overused.</p>

*Without Reverse Type and With Reverse Type*

---

The interface of *Pokémon Quest* uses reverse type to highlight information, such as the dark background and white text of the level card. Due to the use of reverse type, its overall design style is also adapted to it.

<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Blinking</strong></p>
<p>Blinking refers to letting an element switch back and forth between two different states. This method can effectively attract attention. When most of the elements on the page are static, users are more likely to be attracted by dynamic things. It should be noted that the blinking technique is only suitable for emphasizing those important things that require people to react to them immediately. Since blinking will affect identification and easily distract people, once the notification effect is achieved, the blinking should be turned off immediately.</p>
<p>In the start interface of <em>Fortnite</em>, the design of the task button, if there is a new task, the button will keep blinking to attract players to click. After clicking to view, the blinking achieves the notification effect, and the button will return to its original state.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>The use of emphasis techniques also needs to be moderate. In a design work, the emphasized content should not exceed 10%. The percentage of emphasized elements in a work is inversely proportional to its effect. Emphasis techniques should be used sparingly and applied consistently throughout the design.</p>
<h2 id="III-Conclusion"><a href="#III-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="III. Conclusion"></a>III. Conclusion</h2><p>When players are introduced to a new game, the first impression is very important. To attract players’ attention, it is necessary to have clear information communication and a good visual experience. Emphasis techniques are an effective way to enhance player attention. Appropriately using emphasis techniques to organize information and guide the line of sight can make the game easier for players to get started, avoid wasting time, and reduce player churn caused by insufficient information communication, forming a better visual effect and gaining more attention.</p>
