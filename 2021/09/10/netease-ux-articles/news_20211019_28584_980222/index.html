</blockquote>
<p>“Devs, this class is too weak, it’s basically a bottom-tier class, please buff it.” “Devs, the damage output of the XX class is too low, I don’t want to be a tickle monster anymore.” In players’ daily game experience feedback, feedback about class strength has always accounted for a high proportion.</p>
<p>Game designers are often very cautious about adjusting the skill values of classes, because adjusting one class will also affect other classes, and the balance of the entire game’s classes may be affected. Moreover, the strength of classes cannot be adjusted frequently. It is impossible to nerf one day, buff a little the next day, and then nerf again the day after. Therefore, when making decisions about class adjustments, it is necessary to rely on the analysis of massive game data, and it is definitely not “distribution according to noise”. So how do designers make decisions based on these “voices of the people” from players, and whether to adjust the strength of a certain class that players feedback?</p>
<p>This article will share with you the reasons why “players feedback that a certain class is too weak” discovered in previous class-related research. As well as the common adjustment ideas that designers have for some class strength problems.</p>
<p>First, let’s break down the process of a player experiencing a new class and forming an opinion on the strength of the class:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-experience Expectation Setting:</strong> Players have expectations for a class before playing.</li>
<li><strong>Inital Perceived Strength:</strong> Comparing play experience to initial expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Usage Comprehension:</strong> Determining understanding and execution of skill usage.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Growth &amp; Allocation:</strong> Developing an understanding of class building.</li>
<li><strong>Actual Combat Strength:</strong> Gauging actual combat performance based on the above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many times, players and even researchers will be preconceived to think that the problem lies in the last step, that is, there is a problem with the numerical settings of the class itself, resulting in the output not being able to be hit or being easily killed. Therefore, suggestions such as increasing class damage are often given. But in fact, problems in any of the above steps will cause players to have a wrong judgment on the strength of the class. According to the breakdown of each process, we can divide the problem into the following 4 categories:</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-1-Disparity-Experience-Caused-by-Overly-High-Expectations-Deviation-in-Cognitive-Strength-of-Class-Role"><a href="#Problem-Type-1-Disparity-Experience-Caused-by-Overly-High-Expectations-Deviation-in-Cognitive-Strength-of-Class-Role" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 1: Disparity Experience Caused by Overly High Expectations &#x2F; Deviation in Cognitive Strength of Class Role"></a>Problem Type 1: Disparity Experience Caused by Overly High Expectations &#x2F; Deviation in Cognitive Strength of Class Role</h2><p>This problem occurs in steps 1 and 2. The reason for the problem is often that the strength and output ability of the new class are described too strongly in the early class promotion, or the role is not clearly introduced, which will make players have too high expectations for the strength of this class before the experience. After the actual experience, it is found that the strength of the class is not as high as expected, and there is an obvious sense of disparity.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> has a class called <em>Yingling</em> with 3 forms. The 3 forms are melee output, ranged output, and healing support. In the early promotion, the switching of the 3 states, as well as the characteristics of melee, ranged, burst output and healing, were emphasized. Before the experience, players easily think that this class is an all-round ACE class that can be melee, ranged output, heal, and buff. But in fact, these 3 forms cannot be switched freely. Due to the long CD, in a battle, it is expected to switch only 2-3 times. It is impossible for the player to switch to a healing state to heal themself at any time and then switch back to output. The design expectation of this class was never an all-round class. The advantage of this class is that it allows players to adapt to more scene needs and freely choose their preferred class.</p>
<p>Without understanding the actual positioning of the class, after the actual experience, players find that the output of this new class is not top-notch, and the support is not necessary, and the positioning is very awkward. So a lot of negative feedback appeared. This is a typical problem caused by excessive expectations and deviations in the cognitive strength of the class role.</p>
<p>For this type of problem, what needs to be adjusted is not the strength of the class, but to start with the player’s expectation management.</p>
<p>So how do we generally locate this type of problem? In addition to qualitative player feedback, our commonly used quantitative diagnostic method is to understand the player’s expected strength and actual experience strength through a questionnaire to see if there is an obvious gap between the two.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-2-Misunderstanding-of-Class-Skills-or-Misuse-of-Core-Skill-Rotation"><a href="#Problem-Type-2-Misunderstanding-of-Class-Skills-or-Misuse-of-Core-Skill-Rotation" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 2: Misunderstanding of Class Skills or Misuse of Core Skill Rotation"></a>Problem Type 2: Misunderstanding of Class Skills or Misuse of Core Skill Rotation</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 3. For example, the newly released <em>Yantian</em> class in <em>Revelation M</em>. To achieve one-shot headshot damage, you need to first stack bleeding layers with basic attacks. Each layer of bleeding can bring additional damage. The more damage layers, the higher the damage. Then use two damage-increasing skills, and then use sniper to deal massive damage. Some players just started playing and don’t know this kind of play style. They add two states when they meet and start sniping. The damage will be greatly reduced, and then feedback that Yantian is a tickle monster.</p>
<p>For this type of problem that causes players to think that the class is too weak, it is necessary to improve it by strengthening the guidance of class output methods. Sometimes designers will also actively simplify the output routine to reduce the player’s cognitive burden. For example, for classes that stack states, originally only two specific skills could be used to stack states, and now any output skill can be used to stack states, simplifying the output cycle. In this type of problem, in addition to the problem that the above output cycle is not correct, misunderstanding the core output skills is also a common situation.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, the quantitative data we generally use is the frequency of player skill use in dungeons or PVP gameplay to see whether the player’s skill use is inconsistent with expectations, and whether the wrong skills are used. Some classes that need to apply statuses will also use status-related data to diagnose whether the player is correctly applying statuses.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-3-Wrong-Class-Development-Direction"><a href="#Problem-Type-3-Wrong-Class-Development-Direction" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 3: Wrong Class Development Direction"></a>Problem Type 3: Wrong Class Development Direction</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 4. For example, the <em>Yingling</em> class in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> mentioned above, if the main form is <em>Yueming</em>. In <em>Yueming</em>‘s core output cycle, immobilization is a very important part. One is because this control is brought by the core skill, and the other is that immobilization is needed to ensure that the output cycle is played smoothly. Then for players who play the <em>Yueming</em> form of <em>Yingling</em>, the immobilization attribute must be high. But in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, immobilization is not the mainstream control attribute, and generally people will not focus on it. Therefore, many players who feedback that <em>Yueming</em>‘s output is weak are found to have low immobilization. In addition to the above classes with clear attribute emphasis. Classes with different types of output methods will also have different attribute emphases. Burst-type output, stacking critical strikes and critical damage will have high returns, and can achieve one-shot kills, and critical strikes are guaranteed profits. Stable output type classes, stacking attack will have relatively higher returns, improving the overall output level. Therefore, if the core attributes of the class are not correct, it will also lead to the expected strength of the class not being able to be well exerted.</p>
<p>The solution to this type of problem is generally to guide ordinary players through official guides or guides from top players. And the attribute leaderboards in the game also play a certain guiding role. Ordinary players can also learn the core attributes of the class by viewing the attributes of top players on the leaderboards. Because of this, after the launch of a new class, players will be allowed to experience it for 1-2 weeks before they really start to adjust the strength. It is necessary to let players familiarize themselves with the skills and point allocation methods. If the class is strengthened based on the winning rate data of players’ experience in a few days. It is easy to appear that after players are familiar with the skills and improve their training level, the class strength increases by a level, and they have to face a nerf, which will bring a more negative experience.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, you can directly pull out the attribute value data of players of each class, and you can intuitively see the attribute allocation emphasis of each class and whether it is correct.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-4-Class-Strength-Problems-Output-Environment-Problems"><a href="#Problem-Type-4-Class-Strength-Problems-Output-Environment-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 4: Class Strength Problems&#x2F;Output Environment Problems"></a>Problem Type 4: Class Strength Problems&#x2F;Output Environment Problems</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 5. The problems in the previous steps are more problems of player understanding and cognition, rather than the real problem of class design itself. If the previous problems are ruled out, and the player can play the class routine and cultivate attributes as expected by the designer, and the class performance is still poor, then it is necessary to consider the problem of the class itself.</p>
<p>But even if it is the problem of the class itself, many times it is not simply solved by increasing skill damage.</p>
<p>Before the launch of a new class, designers will conduct a lot of tests, and generally there will not be too much difference in numerical values from expectations. But what is not easily covered by internal testing is: the complex and changeable battle situation in the gameplay, and various dungeons with different mechanisms. For example, in a 1v1 battle situation, when the situation is relatively simple, the output can easily play its own output cycle. But once it comes to team battles or 5v5, the output will face the situation of being focused by multiple opponents. Coupled with control, the output environment is very poor, and it is difficult to play the expected output. In addition, most of the designers are top players, and they are often prone to overestimate the player’s reaction time and operating level, designing an operation cycle that requires too high operations, resulting in the real situation after the official launch, players can’t use it, or in other words, in a real and changeable environment, this kind of operation cycle is difficult to use smoothly.</p>
<p>This type of problem is often not solved by simply increasing the damage value, but by optimizing the output environment or reducing the output operation. For example, for classes with many skill combos or requiring stacking states, this core output cycle is relatively long. In actual combat, it is easy to be interrupted, resulting in the output not being able to be played. This situation is generally improved by enhancing the super armor (cannot be interrupted and controlled during the output process) or enhancing the control (first control the opponent to ensure that their output is not easy to be interrupted). Or reduce the duration of stacking states, such as originally needing to stack 15 layers to deal high damage, reduced to stacking 10 layers.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, you can look at the actual values of the class in the dungeon or PK to see whether the class performance meets expectations. Common indicators are: total output, DPS (output should have the appearance of output), damage taken, healing; number of kills (whether it has the demeanor of a main C), number of kills (survival environment). For example, to see whether the output of an output class is up to standard, in PK, the output and number of kills of the output class will be ranked among other classes to see if it meets the design expectations; in dungeons, DPS will be looked at. The DPS value can easily show whether there is a gap between the actual output capability and the expected output capability of the output class.</p>
<p>In summary, when a player feeds back that their class is too weak, it is not necessarily a problem with the class design itself. It is necessary to first judge whether the player has cognitive biases and is unfamiliar with class skills and attribute allocation. Only by finding the root of the problem can we “prescribe the right medicine”.</p>
