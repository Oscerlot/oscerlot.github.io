<h2 id="What-is-Game-IP-Crossover"><a href="#What-is-Game-IP-Crossover" class="headerlink" title="What is Game IP Crossover?"></a>What is Game IP Crossover?</h2><p>IP is the abbreviation of Intellectual Property, which is actually the legal concept of “intellectual property.” In the network context, the concept of IP is broader. Generally speaking, a cultural brand that can be independently disseminated on multiple platforms, developed in multiple dimensions, and realized for commercial monetization will be called an IP. IP usually has a complete worldview and values, with three basic characteristics: first, the diversity of forms of literary and artistic works; second, the hierarchical complexity of operating methods; and third, profound influence in social life. In other words, IP is actually a kind of word-of-mouth communication. It does not need to rely on advertising and marketing to achieve effective interpersonal publicity, and it can quickly gather audiences with similar worldviews and values, and even form a culture.</p>
<p>Such a desirable commodity will naturally not be missed by the game industry. IP crossover is now a major trend in the gaming world. In games, IP crossover usually takes the following forms:</p>
<h3 id="Crossovers-in-the-Same-Field"><a href="#Crossovers-in-the-Same-Field" class="headerlink" title="Crossovers in the Same Field"></a>Crossovers in the Same Field</h3><p>Crossovers in the same field, that is, crossovers between game IPs and game IPs. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which was very popular upon release, had a crossover with <em>Onmyoji</em>. Specifically, the crossover between <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and <em>Onmyoji</em> is a more common character crossover, adding <em>Onmyoji</em>‘s popular character Yoto Hime as a new hero to the game, and launching a series of <em>Onmyoji</em> crossover weapons and skins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fdbb1dace-9ba6-48b0-a253-d6a9f619f396.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;dbb1dace-9ba6-48b0-a253-d6a9f619f396.png"></p>
<p>Some game crossovers, in addition to appearance and character crossovers, will also bring their own gameplay, plot&#x2F;character settings into other games.</p>
<h3 id="Cross-Field-Crossovers"><a href="#Cross-Field-Crossovers" class="headerlink" title="Cross-Field Crossovers"></a>Cross-Field Crossovers</h3><p>There is also a cross-field crossover, such as a film-game crossover. Crossovers between games and film and television dramas, animations, novels, etc. are all counted in this large category. Specific crossover forms include the adaptation of film and television works into mobile games, and the simultaneous release of film and television dramas and games to promote the game through the popularity of film and television. For example, the crossover between the <em>Justice Online</em> PC game and the TV series <em>Ordinary Glory</em> is a very good crossover case. In the TV series, the behind-the-scenes story of how the <em>Justice Online</em> development team, in the face of the pressure of huge R&amp;D costs, adhered to the original intention of developing high-quality PC games in the turbulent wave of the PC game market, was included. It lets more audiences know the hardships of the staff behind the game through TV series.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Crossover-IPs"><a href="#Why-Crossover-IPs" class="headerlink" title="Why Crossover IPs?"></a>Why Crossover IPs?</h2><p>Attracting new users and increasing revenue and engagement are eternal propositions for games. The emergence of IP crossover promotion methods is also closely related to this. From the perspective of attracting new users, as the penetration rate of game users increases, the cost of acquiring new game users through traditional methods will also become higher and higher. Because IP itself has high cultural vitality, when using IP for publicity, it can be spread more easily and save promotion costs. On the other hand, the audience of the IP itself may also be transformed into game players, achieving the effect of acquiring new users from other fields.</p>
<p>From the perspective of promoting engagement, large IPs themselves have a broad mass base, which may highly overlap with the player groups in the game. Crossovering with IPs will undoubtedly excite these old players and increase their stickiness to the game. Some original lost players may also return due to IP activities. For non-IP audiences, it can also increase the novelty of the game. Furthermore, good crossover events may also bring self-propagation among players, bring more users, and the game’s revenue will naturally increase.</p>
<h2 id="What-Role-Does-User-Research-Play-in-IP-Crossovers"><a href="#What-Role-Does-User-Research-Play-in-IP-Crossovers" class="headerlink" title="What Role Does User Research Play in IP Crossovers?"></a>What Role Does User Research Play in IP Crossovers?</h2><p>IP Crossover sounds like a marketing-oriented content, so what role can user research play in it?</p>
<p>First, it’s the choice of IP. Although IP is good, the value of the IP itself and the degree of fit between the IP and the game may not be high. A good IP is either one that has a wide enough audience, so no matter what game it crosses over with, it can cover a part of the population. But this type of IP is expensive and everyone is scrambling for it. Not to mention the cost-effectiveness, the cooperation may not even be negotiated. The other is that its audience highly overlaps with a certain game, and the user similarity is extremely high, so the players will have a higher acceptance of the worldview, character settings, etc. It is not easy to have problems, and it may also achieve the effect of small cost and large income. The user research department can help the product conduct research on all these issues at an early stage.</p>
<p>When an intended IP has been selected:</p>
<p>① UE can conduct desk research to investigate the player characteristics and audience range of the target IP, and create a user persona of IP fans, helping to screen the fit between the IP and the game itself.</p>
<p>② On the other hand, it can also investigate what classic elements the IP itself has, and what are the most famous&#x2F;most nostalgic events, to help determine the content suitable for crossover.</p>
<p>③ In addition, UE can also conduct research on existing players in the game to understand players’ awareness and acceptance of the IP, and avoid possible risks after the crossover. No matter what, it is very counterproductive for old players to disapprove of the crossover IP. Old players should at least have a neutral attitude towards the IP.</p>
<p>Of course, when no intended IP has been selected, UE can also conduct research to understand what IP players most want to crossover with, and how different IPs are favored by game players.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the crossover event has been launched, UE often comprehensively tracks the crossover effect through public opinion monitoring, questionnaire tracking, data analysis, telephone surveys, and other methods. For example, how do we know who are fan players and how do they feel about the game? And which part of the fans has a good conversion effect and can increase publicity, and which fans have a poor conversion effect? The user research department can tag players with fan labels and source labels when they enter the game, regularly track all data of these players in the game, and combine qualitative research methods to understand their true inner thoughts.</p>
<p>There are many other things that user research can do in IP crossovers, including but not limited to: new user acquisition effect prediction of the crossover, new fan player persona, fan retention analysis, crossover event analysis, external public opinion tracking, fan communication characteristics analysis… Of course, don’t forget that regular tracking and risk assessment of old players are very important.</p>
<p>In summary, IP crossover is both an opportunity and a risk. Only by truly doing user research well is it responsible for the game.</p>
