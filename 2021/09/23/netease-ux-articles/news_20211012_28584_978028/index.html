<p>Do you remember the frog son you raised in those years? When you open <em>Tabi Kaeru (Travel Frog)</em> with a忐忑 (tǎn tè - uneasy; apprehensive) mood, not knowing if your baby frog has come home, packing his bags for him, paying attention to his every move, and smiling like a loving mother when you see the postcards he sent back… That’s right, you are hooked. This type of education simulation game (养成游戏 - yǎng chéng yóu xì) is a branch of simulation games. “Raising” (养成 - yǎng chéng) is its core element. Players need to cultivate a specific object (human or animal) in the game and make it successful. The sense of accomplishment brought by the game is the key to keeping players hooked.</p>

The Psychological Mechanism Behind “Raising”</h2><p>Raising games are divided into many categories, such as love raising, assistant raising, pet raising, and parent-child raising. The attributes of the raised object determine the development of the game plot and the outcome of the player’s game. For example, the object’s level qualifications, item equipment, skills, image skins, etc.</p>

<p>The addictive feeling in raising games lies in people’s psychology of “the more you get, the more you want” (Diderot effect or matching effect), which refers to the phenomenon that when people don’t get something, they feel very calm, but once they get it, they are not satisfied and constantly configure items that match it. In the game, the novice tutorial triggers new players to act, complete tasks, and receive corresponding rewards; then it triggers user investment and forms a closed loop. In the process, the attributes of the object are constantly changing and upgrading. Players get satisfaction from it, and the sunk cost continues to push users to enter the next round of closed loop.</p>

The child’s attributes determine the direction of the plot and the ending. Players need to arrange the child’s learning tasks with limited physical strength. According to the different schedules arranged by the player, the child’s IQ, EQ, physical strength, memory, imagination, and courage will change accordingly. Players also need to balance parental satisfaction and the child’s stress. In the game, the child’s admission results and future development are the incentives for players to constantly invest time. In essence, it is an opportunity for players to “redo” their lives in the game. It is to satisfy the player’s self-actualization and high-level needs, and it is also the reason why this type of raising game makes players play happily.</p>

<p>In the game, in addition to being expressed in the form of numerical values, these attributes are also designed in the form of elimination games as a brain map. The higher the number of brain layers, the higher the understanding that can be obtained. Players need to constantly dig deeper, and the skills of digging brain holes are the key for players to improve their children’s attributes.</p>

<p>The game also includes many interesting plots and settings —– face-to-face battles between parents, class committee elections, red envelope wars, Chinese talents, and so on. The authenticity of these details makes many players see their childhood selves. In essence, it is the knowing smile and resonance during the game process that made this game rush to the second place on the Steam rankings as soon as it was released.</p>

During the game, players need to match different shikigami according to the battle mode. Drawing charms to draw shikigami, when players draw rare shikigami, it will bring them great satisfaction.</p>

<p>For players, winning in fierce challenges is the main source of their satisfaction. When the difficulty continues to increase, players may feel frustrated in the challenge, and the raising system will come into play at this time; on the one hand, by increasing the level, the player’s winning rate is improved. On the other hand, the raising system provides players with feedback and rewards, invisibly helping users to subdivide tasks. Through the cycle of raising and challenge, users are guided to invest more time and cost. Offset the accumulation of users’ negative emotions, and improve users’ stickiness and loyalty.</p>

<p>This is actually the application of Pavlov’s classical conditioning theory. Pavlov’s experiments show that neutral stimuli (bells, red lights, etc.) that originally could not cause a certain instinctive reflex, when they appear repeatedly with stimuli that can cause instinctive reflexes, this neutral stimulus can also cause instinctive reflexes.</p>
<p>Players constantly train the raised objects in the process of challenge, and the objects win in the duel. Strengthens the connection between raising and victory, making the raising process more “enjoyable”. Form a learned reflex and increase the satisfaction that users get during the raising process.</p>
<p>Different behaviors of players in the raising system. Such as collecting materials, upgrading, training, etc., will bring users a certain sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Repeating the “raising - challenge” cycle strengthens the player’s association with raising and victory.</p>
<p>Under repeated cycles, the satisfaction brought by the raising system is enhanced.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to challenge, the raising process has also become an important source of the game’s sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The two cooperate to effectively balance the negative emotions brought by players facing stronger opponents, balance the rhythm of the game, and constantly give players positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>The interaction between the raising system and the challenge system</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Establish a connection between the raising system and the challenge system, and constantly cycle to improve the positive experience of user raising.</p>
<p>Of course, the setting of the raising system needs to consider the following two points:</p>
<h3 id="Rhythm"><a href="#Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="Rhythm"></a>Rhythm</h3><p>It is mainly manifested as the time and frequency of the player’s actions on the raised object. High-frequency raising can make players get greater satisfaction in experience, but the player’s excitement will also decrease with the marginal effect. In addition, if the raising takes too long, players may lose patience before they are willing to invest a lot of time and cost, and directly abandon the pit. But on the other hand, the rhythm of the raising system determines the time and cost spent by players in the strategy. When the game update speed cannot keep up with the player’s strategy speed, it may also face a decline in player loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="Balance"><a href="#Balance" class="headerlink" title="Balance"></a>Balance</h3><p>The number of raised objects is related to the scalability of the game. Raised objects with different attributes and characteristics can bring higher degrees of freedom to the challenge system, and also determine the development space of the game. However, when designing raised objects, attention should be paid to grasping their balance and making them restrain each other. At the same time, avoid homogenization and retain uniqueness. Avoid players losing their sense of freshness and enthusiasm.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Raising games take advantage of the player’s psychology of “the more you get, the more you want”, allowing players to invest time and energy. In this process, the satisfaction that players get is an important reason for their addiction. Whether it is victory in battle, the growth of the raised object, the direction of the plot… These feedbacks meet the player’s needs for self-actualization in the game, so that they can learn conditioned reflexes in the cycle, and constantly bring players a sense of pleasure.</p>
