<p>In sentiment analysis, user researchers often encounter players giving vague, subjective feedback, especially in areas such as game art and story, such as: “I don’t really like the art style of your game”, “I feel the world-building is not good, not interested” … What’s more troublesome is that these feedbacks seem to be mostly “emotional output”, and cannot clearly point to problems that the product can perceive and ultimately form落地 (luò dì, meaning ‘grounded’ or ‘practical’) improvement measures.</p>
<p>Do players dislike the overall style? Or do they dislike the specific art or story design? Why don’t they like it? What targeted adjustments can the product make to reverse the player’s evaluation? If we want to understand these deep-seated needs behind players’ “emotional output”, user researchers need certain research methods to dig into their real thoughts, such as more detailed 1v1 interviews. How to do it specifically? This sharing will take the player’s evaluation of the game’s art style as an example to show you how to deeply understand the real thoughts of players by splitting and detailing the “art style” in the design and actual use of interview questions.</p>
<h2 id="Deconstruction-Which-Details-in-the-Game-Will-Affect-Players’-Perception-of-the-Overall-“Art-Style”"><a href="#Deconstruction-Which-Details-in-the-Game-Will-Affect-Players’-Perception-of-the-Overall-“Art-Style”" class="headerlink" title="Deconstruction: Which Details in the Game Will Affect Players’ Perception of the Overall “Art Style”?"></a>Deconstruction: Which Details in the Game Will Affect Players’ Perception of the Overall “Art Style”?</h2><p>To understand what specific factors prompted players to give negative reviews of the game’s art style, the first thing to do is to deconstruct the relatively general term “art style”: when players evaluate the game’s art style, what modules and details will they think of? Based on past experience in art style research, we have compiled the following detailed elements:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Module</th>
<th align="left">Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Overall Atmosphere</td>
<td align="left">Overall color, lighting, saturation, brightness, whether the elements are in harmony, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Character Design</td>
<td align="left">Character modeling, clothing, accessories, body proportions, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Scene Design</td>
<td align="left">Building modeling, special effects, color matching, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">UI Design</td>
<td align="left">Interface fonts, frame design, color matching, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Animation and Special Effects</td>
<td align="left">Action fluency, special effects presentation, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Other</td>
<td align="left">Whether it conforms to the world view, whether it matches the gameplay, etc.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>With the deconstruction of all the module details that may affect the player’s evaluation of the game’s “art style”, in the questionnaire and interview question settings of the 1v1 art style test, we can design specific questions for these detailed points. For example, in a test on players’ art style evaluation, we carried out some detailed digging for product needs and some feedback points that players might have in the pre-test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>“Do you think the overall art style is acceptable?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Completely Unacceptable”</li>
<li>“Unacceptable”</li>
<li>“Acceptable”</li>
<li>“Can fully accept”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“What are the reasons for your previous choice?”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“What do you like about the art design of this game?”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“What do you <em>not</em> like about the art design of this game?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only in questionnaire and interview design, but also in the final presentation of player feedback, user researchers also need to explore and summarize the details of different aspects, and strive to provide a complete blueprint for the product’s art improvement strategy. For example, in one test, overall, players were not satisfied with the game’s art style, but when analyzing player feedback, we found that players’ specific dissatisfaction with the game’s art could be roughly categorized into three aspects: in-game art, appearance art, and interface art.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Main Dissatisfaction Aspect</th>
<th align="left">Specific Issues</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Combat Scene Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Scenes are monotonous, lacking atmosphere, character models and actions are stiff, special effects are not gorgeous</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Character&#x2F;Item Appearance Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Character models are not good-looking, clothing lacks characteristics, wings are too large</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>UI Interface Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Fonts are not beautiful, icons are not exquisite</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Therefore, when providing suggestions for modification, we will also look for details of relevant competing products for reference according to the players’ art needs at different levels. For example, in terms of in-game art, we referred to some designs of Onmyoji and provided some more practical suggestions, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adding scene interactions with the environment (Grass interactions, environment destruction)</li>
<li>Add Weather Effects, and have them tied into environment interactions (Rain effects)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Mining-Beyond-Art-Design-Factors-That-May-Also-Affect-Players’-Style-Evaluation"><a href="#Mining-Beyond-Art-Design-Factors-That-May-Also-Affect-Players’-Style-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Mining: Beyond Art Design, Factors That May Also Affect Players’ Style Evaluation"></a>Mining: Beyond Art Design, Factors That May Also Affect Players’ Style Evaluation</h2><p>Some may think that as long as all the elements in the game that may affect the player’s art style evaluation are listed, the player’s one or several specific deep-seated needs can always be found. In fact, this is not the case. When evaluating some special styles, the influence of art design itself may not be as great as imagined. Instead, there are other things outside the game that may affect the player’s “first impression”. For example, in a research on the art style of a game with a Western fantasy background, a player said:</p>
<p>“I don’t really like the art style of this game… I can’t say exactly, I just don’t like it. I usually prefer to play games like Onmyoji.”</p>
<p>Although the player did not give specific art feedback suggestions, his words actually hid the reason why he did not accept the art style of the research game - the influence of other games. Obviously, the player’s game experience will shape his game art preferences to a large extent.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Players will have their <em>own</em> preferences that have been shaped by their <em>prior</em> experiences.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Different types of games will tend to have distinct styles.</li>
<li>If you are attempting to deviate, expect resistance from players who prefer a certain style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The art preferences of players of different game genres are largely influenced by popular games of that genre. How to attract players of different genres into the game as much as possible and meet their art-related needs has become the focus of many game development teams.</p>
<p>In addition, other media or pop culture product experiences also affect some players’ art evaluation of some specific style games to a considerable extent. Still in this research on the Western fantasy background game, some players gave feedback like this:</p>
<p>“I don’t really like the art style of this game, I just think it’s very ordinary… I have actually seen the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series before, and I feel that some of the elements inside are too familiar…”</p>
<p>Obviously, the player buried a pitfall in this feedback. Does he accept the Western fantasy art style? If you only look at the first half of the feedback, the answer may be yes. But later, when he mentioned the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, a new question arose: if he can accept movies of this style, why didn’t he accept games of similar styles and elements? Obviously, behind this answer, there are still some deeper art needs waiting for us to explore.</p>
<h2 id="In-Conclusion"><a href="#In-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In Conclusion"></a>In Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is the product or the user researcher, when facing players’ evaluations such as “I don’t like the art style” and “I don’t like the world view and story style”, they may be somewhat confused - where are their points of dissatisfaction? Do we really have such a problem? If so, what improvements should we make? In fact, we can deconstruct these general feedback points through forms such as 1v1 player interviews or research, and finally dig out the needs behind these dissatisfaction emotions. Here, the spirit of “getting to the bottom of things” is very important.</p>
