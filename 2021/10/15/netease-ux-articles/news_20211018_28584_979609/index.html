<p>Emotional design refers to a design approach that takes users’ feelings and emotions as the starting point. Emotional thinking is ubiquitous in games, such as the atmosphere created in the game world during real-world festivals, game sprites with cute appearances that greet you, and world announcements when rare treasures are unearthed (the system helps you show off), and so on. Among the various emotional design elements in games, falling in love and making friends with NPCs is a relatively unique experience for many players. Especially in recent years, in order to make this process feel more realistic, and not just a stack of numbers, planners will plan the interactive content between players and NPCs based on emotional development. To be more realistic, it must be more like the emotional development between two “living people.” The most commonly referenced rule for emotional development between people is “Social Penetration Theory.”</p>
<h2 id="Social-Penetration-Theory"><a href="#Social-Penetration-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Social Penetration Theory"></a>Social Penetration Theory</h2><p>Social penetration theory refers to the process of relationship development that individuals experience from superficial communication to intimate communication. This theory was proposed by Irvin Altman and Dalmas Taylor (1973). Social penetration theory believes that intimacy is not only manifested physically, but also includes intellectual, emotional, and participation in activities together. Therefore, the social penetration process must include verbal behavior (our words), nonverbal behavior (body posture, expressions, etc.), and environmentally oriented behavior (the distance between the communicator and the audience, etc.).</p>
<p>In social penetration theory, the escalation of intimate relationships between people can be divided into the following stages:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Orientation</td>
<td>Individuals reveal small parts of themselves, engaging in small talk and simple, harmless clichés.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exploratory Affective</td>
<td>Individuals start to reveal more about themselves, such as their opinions and attitudes on moderately personal topics. This is the stage where casual friendships develop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Affective</td>
<td>Individuals become comfortable discussing private and personal matters. Criticism and arguments may arise. Close friendships and intimate relationships develop at this stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stable</td>
<td>The relationship reaches a plateau where personal aspects are shared openly and freely. The individuals have a deep understanding of each other, and their communication is highly efficient and predictable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Depenetration   <em>(not always present)</em></td>
<td>When the relationship starts to break down and costs exceed benefits, there is a withdrawal of disclosure, which leads to termination of the relationship.  This theory does not typically include depenetration stage.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Specifically in the game, taking the example of <em>Revelation M</em> and the interaction with Sikong Wangyue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F2cc1bf84-a7e4-4ae3-a124-d889eab480ab.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;2cc1bf84-a7e4-4ae3-a124-d889eab480ab.png"></p>
<h3 id="Orientation-Stage"><a href="#Orientation-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Orientation Stage"></a>Orientation Stage</h3><p>In the orientation stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of unexpected encounters and casual acquaintances. The topics of conversation are relatively shallow, the NPC’s attitude is not proactive, there is little interaction, and at least one party in the conversation is relatively polite. Wangyue will accept gifts from the player, but will not be proactive towards the player. Activities only include accepting the player’s team invitations and rumor commissions. The player’s understanding of Wangyue is limited to Wangyue’s displayed personality and behavior, and they do not understand Wangyue’s own story. They can only unlock some daily polite phrases (Echo Shells).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F80867190-93b5-4e77-a81f-395defbf03ee.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;80867190-93b5-4e77-a81f-395defbf03ee.png"></p>
<h3 id="Exploratory-Affective-Stage"><a href="#Exploratory-Affective-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Exploratory Affective Stage"></a>Exploratory Affective Stage</h3><p>In the exploratory affective stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of like-mindedness and regret not meeting sooner. There is some two-person interactive content, and they will expose themselves more in the conversation, and even proactively trouble the player. Wangyue is willing to be dressed up by the player (after being dressed up, Wangyue in the open world will look like the player dressed him up), and Wangyue will invite you to participate in a friend’s gathering.</p>

<h3 id="Affective-Stage"><a href="#Affective-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Affective Stage"></a>Affective Stage</h3><p>In the affective stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of mutual support. The chat topics involve emotional attitudes and more intimate two-person interactions. The interaction of drinking with Wangyue is unlocked. In the process of chatting with the player, Wangyue will act coquettishly (not so polite and distant) and will also tease the player (unlocking the Echo Shell “Reluctant to part with me?”), and will also reveal some of his own views on life and emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F31cc5abb-3dc2-41ca-98ed-48f5cf7b739c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;31cc5abb-3dc2-41ca-98ed-48f5cf7b739c.png"></p>
<h3 id="Stable-Stage"><a href="#Stable-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Stable Stage"></a>Stable Stage</h3><p>In the stable stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of mutual understanding and mutual affection. There are more private interactions and a more proactive attitude, and even more intimate nicknames. In the open world, the player can summon Wangyue to their side. Wangyue will send private messages to the player and proactively invite the player to go out (previous invitations were after the player talked to Wangyue, Wangyue invited the player to go together, this time Wangyue discovered something interesting and invited the player to go together).</p>

<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Reference of Social Penetration Theory for the design of NPC affinity activity content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Orientation Stage:</strong> The player and NPC have just met. The topics of conversation are relatively shallow, the NPC’s attitude is not proactive, there is little interaction, and at least one party in the conversation is relatively polite.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exploratory Affective Stage:</strong> The player and NPC begin to understand each other. There is some two-person interactive content, and they will expose themselves more in the conversation (past experiences, discussions of opinions on things), and even proactively trouble the player (implicitly inviting the player).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Affective Stage:</strong> The player and NPC become good friends. Chat topics involve more emotional attitudes (such as some deep reflections on life and emotions), more intimate two-person interactions (such as going out together), the tone becomes relaxed, and the words reveal familiarity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stable Stage:</strong> The player and NPC become close friends. The NPC becomes more proactive (when the player does not contact them, the NPC will actively contact the player). The player can trouble the NPC with more things, even including some high-value&#x2F;troublesome content (such as accepting the player’s invitation anywhere, sharing their unique skills with the player), and even have more intimate nicknames (a nickname for each other).</p>
