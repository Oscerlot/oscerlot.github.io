<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211026/28584_981752.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the depths of your mind, do you envision a dashing young man traveling the world with a sword? We may know about <em>wuxia</em> (武侠 - martial heroes) from the literary works of masters like Jin Yong (金庸) and Gu Long (古龙). Weaponry, martial arts, rare treasures, and love and hate are all things that people in the <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - martial arts world) care about most.</p>
<p>In today’s rapidly developing technology, games, as a new form of literary expression, have entered the world stage. And <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is one such authentic <em>wuxia</em>-style work, carrying the Chinese people’s innate pursuit of “freedom of the self” in the martial arts spirit, and conveying this spirit and culture to game lovers all over the world. So, for us, the first difficulty to overcome in overseas localization is how to translate the <em>wuxia</em> flavor in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> authentically?</p>
<h2 id="Faithfulness-Expressiveness-and-Elegance-信达雅-xin-da-ya"><a href="#Faithfulness-Expressiveness-and-Elegance-信达雅-xin-da-ya" class="headerlink" title="Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance (信达雅 - xìn dá yǎ)"></a>Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance (信达雅 - xìn dá yǎ)</h2><p>The translation rules of “faithfulness,” “expressiveness,” and “elegance” were proposed by Yan Fu (严复), a prominent enlightenment thinker in late Qing Dynasty China. In the “Introduction to Translation” of <em>Evolution and Ethics</em>, he said: “There are three difficulties in translation: faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance. It is already very difficult to achieve faithfulness! However, if it is faithful but not expressive, although it is translated, it is as if it is not translated, so expressiveness is still important.”</p>
<p>“Faithfulness” means that the meaning does not deviate from the original text, that is, the translation should be accurate, not deviate, not omit, and not add or subtract meaning at will; “expressiveness” means not being constrained by the original form, and the translation is smooth and clear; “elegance” means that the words used in the translation should be appropriate, pursuing the elegance and simplicity of the text itself.</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, the translation should conform to the characteristics of the Chinese language, pay attention to the integrity of a sentence, that is, content, structure, and style, that is, the accuracy of the content, the smoothness of the grammatical structure, and the literary grace of the language carrier. Taking Vietnamese localization as an example, the following will introduce how we design and adjust on the road of “faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance”.</p>
<h3 id="Faithfulness-Accuracy-The-“Vast-Sea”-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Faithfulness-Accuracy-The-“Vast-Sea”-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Faithfulness: Accuracy - The “Vast Sea” Case in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>Faithfulness: Accuracy - The “Vast Sea” Case in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h3><p>Many terms in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> use Chinese allusions, such as the “Vast Sea” (瀚海 - <em>hàn hǎi</em>) that we will mention next. The meaning of “Vast Sea” has changed drastically with the changes of history.</p>
<p>During the Han and Six Dynasties, “Vast Sea” was the name of a northern sea. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Huo Qubing attacked the Xiongnu’s left territory, went out of Dai County for more than two thousand miles, and returned after reaching the Vast Sea. By the Tang Dynasty, this term was transformed into a general term for the vast areas north of the Gobi Desert on the Mongolian Plateau and its westward extension to the Junggar Basin. Gao Shi, a frontier poet of the Tang Dynasty, wrote in “Song of Yan”: “The lieutenant’s feather book flies to the Vast Sea, and the Chanyu’s hunting fire illuminates the Wolf Mountain.”</p>
<p>In the game, we also have related terms: “Wind of the Vast Sea*”. This is also a challenge for our translation team. Is this wind blowing from the sea? Or from the desert? In order to accurately translate the meaning of the term, we compared the art resources inside the game and confirmed that the term corresponds to Canaan’s desert-style skin. Combining with the meaning of the term, we gave an accurate translation.</p>

In the early stage, we directly translated <em>tachi</em> into “Thái Đao” (the Sino-Vietnamese word for <em>tachi</em>).</p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211026%2F9b3d4418-82be-438c-8217-40a76dde7cbd.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211026&#x2F;9b3d4418-82be-438c-8217-40a76dde7cbd.png"></h2><h2 id="Figure-2-The-Vietnamese-term-for-tachi-does-exist"><a href="#Figure-2-The-Vietnamese-term-for-tachi-does-exist" class="headerlink" title="Figure 2.

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. There are 18.5 million search results for searching “Thái Đao”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the launch, we never expected that the translation of this word would become the focus of discussion in the community that day.</p>
<p>In the Vietnamese understanding, <em>tachi</em> is a sword. So players had a heated discussion about whether <em>tachi</em> is a “dao” (刀 - knife&#x2F;sabre) or a “kiem” (剑 - sword). Since “太” and “泰” (Thai) are homophones in Sino-Vietnamese, new players raised new questions: Why is <em>tachi</em> from Thailand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211026%2F068620b9-00ce-45c7-b654-f634db9f985f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211026&#x2F;068620b9-00ce-45c7-b654-f634db9f985f.png"></p>

Tachi引发玩家无数讨论的太刀 (Tachi that sparked countless discussions among players)"></a><em>Figure 4. Tachi引发玩家无数讨论的太刀</em> (Tachi that sparked countless discussions among players)</h2><p>At first, we were also nervous about this public opinion, fearing that players would be dissatisfied with our translation professionalism. But because Vietnamese is a modifier-head language structure, the grammatical confusion that “Thai knife” may cause is actually very small. In addition, “Thái” has the meaning of slender and narrow in Vietnamese. After discussing it on their own for a day, players expressed their recognition and understanding of our translation version.</p>
<p>In such a positive and active communication, we are very happy to have such a group of players in the community who care about the details of the game. As the saying goes, the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, and the same is true for translation. Whether it is for our localization colleagues or players, <em>tachi</em> has left a deep impression on our hearts.</p>
<h3 id="Elegance-Beauty-The-Wuxia-Style-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Elegance-Beauty-The-Wuxia-Style-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Elegance: Beauty - The Wuxia Style Case in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>Elegance: Beauty - The Wuxia Style Case in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h3><p>When novices first enter the game, we will be awakened by the Yin God as Ning Hongye, and then enter the novice teaching of climbing and collecting. The first few sentences in this stage are carefully designed. We adjusted the game translation content to a concise Gu Long style, using short sentences and imperative sentences, so that players can feel a chilling atmosphere as soon as they enter the game, instantly mobilizing the player’s adrenaline. Another advantage of this design is that it allows players to get clear guidance in the novice period, ensuring that information is delivered clearly and accurately.</p>

Gu Long’s novels are wuxia classics"></a><em>Figure 5. Gu Long’s novels are wuxia classics</em></h2><p>In addition, we also adjusted the translation style for different characters. For example, there are many differences in the style of writing in the background stories of Kurumi and Canaan. In Kurumi’s speech, we used a lot of exclamations and cute words to highlight the character’s innocence and cleverness.</p>

If these three points can be achieved, this game will build a bridge for overseas players, remove the obstacles and barriers of language, and allow us to jointly feel this martial arts world.</p>
