<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Idle games, when combined with combat gameplay, usually appear in the form of RPG games. They automatically collect resources, automatically fight, and even skip the battle process for one-click tower climbing. Without considering interactive animations and sound effects, idle games almost return the operating feel of combat to the era of chess games, abandoning the stimulation of dopamine and adrenaline in action battles. Players hardly need to operate to defeat enemies and win battles. Player actions seem to be marginalized. So, where does the pleasure of combat in idle games come from?</p>
<h2 id="1-Combat-Mechanism"><a href="#1-Combat-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="1. Combat Mechanism"></a>1. Combat Mechanism</h2><p>Before answering this question, let’s talk about the combat mechanism of idle games. The purpose of the combat system design of idle games is mainly to verify the player’s growth, bring the fun of confrontation and social value, and cause empathy between the player and the character through combat. Like the battles of most RPG games, the battles of idle games also have rich combat mechanisms. Battles can be real-time, semi-real-time, or turn-based; players can control a single character or a team; characters have fixed positions or can move freely; the victory conditions of the game can rely on the numerical crushing of the cultivation system or the proficiency of the player’s operation… But before designing these rules, it is first necessary to clarify what kind of combat experience the game wants to bring. For example, <em>A Mobile Immortal</em> (一念逍遥) wants to express the realm of cultivators of different levels through combat. Its idle combat is not the team pushing tower of heroes, but借鉴《球球大作战》’s expression method shows the entire cultivation world, using the intuitive area comparison of large and small balls to show the qualitative change of the realm, bringing players the feeling of crushing and despising all beings. <em>Fantastic Planet</em> (妙奇星球) strives to create a relaxed and pleasant adventure atmosphere, and the combat is deliberately weakened. The single-line combat and the enemy design with weak offensive performance reduce the tension of the battle.</p>

<h2 id="2-Multi-dimensional-Decision-making"><a href="#2-Multi-dimensional-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="2. Multi-dimensional Decision-making"></a>2. Multi-dimensional Decision-making</h2><p>From the perspective of process analysis, in the main line combat mode, the player’s behavior is generally to build a hero lineup before the battle, manually or automatically release hero skills during the battle, watch the battle process, succeed and harvest the spoils to continue the next level of battle, fail and adjust or strengthen the hero lineup; while the hero automatically fights, the game settles the battle data, and then presents the result. The player’s behavior is mainly concentrated on the pre-war lineup construction, and the development and results of the entire battle, various battle details, spoils, etc. are the results derived from the player’s decision-making lineup. From the perspective of the operation-feedback experience design principle, the player’s operating behavior is simplified, but the decision-making results are extremely strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="Pre-battle-Decision-making"><a href="#Pre-battle-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="Pre-battle Decision-making"></a>Pre-battle Decision-making</h3><p>Taking <em>AFK Arena</em> as an example, players choose 5 heroes from the existing heroes to form a combination for a 5v5 battle. The battle lineup is an unequal position of 2 in the front and 3 in the back, and the attack target selection follows the principle of the nearest priority within the range. After changing the character’s position, due to the difference in attributes, the total output and damage taken by the character will also change, thereby changing the entire battle situation. In the lineup decision-making, players need to consider the influencing factors of 5 dimensions, including front and rear, up and down positions, skill sets, racial restraint, racial bonuses, and cultivation level (proficiency) differences, and skill set matching. Players can adjust the position or replace the hero to form a clearance lineup.</p>

<p>In order to optimize the player’s decision-making experience and minimize the difficulty and operating steps of decision-making, the hero selection interface of traditional idle combat games will show the scene of the two sides facing each other to render the atmosphere, express the sense of confrontation through a symmetrical layout, and at the same time display the combat power information of both sides, which is convenient for players to choose or upgrade heroes. Use quantified values to visually express the combat power of both sides, including the level, combat power, and total combat power of each character. Heroes are classified by attributes, sorted by level, and screened out commonly used formations or the strongest combat power to reduce the amount of thinking and operation of players. Explanations of the battle rules will be hidden by buttons, which is convenient for players to quickly understand the rules.</p>
<h3 id="In-battle-Decision-making"><a href="#In-battle-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="In-battle Decision-making"></a>In-battle Decision-making</h3><p>The player’s behavior during the battle is mainly to release character skills at the right time. Generally, players need to choose automatic or manual release. Some games directly remove the manual option and convert the skills into buffs, which simplifies the game process while saving art resources. In order to speed up the battle process, players can choose the playback speed of the battle animation. Manual combat is to manually select the timing of skill release. The skill cooldown is visualized graphically, and the character state changes after the cooldown to indicate that the skill is available.</p>

<h2 id="3-Combat-Performance"><a href="#3-Combat-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3. Combat Performance"></a>3. Combat Performance</h2><h3 id="Skill-Performance"><a href="#Skill-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Skill Performance"></a>Skill Performance</h3><p>After the own character takes a certain amount of damage or after a period of cooling time, the highlighted character symbol indicates that the big move is ready. When clicking to release the big move, time is frozen, and the screen is focused by means of translucent masks, zooming in on the character, etc., to strengthen the visual performance and thus fully demonstrate the own combat power, Enhance positive operating feedback, the skill animation is not interrupted, ensuring the smooth release of our hero skills; while the enemy is treated differently, time is not frozen, and it is not highlighted, so as not to interrupt the player’s combat experience. The cutscene of the big move also makes the whole battle process more ups and downs, and players don’t have to just watch the hero fight.</p>
<p>The animation time of skill release is limited. This is the result of balancing a single performance and the idle combat experience. Because no matter how cool the animation is, it is difficult to bring continuous stimulation and freshness after repeated multiple times, but it destroys the game experience. <em>Doomsday Crusader</em> (拂晓的拾荒原), as a two-dimensional battle, has expressive advantages and good art resources, but the animation time of its skills is also strictly controlled, and the animation duration is less than 1 second after double-speed battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F2c27faf1-0e16-4490-b1e7-c148396eaa2b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;2c27faf1-0e16-4490-b1e7-c148396eaa2b.png"></p>

<h3 id="Number-Pop-Up-Strategy"><a href="#Number-Pop-Up-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Number Pop-Up Strategy"></a>Number Pop-Up Strategy</h3><p>The types of information carried by number pop-ups include damage values, healing values, critical damage, buffs, evasion kills, and other status information. In order for this information to be clearly conveyed, the design will use color, font size, font, appearance time, duration, speed and other characteristics to distinguish.</p>
<p>For the battle between two multi-hero camps, players generally cannot accept a large amount of numerical and status information in fast-paced battles, especially instant battles inevitably develop into melees. The number pop-ups in this type of game combat give up allowing players to accurately receive data, but reflect the battle situation through a large number of rapid number pop-ups, emphasizing the feedback output of our side, and achieving the role of combat to verify the player’s growth. For example, in <em>AFK Arena</em>, although it is an instant battle, the number pop-ups do not appear with the attack, but a turn-based strategy is adopted. The damage values taken by the whole field appear synchronously at a time point in an end time, reducing the chaos of the battle screen.</p>
<p>The slower-paced turn-based combat can better avoid the problem of chaotic numerical information. The damage output number pop-ups appear sequentially after the character attacks, and the position is fixed, and the player can clearly receive the information. The battle of controlling a single character presents less information, and players can accurately receive it, and the number pop-ups can be extremely exaggerated in value. A typical example is the Demon Suppressing Tower battle of <em>A Mobile Immortal</em>, which has an exaggerated unit of measurement after its data, exaggerating the value.</p>

<h2 id="4-Combat-Rhythm"><a href="#4-Combat-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="4. Combat Rhythm"></a>4. Combat Rhythm</h2><h3 id="Battle-Duration"><a href="#Battle-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Battle Duration"></a>Battle Duration</h3><p>The battle duration of a single level of idle games is generally controlled within a short period of time, and the number of levels is large. This is because as a battle to verify growth, players get less experience in gameplay and can hardly tolerate a long period of boring waiting. The main purpose of the battle is to provide instant feedback, and numerous levels can provide multiple feedbacks at shorter intervals. This nature determines the fast pace of idle game battles. In addition to controlling the value of the life and output of both sides, the game can speed up the duration of a single game by simplifying decision-making steps and difficulty, doubling the speed of combat animation, shortening skill animation, and setting up automatic combat.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>To output a combat experience that conforms to the game style in a short period of time, it requires the cooperation of game mechanics, visual effects performance, interaction design, etc. Clarify the content of the experience output, and then shorten the battle duration and operating steps, exaggerate and strengthen the audiovisual output, even if there are few operations and short time, it can also output the best audiovisual experience effect.</p>
