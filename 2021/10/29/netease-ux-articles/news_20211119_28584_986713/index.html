<p>In user research, we often divide research methods into two categories: qualitative research and quantitative research. Qualitative research examines whether the research object has this or that attribute or characteristic, and whether there is a relationship between these attributes, through observation, experimentation, and analysis. Qualitative research consists of various methods such as interviews, observations, and case studies. Raw data includes interview records, photos, audio recordings, etc. The focus group that this article wants to introduce is a very classic method in qualitative research.</p>
<p>Previous articles have briefly introduced what a focus group is. Therefore, this article mainly compares focus groups with 1V1 interviews, analyzes the usage scenarios and advantages of focus groups. In addition, this article will also introduce how to apply focus groups and some tips for application.</p>
<h2 id="I-Usage-Scenarios-of-Focus-Groups"><a href="#I-Usage-Scenarios-of-Focus-Groups" class="headerlink" title="I. Usage Scenarios of Focus Groups"></a>I. Usage Scenarios of Focus Groups</h2><p>A focus group, also known as a focus group interview, is a small group discussion where a trained moderator interacts with a group of representative users in an unstructured, natural way to gain in-depth understanding of relevant issues.</p>
<p>The question is, since focus groups also involve talking with users, why use focus groups instead of 1V1 interviews? When is it more appropriate to use focus groups instead of 1V1 in-depth interviews to collect user feedback in the form of interviews?</p>
<p>Here, this article summarizes three scenarios where focus groups are applicable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When user discussion is needed:</strong> In some cases, we want users to communicate, exchange, and discuss with each other to generate more ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Time constraints:</strong> 1V1 in-depth interviews often take a lot of time. When research is limited to a short period of time, focus groups that can include multiple users at the same time are superior to 1V1 interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for observation:</strong> When product, operations, and marketing want to observe user feedback during the research process and obtain first-hand information, focus groups can provide more information in a shorter time compared to 1V1 in-depth interviews.</li>
</ol>

Focus Groups VS 1V1 Interviews</h2><p>By comparing focus groups and 1V1 interviews, which also involve interviews, we can more clearly understand the key points of focus groups.</p>

<h3 id="Different-Research-Objects-1V1-VS-Multiple-People"><a href="#Different-Research-Objects-1V1-VS-Multiple-People" class="headerlink" title="Different Research Objects: 1V1 VS Multiple People"></a>Different Research Objects: 1V1 VS Multiple People</h3><p>1V1 interviews, as the name suggests, use a model of one interviewer and one user&#x2F;interviewee. Focus groups use the form of seminars to guide users to discuss, which is a multi-person format. The number of research objects varies according to different topics. Generally, larger focus groups require 8-12 participants, medium-sized focus groups generally have 6-8 people, and small groups have 4-6 people.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the number of people in a focus group is more than that of a 1V1 interview, but it does not mean that conducting 6-8 1V1 interviews and conducting a 6-8 person focus group have the same effect. A focus group is not a superposition of 1V1 interviews.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Screening-Criteria-for-Research-Objects-Focusing-on-Research-Objectives-VS-Not-Caring-About-the-Same-Camp-or-Opposition-Based-on-Research-Objectives"><a href="#Different-Screening-Criteria-for-Research-Objects-Focusing-on-Research-Objectives-VS-Not-Caring-About-the-Same-Camp-or-Opposition-Based-on-Research-Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Different Screening Criteria for Research Objects: Focusing on Research Objectives VS Not Caring About the Same Camp or Opposition Based on Research Objectives"></a>Different Screening Criteria for Research Objects: Focusing on Research Objectives VS Not Caring About the Same Camp or Opposition Based on Research Objectives</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, we often screen users according to different test purposes. Commonly used screening indicators include age, gender, occupation, game experience, etc. Focus groups are no exception. The primary condition for screening is to focus on research objectives. However, focus groups do not exclude users with opposing views. That is, the users invited to the focus group may be a group of users with similar views, but users with opposing attitudes and views may be invited. Because, whether the views are similar or opposed, as long as effective communication and discussion can be generated.</p>
<p>Similar&#x2F;opposite views can be used as subjects of focus groups, which further emphasizes that focus groups are not simply gathering 1V1 interview users for interviews, but selecting appropriate users around the research objectives to let them communicate.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Forms-of-Conversation-Interaction-Between-the-Interviewer-and-the-User-VS-Interaction-Between-Users"><a href="#Different-Forms-of-Conversation-Interaction-Between-the-Interviewer-and-the-User-VS-Interaction-Between-Users" class="headerlink" title="Different Forms of Conversation: Interaction Between the Interviewer and the User VS Interaction Between Users"></a>Different Forms of Conversation: Interaction Between the Interviewer and the User VS Interaction Between Users</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, the interviewer and the user have a question-and-answer relationship, and the interviewer tries to inspire the user to express their views. In a focus group, the focus is on communication and interaction between users. Different from 1V1 in-depth interviews where users express their views individually, users in focus groups can compare their views with those of others, and further trigger attitudes of agreement&#x2F;opposition, and continue to output views.</p>
<p>Compared with 1V1 interviews that focus on the interaction between the interviewer and the user, focus groups pay more attention to the interaction between users.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Roles-of-the-Interviewer-in-the-Test-Frequent-Communication-and-Exchange-VS-Ability-to-Control-the-Scene"><a href="#Different-Roles-of-the-Interviewer-in-the-Test-Frequent-Communication-and-Exchange-VS-Ability-to-Control-the-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Different Roles of the Interviewer in the Test: Frequent Communication and Exchange VS Ability to Control the Scene"></a>Different Roles of the Interviewer in the Test: Frequent Communication and Exchange VS Ability to Control the Scene</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, we hope that the interviewer can communicate and exchange with the user relatively frequently during the interview process, keenly perceive the user’s psychological changes, and explore the user’s true thoughts. In a focus group, the interviewer needs to have good control skills to encourage all participants to actively join the discussion of the topic. Do not deviate from the topic, do not cause quarrels, and ensure that the topic is not led by “opinion leaders”.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared with 1V1 interviews, the advantages of focus groups are:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can collect information and data from more users in a relatively short period of time, which is more “economical” than 1V1 in-depth interviews.</li>
<li>They are more conducive to discovering user needs, attitudes, and reasons for attitudes: Thanks to group communication, users can have more inspiration and divergence when expressing their opinions, and the content generated can also obtain a direct comparison of attitudes on a topic through the collision of ideas between different users, which greatly enriches the views collected by researchers.</li>

<h2 id="III-Application-of-Focus-Groups-and-Small-Tips"><a href="#III-Application-of-Focus-Groups-and-Small-Tips" class="headerlink" title="III. Application of Focus Groups and Small Tips"></a>III. Application of Focus Groups and Small Tips</h2><p>Having understood the usage scenarios and advantages of focus groups, how should focus groups be conducted? Are there any tips?</p>
<p>First, in the preparation stage before the implementation of the focus group, the following can be done:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Determine Research Objectives</strong></td>
<td>Clearly define the goals and questions the focus group aims to address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Develop Interview Questions</strong></td>
<td>Prepare open-ended questions that encourage discussion and exploration of the topic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recruit Users</strong></td>
<td>Select participants who meet the criteria and represent the target audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Choose Venue</strong></td>
<td>Select a comfortable and conducive environment for discussion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prepare Materials</strong></td>
<td>Gather necessary materials such as name tags, recording equipment, and any stimuli for the discussion.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In this preparation stage, there are many things worth noting. The most noteworthy thing is that when determining the interview questions, it is necessary to clarify that different questions should be raised at different stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm-up questions before the start:</strong> Do not involve privacy, hope to encourage everyone to discuss.</li>
<li><strong>General questions:</strong> Start with the user’s life&#x2F;work habits and guide them into the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>In-depth questions:</strong> Deeply explore user needs.</li>
<li><strong>Concluding questions:</strong> You can ask users to summarize and supplement the discussion content to ensure that the user’s expression is received.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, recruiting users requires pre-establishing recruitment standards and the proportion of users of different types, choosing a venue requires cross-arranging seats for users with different backgrounds, and preparing materials including name tags, audio and video recording tools, etc., which will not be repeated.</p>
<p>In the implementation process after the preparation stage, there are the following links:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Introduction</strong></td>
<td>Moderator introduces themselves, the purpose of the focus group, and ground rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Discussion</strong></td>
<td>Moderator guides the discussion using the prepared questions, encouraging all participants to contribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Observation</strong></td>
<td>Assistant observes and records user behavior, interactions, and key comments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wrap-up</strong></td>
<td>Moderator summarizes the discussion and thanks participants.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the implementation phase, the overall discussion process requires assistants to observe and record user-related situations.</p>
<p>How to observe? It is necessary to observe the user’s attitude changes, the user’s product usage, and the user’s opposition. We can also use video recording to ensure the integrity of the video data with the user’s consent.</p>
<p>How to record? The user’s original words should be recorded verbatim, pay attention to the name and order of the speaker, and non-verbal behaviors should also be recorded. Here is also a small trick we use in the implementation process - sharing first-hand information using shared documents and other means. Why is this? In the research process, we often use a combination of various research methods, such as adding questionnaires to focus groups. Shared documents allow the interviewer to see the user’s answers for the first time, and guide the focus group based on the answers.</p>
<p>Focus groups are a commonly used qualitative research method, but the preparation and implementation process is somewhat complicated. Before we use it, we should clarify that we want to use focus groups instead of other methods, and what kind of information we want to obtain, so as not to complicate simple problems, and also to let focus groups play a greater role in suitable scenarios.</p>
