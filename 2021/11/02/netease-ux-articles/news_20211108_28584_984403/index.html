<p>Scrum, a concept applied in more and more fields, has now become a commonly used work management framework in various companies in the technology field, and game companies are no exception. Different from traditional project management, agile management uses an iterative approach to actively embrace changes and respond quickly to needs. How to build a more efficient team, how to speed up the product development process, and how to manage work schedules in an orderly manner are constantly being explored by every game product team.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Scrum"><a href="#1-What-is-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Scrum?"></a>1. What is Scrum?</h2><p>“Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.”</p>
<p>Scrum is a simple and easy-to-use framework for developing, delivering, and continuously supporting complex products. It is an incremental and iterative development process that helps teams and organizations break down complex problems to better produce work results.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint"><a href="#Sprint" class="headerlink" title="Sprint"></a>Sprint</h3><p>The entire development process consists of several short iteration cycles, and one iteration cycle is called a Sprint.</p>
<p>The length of a Sprint is generally controlled within one month, and the cycle needs to be fixed after it is determined. If the Sprint time is too long, the definition of what to build may change, the complexity may also increase, and the risk may increase. On the other hand, a fixed iteration cycle can help the team better review the work, discover problems, and make timely adjustments. Sprint achieves predictability by ensuring that progress towards goals is inspected and adapted at least once a month, while also limiting risk to one month’s cost. The entire Scrum team must create valuable and practical iterations in each Sprint. For games, the choice of Sprint cycle is a balance between development efficiency and response speed.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Backlog"><a href="#Product-Backlog" class="headerlink" title="Product Backlog"></a>Product Backlog</h3><p>The product backlog records the needs that the team needs to complete. Each Sprint needs to select the highest priority requirements for development. The selected requirements are discussed, analyzed, and estimated at the Sprint Planning Meeting to obtain a corresponding task list, called the Sprint backlog. These requirements must be delivered at the end of the Sprint. Usually, the Product Owner has the final say on the priority of the selected tasks.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Planning-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Planning-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Planning Meeting"></a>Sprint Planning Meeting</h3><p>A meeting to discuss and analyze requirements, and to select the highest priority requirements as the work content of the current Sprint.</p>
<h3 id="Daily-Scrum-Meeting"><a href="#Daily-Scrum-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Daily Scrum Meeting"></a>Daily Scrum Meeting</h3><p>A 15-minute daily meeting participated in by Developers in the team, usually held at the same time and place every day. If the PO and SM need to actively participate in the tasks of this Sprint, they also need to participate in the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to advance progress, arrange the work for the next day&#x2F;current day, and respond positively to existing problems.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Review-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Review-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Review Meeting"></a>Sprint Review Meeting</h3><p>An informal meeting for each Sprint, where the team will present the product or work output, and evaluate and propose ideas for the presentation results. This meeting is centered around the product.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Retrospective-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Retrospective-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Retrospective Meeting"></a>Sprint Retrospective Meeting</h3><p>A review meeting at the end of each Sprint. Different from the Review, the meeting will discuss the personnel and team’s work in the current Sprint, discuss the problems existing in the current work status, and propose improvement suggestions and measures. This meeting is an important part of the Scrum framework and helps to build, deliver, and manage complex projects more effectively.</p>
<p>The simple Scrum process is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2Feeae3d97-fe6e-4d0f-9309-0078231c65c5.png/size/" alt="Scrum Process Diagram"></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Scrum-Team"><a href="#2-The-Scrum-Team" class="headerlink" title="2. The Scrum Team"></a>2. The Scrum Team</h2><p>The Scrum team needs to have three necessary roles: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner (PO), and multiple Developers. Note that in this team, there are no branch teams or hierarchical relationships. The entire team focuses on the same goal, which is the Product Goal. Usually, a Scrum team needs to be controlled to a scale of no more than 10 people - small enough to maintain agility, and large enough to complete all important work in each Sprint.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Owner"><a href="#Product-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Product Owner"></a>Product Owner</h3><p>Generally served by a producer, lead planner, or dedicated assistant, responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team from the work of the Scrum team, and also responsible for effective Backlog management, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish and effectively communicate the Product Goal with the team;</li>
<li>Create and clearly express each task in the Product Backlog;</li>
<li>Reasonably prioritize the tasks in the Product Backlog;</li>
<li>Ensure that the Product Backlog is open, transparent, clear, and can be fully understood by team members;</li>
<li>Confirm the development of new features and the repair of BUGs.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Developers"><a href="#Developers" class="headerlink" title="Developers"></a>Developers</h3><p>A team composed of various personnel with different skills, spanning multiple positions, dedicated to completing various tasks in each Sprint. Taking games as an example, team members include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning, operations, programming, art, sound effects, testing, etc.;</li>
<li>The development team is formed and authorized by the organization, and the team needs to be responsible for and manage their own work.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Scrum-Master"><a href="#Scrum-Master" class="headerlink" title="Scrum Master"></a>Scrum Master</h3><p>Serves both the PO and the Developers, aiming to help the team provide solutions to problems during Scrum, remove obstacles, and let the team move in the right direction, acting as a coordinator, order maintainer, and manager. Therefore, it is generally served by a person in the team who is more prestigious and has deep experience. But different from the traditional PM, Developers are responsible for managing their own work, not supervised by the SM.</p>

<h2 id="3-An-Extension-of-a-Scrum-Team-SoS"><a href="#3-An-Extension-of-a-Scrum-Team-SoS" class="headerlink" title="3. An Extension of a Scrum Team - SoS"></a>3. An Extension of a Scrum Team - SoS</h2><p>As the game product progresses step by step, the members of the project team will continue to increase, and the team size will continue to increase. At this time, a Scrum team is obviously not enough to meet the needs. At this time, it is necessary to split the team and adopt the Scrum of Scrums framework.</p>
<p>SoS means that the Scrum Master of each team forms a small group to share the status of each team and respond to potential problems between teams in a timely manner. The SoS team lets all relevant personnel understand what is happening in other teams in the system, determines under what conditions teams need to help each other, determines under what conditions teams need to coordinate, and ensures that all personnel have the same understanding of a common product goal.</p>
<p>The SoS architecture diagram is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2F399e3211-8d19-4d8b-90cb-ee5d96cf1003.png/size/" alt="Scrum of Scrums Diagram"></p>
<h2 id="4-Game-Products-and-Scrum"><a href="#4-Game-Products-and-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="4. Game Products and Scrum"></a>4. Game Products and Scrum</h2><p>In the Internet era, change is the foundation of game survival. A game with a slow update frequency is likely to lose a large number of players in a short period of time. Chasing the ever-changing tastes of players, leading the new trend of the game circle, and creating higher gold-absorbing efficiency are all based on constant changes.</p>
<p>However, without planning and planning, too frequent changes are extremely unfriendly to software development - changes will lead to a lot of repetitive work, affect the development progress, or will have an impact on all completed work, bringing many unexpected jobs. The worst consequence is the internal contradictions caused by disputes over change issues, which affect the overall development progress of the product.</p>
<p>If classified according to whether the change requirements will have an impact on the current development work, it can be roughly divided into two categories: those that have a direct impact and those that do not have a direct impact. The former refers to the work that is being developed, tested, or processed by relevant developers, or that has entered the current iteration cycle to be processed. The latter is that the content related to this requirement is still in the planning stage and has not yet been sent to the developers. At this time, the change does not have a big impact on the current work. Most of the developers oppose the former. Therefore, the Scrum management model is very effective in this situation - with Sprint as a cycle, all work that is already in the current Sprint, whether it is being processed or to be completed, is not allowed to be changed. If it must be changed, then the current work can only be interrupted, the requirement can be removed from the development list, and after modification, it can be put into the next Sprint. If a modification requirement is put forward after the development is completed, it will be regarded as a new requirement, and it will also be scheduled in a future Sprint.</p>
<p>With the continuous increase in development costs, improving efficiency will become the key for game companies. Most companies can no longer afford the business models that will not be used in the end in game development, and they cannot wait until the end of the project to see if something is valuable. It is too late at that time, and the sunk cost will be very large. The main function of Scrum is to remove the bottleneck of wasting workload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because Scrum emphasizes communication and collaboration between teams and rapid response, incorporating QA into the team is a win-win situation for developers and players, and the burden of QA will be reduced compared with the past, avoiding the situation of accumulation. In this way, every bug will be fixed in time, thereby increasing the speed of content development.</p>
<p>Of course, when a company or a team decides to adopt Scrum’s agile management method, it must also face some new challenges.</p>
<p>The top-down hierarchical management culture is transformed into a team-based iterative culture - the change of management model is difficult at the beginning. For the team that uses Scrum to develop products for the first time, how to play their roles well is a challenge, and it is also a major change to get used to reflecting and adjusting according to the short cycle of a Sprint.</p>
<p>From assigning and supervising work to self-management - Scrum encourages teams to self-manage. Under this soft management model, the spontaneity and self-discipline of each team member are particularly important, and there needs to be a common goal and a consistent understanding of it. This also requires the cooperation of PO and SM, especially SM, who needs to take the lead.</p>
<p>In summary, Scrum is only a framework in the final analysis. Different teams, different Scrum Masters, and different Product Owners should set goals and manage work according to their own and product actual conditions, and find the most suitable and balanced agile management model.</p>
