<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Do you remember how we started a multiplayer journey in the game? Sometimes it’s a team invitation from a powerful friend, sometimes it’s a teammate recruitment shout in the public channel, and sometimes it’s just a stranger we meet in the open world with the same goal… In most multiplayer games, the team system is often an important part of the game’s social composition and is closely related to the player’s game experience - good teammates will bring a refreshing and pleasant experience, and at the same time enhance the positive social interaction between players and may develop into new friend relationships, that is, to obtain the joy of the game through a good cooperation.</p>
<p>From the player’s point of view, the team system is a natural connection between the battle and friend systems. When we analyze the underlying logic of the team system from the perspective of game design, we may find some more interesting design constructs.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Social-Ecology-of-Games"><a href="#1-The-Social-Ecology-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Social Ecology of Games"></a>1. The Social Ecology of Games</h2><p>First of all, what is the social ecology in the game? From the perspective of psychological design, the social ecology of the game is essentially a psychological need of players. In the classic Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Maslow divides human needs from low to high into physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs. Through a series of interactions such as environmental mapping and behavioral feedback in the game world, players can obtain a sense of belonging and self-esteem that transcends real time and space.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffc6c0412-deed-44e8-a5e2-e8427268840a.png/size/" alt="Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs."></p>
<p>From the perspective of game design, the team system, friend system and battle matching system can be combined to build a basic game social ecosystem. A good social ecosystem design can bring higher player retention and a more stable social relationship cycle to the game, thereby improving the overall revenue of the game.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-is-a-Team-System"><a href="#2-What-is-a-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="2. What is a Team System?"></a>2. What is a Team System?</h2><p>The team system is an important part of the game’s social ecosystem construction. It is closely related to the friend system and the battle matching system, two core systems.</p>
<p>The type of game and the characteristics of the core gameplay will also be reflected in the design of the team system. For example, some games pay more attention to matching cooperation (such as <em>Overwatch</em>), so its team system will pay more attention to functionality, while some games pay more attention to the fun of the gameplay (such as <em>Warframe</em>), so its team system will pay more attention to sociality and be more closely integrated with the friend system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unlike random matching that directly enters the battle, the team system allows players to form or join a team according to specific needs, and there will be an adjustment and consensus process within the team, so that players have a greater sense of belonging in cooperative battles. It is a process of finding and recognizing each other, and sometimes it can also avoid the problem of inappropriate position selection caused by random matching, which is different from the fast game experience of directly pulling players into the team through matching.</p>
<p>In general, a good team system can promote player socialization and enhance the game experience of battle cooperation, which has an important positive impact on player retention.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Based-Teaming"><a href="#Social-Based-Teaming" class="headerlink" title="Social-Based Teaming"></a>Social-Based Teaming</h3><p>At present, there are two main ways to team up in cooperative competitive games. One is to rely on the team-up method of friends, which is more social, but also more costly for players, because the team system limits the relationship between players and teammates to friends. The advantage is that the matching and cooperation experience between relatively familiar players is more stable and it is easy to enhance feelings; the disadvantage is that the cost of developing stranger friends is higher.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F5b38d977-199c-4cd4-97f3-c2b60b909b28.png/size/" alt="Example Image. Image shows a friends-based team system."></p>
<h3 id="Quick-Teaming"><a href="#Quick-Teaming" class="headerlink" title="Quick Teaming"></a>Quick Teaming</h3><p>Another way is an independent team system, which allows players to quickly join a team with the same mission goals through some filtering conditions, which is slightly weaker in sociality but more convenient. The advantage is that the game experience of cooperation is smoother and faster, and the cost of getting to know stranger friends is lower; the disadvantage is that it is relatively more likely to find inappropriate teammates, which affects the game experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F812bbf30-0942-4f82-a7b2-d47fabe76651.png/size/" alt="Example Image. Image shows a quick-team based system."></p>
<h2 id="3-Application-of-Team-System-in-Games"><a href="#3-Application-of-Team-System-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Application of Team System in Games"></a>3. Application of Team System in Games</h2><p>In practice, we will find that the team system in different games will be divided into two types of construction and classification: single-method teaming and composite-method teaming. This is because designers will build the team system according to the core gameplay of the game - games that focus on casual social gameplay will emphasize the sociality of teaming in the design, and such games can usually only be teamed up through friend invitations; on the other hand, games that focus on cooperative combat will pay more attention to the functionality of the team system in the design, and the priority is how to find the most suitable teammates for players. This team system is often composed of a combination of multiple methods.</p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Single-Method-Team-System"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Single-Method-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Single-Method Team System"></a>Characteristics of Single-Method Team System</h3><p>This teaming method completely relies on the friend system, and players can only form their own game team through friend invitations.</p>
<p>The advantage of this design is that it can better consolidate and promote the existing social relationship between players and friends, but the disadvantage is that it is more difficult to meet and develop new potential friends through team games.</p>
<h4 id="《APEX》"><a href="#《APEX》" class="headerlink" title="《APEX》"></a>《APEX》</h4><p>The teaming function of <em>APEX</em> is nested in the battle matching system and relies on the friend system. It is a very typical single-method team system.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffaed2b85-1789-495c-a3ca-938341e3b669.png/size/" alt="*APEX* Teaming Interface."></p>
<h4 id="《Battlefield-V》"><a href="#《Battlefield-V》" class="headerlink" title="《Battlefield V》"></a>《Battlefield V》</h4><p>Although the teaming function of <em>Battlefield V</em> is independent and permanently resident in the lower right corner of the game interface, it still relies on the friend system. It is also a very typical single-method team system.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fb1cb1cd1-8f6f-4e40-9307-11247128789b.png/size/" alt="*Battlefield V* Teaming Interface."></p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Composite-Method-Team-System"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Composite-Method-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Composite-Method Team System"></a>Characteristics of Composite-Method Team System</h3><p>In most game designs, social-based teaming and quick teaming are often combined to provide players with more diverse social choices, thereby improving the overall game experience.</p>
<h4 id="《Overwatch》"><a href="#《Overwatch》" class="headerlink" title="《Overwatch》"></a>《Overwatch》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, recently matched teammates&#x2F;opponents, independent team system</p>
<p>In <em>Overwatch</em>, players can form their own game team through three ways: friend list invitation, recently matched teammates&#x2F;opponents, and independent team system. The entire team system is very complete, with both sociality and convenience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F34fbfb0c-5c7e-4de4-9e07-ebb9ded0eb50.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ff4ff69e9-d960-4e7e-8cb9-2a642a5a857b.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fd50da56e-e49e-4782-b48e-028c9f033dd0.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."></p>
<h4 id="《Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened》"><a href="#《Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened》" class="headerlink" title="《Harry Potter: Magic Awakened》"></a>《Harry Potter: Magic Awakened》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, independent team system</p>
<p>The team system of the mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> also adds diversified teaming methods. Players can not only team up with friends, but also find suitable powerful teammates through wizard mutual assistance when encountering difficult levels, which reduces the possibility of players getting stuck and also broadens the social channels of the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F01a496e5-5ced-41f6-b230-627f893c86f7.png/size/" alt="*Harry Potter: Magic Awakened* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fa0a9c3b3-f33d-459e-9e43-581870a7cac9.png/size/" alt="*Harry Potter: Magic Awakened* Interface Examples."></p>
<h4 id="《Warframe》"><a href="#《Warframe》" class="headerlink" title="《Warframe》"></a>《Warframe》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, open world, public channel</p>
<p><em>Warframe</em> is more biased towards MMO in the construction of the social system - players can not only invite friends from the list to team up, but also invite strangers in the public channel and the open world to team up. In addition, its designer added the “Recently Met People” module to the social interface to record other players who recently played dungeons with the player, which also has a certain positive significance for promoting social interaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F11e23732-5856-453b-b6f7-0534b4678f75.png/size/" alt="*Warframe* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffcec48c3-7f17-4847-95ba-3e81a4ed951f.png/size/" alt="*Warframe* Interface Examples."></p>
<h2 id="4-Common-Summary"><a href="#4-Common-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Common Summary"></a>4. Common Summary</h2><p>In the design of the team interface, the main functions are composed of 6 interface elements: team information, team incentives, player invitation, game mode selection, team search, and filtering conditions. Different types of team system designs have different emphasis on presentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F51be01df-b2bd-476d-ad7f-d170daebda22.png/size/" alt="Example of a breakdown of the elements within a Teaming Interface."></p>
<p>On the other hand, in terms of the packaging form of page design, there are currently two mainstream forms: scene-based design and modular design. Scene-based design can give players a more immersive game experience, while modular design makes players’ operations more efficient. Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. As a designer, it is also necessary to consider the degree of fit between the packaging form and the overall tone of the game in specific projects.</p>

<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>In the world of multiplayer games, the design method of the team system is closely related to the core gameplay. Games that focus on casual social interaction often have a closer connection between their team system and the friend system; while games that focus on cooperative combat have a closer connection between their team system and battle matching.</p>
