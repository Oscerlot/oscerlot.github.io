</blockquote>
<p>The gameplay of Japanese female-oriented games (Otome Games) has now stabilized. According to Yano Research Institute, the market size of “female-oriented games” in Japan in 2015 was about 16.3 billion yen; it then fell slightly, maintaining at 15.5 billion yen in 2017. At the same time, the population of Japan in 2017 was about 130 million, the game population reached 68 million, of which mobile game players were about 54 million; in 2017, female mobile players in Japan accounted for 37.2%. Based on this, it is estimated that the ARPU value of Japanese female mobile players in the female-oriented game market is about 770 yen. The gameplay of female-oriented games is not limited to dress-up and story-watching, but also includes rhythm games, nurturing games, and other gameplay modes. Although the Japanese female-oriented mobile game market is booming, the fierce competition has also led to many mobile games experiencing a flash in the pan, ending service in less than half a year.</p>
<p>So why can some female-oriented mobile games be successfully operated for more than 5 years, while others end operations hastily? This article analyzes the reasons by compiling the Google Play and iOS store reviews of the long-lived and highly popular Japanese female-oriented games <em>Ensemble Stars!! Basic</em> and <em>Ensemble Stars!! Music</em> (Japanese name: あんさんぶるスターズ), and comparing them with the reviews of low-popularity and short-lived games such as <em>DREAM!ing</em>, <em>I-Chu</em>, and <em>MakeS</em>.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: There are nearly 50 characters in “Ensemble Stars!! Music”</em></p>

<h3 id="First-Character-Building"><a href="#First-Character-Building" class="headerlink" title="First: Character Building"></a>First: Character Building</h3><p>Among character building, the most mentioned by female players is voice actors, followed by character design. The maturity of the Japanese voice actor market gives Japanese female-oriented mobile game characters a variety of voices. Taking <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> as an example, more than 40 characters have their own unique voices. Whether it is the daily story dubbing or the singing at the concert, the voice actors give the paper figures the ability to speak and sing. The second is the character creation. <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> focuses on idol cultivation. There are dozens of characters, but each character has its own unique character setting. The character design is exquisite and beautiful, and the characteristics of different groups are distinct. There is the traditional Japanese musical instrument group “Akatsuki” and the cute and compact style “Ra*bits” group. Although there are many characters, there is no sense of repetition and aesthetic fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="Second-Game-Content"><a href="#Second-Game-Content" class="headerlink" title="Second: Game Content"></a>Second: Game Content</h3><p>The second point that Japanese female players pay attention to is the content in the game, which is mainly divided into plot, gameplay, and events. The plot mainly revolves around the campus and idols, unfolding a youthful dream-chasing story. The characters in the game are full and vivid. Take Tenshouin Eichi in the game as an example: Tenshouin Eichi is a sickly character. He is gentle, smart, observant, and considerate of his companions, but he is also good at manipulating everything behind the scenes. The conflict between hope and despair in the plot creates a Shakespearean-like dramatic character transformation in the emotional growth of the characters, and the performance of diverse characters.</p>

<p>Although it is a music game, <em>Ensemble Stars!! Music</em> has also achieved the greatest burden reduction. After clearing once, you can automatically play songs with one click, and at the same time you can enjoy the stage performance brought by the characters. From <em>Basic</em> to <em>Music</em>, the upgrade and update of the gameplay and the newly added characters have successfully captured the attention of old and new players. Not sticking to the existing gameplay and trying to innovate has created the history of Ensemble Stars!! dominating the female-oriented game charts.</p>
<p>Time-limited events that unfold with the timeline are also the focus of players’ attention. <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> arranges limited-time events reasonably according to time. Valentine’s Day, White Day, June Bride, fireworks festivals, etc. are all popular events. During the event, players can draw characters who unlock limited costumes through the gacha pool and read event-limited stories.</p>

<h3 id="Third-Game-Operation"><a href="#Third-Game-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Third: Game Operation"></a>Third: Game Operation</h3><p>Japanese female mobile game players will pour their emotions into their favorite virtual characters and become fans of a certain character. Therefore, a reasonable update speed operation will better grasp this group of fans with high game stickiness. In addition to limited-time events in the game, there are also welfare distributions, Twitter support, offline meetups, peripheral sales, cafe collaborations, and other activities. The large group of players and good retention, the prosperous development of game culture, are also conducive to the creation of game IP and the extension of game life.</p>
<h2 id="Comparison-of-Keywords-between-Popular-High-Popularity-Mobile-Games-and-Low-Popularity-Mobile-Games"><a href="#Comparison-of-Keywords-between-Popular-High-Popularity-Mobile-Games-and-Low-Popularity-Mobile-Games" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of Keywords between Popular High-Popularity Mobile Games and Low-Popularity Mobile Games"></a>Comparison of Keywords between Popular High-Popularity Mobile Games and Low-Popularity Mobile Games</h2><p>Among the popular mobile games, the top three words mentioned most by players are: characters, story plot, and no microtransactions; the most mentioned dissatisfaction points by players in low-popularity mobile games are: poor optimization, operational problems, and forced microtransactions. For <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em>, the keywords for its praise are mainly: good publicity, wide audience, good reputation, unique and personalized plot and characters, simple gameplay, and you can play happily without microtransactions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Japanese female-oriented mobile game market, in order to achieve long-term game operation, at least the following points must be met:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The game itself has a stable environment and good optimization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Game content and update speed that will not make users feel bored</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can enjoy the game without paying, and both paying players and non-paying players can get their own game pursuit goals in the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While doing the above three points, <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> also maintained good publicity channels. In addition to the official stable publicity, old users also brought new players to the game, so the game has a long life.</p>
