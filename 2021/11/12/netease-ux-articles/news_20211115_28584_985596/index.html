<p>APRG games, or Action Role-Playing Games, differ from typical RPGs in that they incorporate action elements, replacing the turn-based combat of RPGs with a more refined combat system. This enhances the gameplay in combat, attracting players who enjoy action games.</p>
<p>When discussing action games, it’s impossible to ignore the era of arcade dominance, when arcade halls were ubiquitous. It was during this time that most players were introduced to various action fighting games, such as <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</em>, and <em>Knights of Valour</em>. These classics became cherished childhood memories for many. Players, using joysticks and a few buttons, controlled characters to execute fantastic moves, captivating countless individuals. So, what experiences can players expect from ARPGs, which blend action and RPG elements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2Fbe9dc595-7c1e-42d6-a6ee-d8eb23fde3a0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;be9dc595-7c1e-42d6-a6ee-d8eb23fde3a0.png"></p>

<h2 id="1-Action-and-Strike-Feedback"><a href="#1-Action-and-Strike-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="1. Action and Strike Feedback"></a>1. Action and Strike Feedback</h2><p>In games featuring action elements, “strike feedback” (打击感 - dǎ jī gǎn) is a topic frequently discussed by players. Strike feedback originates from the game’s visual and auditory feedback to the player. Visual feedback includes animation, hit effects, hitstun, camera zoom and shake, as well as appropriate special effects and visible air disturbances. Auditory feedback requires appropriate sound effects, meaning sounds that match the materials colliding, with accurate sound source location and timing. For example, the sound of a sword hitting a rock should not be the sound of it hitting water. Failing to provide accurate auditory feedback significantly diminishes the player’s experience. The fluidity and coordination of moves in the game also affect the overall strike feedback. For instance, when a character moves, the limbs should bend in coordination with the steps. If the action designer has some martial arts foundation, they can better grasp the details of limb movements, providing players with more realistic visual feedback.</p>
<h2 id="2-PVE-Character-Progression-养成感-yang-cheng-gan"><a href="#2-PVE-Character-Progression-养成感-yang-cheng-gan" class="headerlink" title="2. PVE: Character Progression (养成感 - yǎng chéng gǎn)"></a>2. PVE: Character Progression (养成感 - yǎng chéng gǎn)</h2><p>With the development of the gaming industry and advancements in game styles, pure action games have a shrinking player base. Action is increasingly becoming just one element within a game. Action games have a certain skill barrier; not all players can achieve feats like no-hit runs, as some skilled action game players do. Most players have average skill levels, and improving technically is a painful process with often weak feedback. Players need to learn from constant failures, which can accumulate negative emotions. This is why many players who bought <em>Dark Souls 3</em> gave up before even defeating the first boss.</p>
<p>In early ACT games, there was no stat-based advantage, only a skill-based one. A player’s skill determined how far they could progress. However, ARPGs introduce stat progression. Characters can improve themselves by leveling up, acquiring better equipment and skills, or gaining various abilities. Defeating opponents might not strictly require these systems, but they make battles easier and faster, providing players with a sense of progression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2F5fb1a195-dae3-40a8-abf6-9ffcbfc5ed64.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;5fb1a195-dae3-40a8-abf6-9ffcbfc5ed64.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In 《NieR:Automata》, you can collect chips to enhance the protagonist.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The progression process is further amplified in online ARPGs. It leverages the player’s desire for constant improvement, encouraging them to invest time and effort in the game. By allowing players to win battles, or win more easily, a sense of becoming stronger is created, leading to satisfaction in the progression process.  However, this progression needs to be balanced. If a player’s stats completely overwhelm the game’s enemies, making skill irrelevant, it will quickly diminish the game’s playability. Once players become unstoppable “lawnmowers,” the fun of the game will quickly disappear.</p>
<h2 id="3-PVP-Game-Theory-博弈-bo-yi"><a href="#3-PVP-Game-Theory-博弈-bo-yi" class="headerlink" title="3. PVP: Game Theory (博弈 - bó yì)"></a>3. PVP: Game Theory (博弈 - bó yì)</h2><p>Many ARPG online games include both PVE and PVP content, with PVP attracting a significant audience.  While PVE emphasizes experiencing character progression and achieving victory, PVP emphasizes fair competition, where players triumph through strategic gameplay (博弈). The key difference is that players are facing real people, not AI. When discussing action PVP, many players might first think of combos. Indeed, stylish combos are a major source of enjoyment in PVP, but the core of PVP is actually game theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2F5eb041ed-1f58-45c6-99f3-e8a7dbe7ae37.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;5eb041ed-1f58-45c6-99f3-e8a7dbe7ae37.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In 《Street Fighter V》 high-level matches, there are full of probing and Game Theory.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If a player practices an unbeatable combo that can instantly defeat an opponent upon a successful hit, but lacks strategic ability, they won’t be able to land the combo in actual combat. They’ll be crushed by players who might not even have mastered combos but are skilled in actual combat.  Unlike traditional fighting games, ARPGs generally simplify skills into single button presses. Players don’t need to “input” complex commands to use skills; pressing a specific button executes the corresponding skill.  This further reduces the difficulty of performing combos and amplifies the role of game theory in combat.</p>
<p>Game theory in PVP encompasses all actions taken by both sides to gain a more advantageous position.  How to hit the enemy without being hit is the eternal challenge. Within the allotted time, the strategic interactions between players determine the victor. This includes controlling distance, predicting the opponent’s moves, baiting them into attacking, and so on – essentially, predicting the opponent’s predictions. In some online PVP battlegrounds, to ensure fairness, the game will implement balancing measures, reducing the influence of factors like player level, equipment, and other progression elements. However, these factors still play a role, giving high-spending players some room to exert their advantage.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Action elements provide players with the exhilarating thrill of combat. The progression system offers continuous feedback and a sense of satisfaction. PVP allows players to enjoy the strategic element of battling others. By mastering the key aspects of these elements, developers can capture the hearts of most ARPG players.</p>
