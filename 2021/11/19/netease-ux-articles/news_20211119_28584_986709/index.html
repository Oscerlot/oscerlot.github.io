<p>“Rockstar Games” is a game development subsidiary of the game publisher Take-Two Interactive. Many players may not be familiar with this company, but they must be very familiar with their most famous games, the <em>GTA</em> series and the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series. This New York-based video game company can be said to have produced many of the most famous video games of the 21st century. Games like the <em>GTA</em> series or the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series basically put players in a carefully designed open world. Whether it’s the American West in the late 18th and early 20th centuries, Miami in the 1980s, or Los Angeles (called Los Santos) in the 21st century, players can experience American life and Western culture at a specific time under the setting consistent with the real world. This article will take the <em>GTA</em> series and the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series as examples to briefly discuss the unique experience that players can get under the open world system created by Rockstar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F77300db9-5218-4deb-98c8-5fe20514b7fa.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;77300db9-5218-4deb-98c8-5fe20514b7fa.png"></p>

<h2 id="Walk-into-History-from-the-Plot-and-Feel-the-Epitome-of-Culture"><a href="#Walk-into-History-from-the-Plot-and-Feel-the-Epitome-of-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Walk into History from the Plot and Feel the Epitome of Culture"></a>Walk into History from the Plot and Feel the Epitome of Culture</h2><p>When talking about the setting of the plot and the background of the times in Rockstar games, it is inseparable from Dan Houser, one of the founders of R Star. He used to be the chief screenwriter of R Star (he resigned on March 11, 2020) and participated in writing the background settings of almost all <em>GTA</em> series and all <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series games. He once said in an interview, “The game may be a historical novel, but it is not a historical work.” Historical novels often leave a very deep impression on the public about historical figures or important historical periods, such as the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, which we are familiar with.</p>
<p>So what kind of American history does Rockstar’s game want to present to everyone? It is not difficult for us to find that basically every Rockstar game highlights the importance of crime in modern American history. Take the most classic <em>GTA: Vice City</em> as an example, the background setting is based on Miami in the 1980s. In the game, the protagonist Tommy Vercetti, played by the player, was imprisoned for 15 years for murder. After being released from prison, he gained connections and capital through various violent activities, and eventually became a prominent figure in “Vice City” by operating illegal industries under the guise of legality. Such a setting not only makes players feel excited, but also allows players to get a glimpse of two major characteristics of modern American history: greedy capitalism and serious gun violence. In almost all games in the <em>GTA</em> series, the characters played by players will use guns to create a world for themselves. It can be said that gun violence is the first perception of players when they first enter the game. At the same time, players can get a close look at the dark side behind the glamorous image of business tycoons through the plot, and then perceive greedy capitalism.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Avery Carrington, a representative of the bourgeois upper class in <em>GTA: Vice City</em>, a successful real estate tycoon. In the game plot, the protagonist played by the player will be appreciated by him, and help him complete some special tasks to obtain high rewards. Special tasks include triggering gang wars between Cubans and Haitians to drive down房价 (fángjià - house prices), intimidating and murdering construction teams that refuse to sell land to him, etc. The greedy Avery Carrington will use any means to seek profit, and almost every generation of the GTA series will create some greedy business tycoon images for players, so that players can perceive the dark side behind capitalism while experiencing the plot. In real American history, Miami has always been a port for the drug trade. In the 1980s, the “War on Drugs” made the city full of blood and violence. Drug trafficking and gang wars were led by criminal gangs from Cuba, Haiti, Colombia and other South American places. In 1980 alone, there were 573 murders in the city, and 621 murders the following year. In <em>GTA: Vice City</em>, the various events that players encounter in the game are actually the epitome of various conflicts in society at that time, and the various characters they encounter are representatives of various classes and people from different countries at that time. The social conflicts and the historical culture of that specific period were all presented in the game in a condensed way. While giving players sufficient freedom, it also allows players who are willing to calm down and appreciate the plot to feel the unique characteristics of the society at that time.</p>

<h2 id="In-Depth-Experience-of-Radio-Stations"><a href="#In-Depth-Experience-of-Radio-Stations" class="headerlink" title="In-Depth Experience of Radio Stations"></a>In-Depth Experience of Radio Stations</h2><p>Each radio station in the <em>GTA</em> game, just like in real life, not only plays different types of music for players, but also features some call-in talk shows. In addition to the music itself, what many domestic players are likely to miss are the contents of some radio advertisements and call-in broadcasts. Today, let’s talk about how this part of the experience creates a more humorous, complete and real world for players.</p>
<p>Some NPC characters in the game often appear in the <em>GTA</em> series radio call-in programs. Such Easter egg settings not only make the characters in the game more plump, but also stimulate players’ stronger desire to explore in the open world game. The advertisements interspersed in the radio station also echo the unique personality of the <em>GTA</em> series games, which is based on satire and humor. <em>GTA3</em> satirized the real lifestyle of Americans through advertisements on the game’s radio station. For example, a certain advertisement mentioned that a large company in the sports shoe industry used child labor, but Americans said they didn’t care. The game used this to satirize the real American society. <em>GTA: Vice City</em> also attempted to satirize the intellectual issues often discussed on NPR (National Public Radio) through the radio station VCPR. And the absurd spoof of <em>GTA3</em>‘s iconic radio talk show Chatterbox is one of the most memorable parts of the GTA series for foreign players. The content setting is basically a satirical commentary on American culture in the early 21st century. The talk show in the game will receive calls from people living in nearby areas. People can freely talk about anything they think of, and these contents will receive humorous comments from Lazlow (the radio host). For example, there was a call from a woman complaining about the negative impact of video games on children. The woman said, “Life is not like a game without a restart button.” The host Lazlow immediately replied, “Life doesn’t have one, but my hotline does,” and immediately hung up on the woman. American humorous answers like this abound in this show. This sudden “fun spoof” seems to make foreign players discover a “new continent”, making players involuntarily experience this novel and real radio style.</p>
<p>The radio stations in the <em>GTA</em> series not only add a basic entertainment function for players, but the above content is more to supplement a more complete and real world, so as to stimulate players’ stronger desire for autonomous exploration in the game. Ultimately, in open world games, the more content players perceive autonomously, the more fun they will get.</p>

<h2 id="Two-Way-and-Diverse-Interactive-Experience"><a href="#Two-Way-and-Diverse-Interactive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Two-Way and Diverse Interactive Experience"></a>Two-Way and Diverse Interactive Experience</h2><p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is Rockstar’s latest game after <em>GTA5</em>. Rockstar tried to make the open world of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> more realistic, and to make all actions in the game meaningful for players. When a player has an argument with a game NPC, the game provides some different interaction options. The player can threaten with a gun, shoot, or tie up with a rope. The player may only need to aggressively draw a gun and point it at him, and the NPC will stop unnecessary quarrels, of course, it may also be exchanged for the other party to draw a gun in self-defense. Therefore, the level of player experience becomes no longer binary, not just “Do I hit him or not?”. This way of interacting with NPCs in the game also depends on other factors: the player’s appearance, smell, reputation, and dress, etc. For example, if the player is wearing a neat cowboy outfit, then the interaction of passers-by will be relatively friendly. On the contrary, if the player is unkempt and covered in blood, then other people in the game will not want to have anything to do with you at all, and may even be scared to flee for fear of their lives. If a player has recently participated in a bar brawl and done something bad, a complete stranger will yell at the player, reminding people around him that the player did something bad not long ago. In the game, players can greet, threaten, or rob everyone in the world, so any character the player sees in the world is a potential interaction. The player’s every move in the world will give corresponding feedback. In a disguised way, all the player’s in-game behaviors are meaningful. Therefore, through two-way and diverse interaction methods, players can better experience the state of the character in the game world, and at the same time, they can express and understand more, more delicate and real emotions in the game.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Rockstar has developed and published a series of games that record modern American history, enabling players to feel the unique characteristics of the society at that time and some characteristics of American culture in the setting of the plot and background. Whether it is the radio station talk in the <em>GTA</em> series or the diversified interactive experience in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, it is to create a more real world, so that players can understand and express more real and delicate emotions. As much as possible, make all the player’s in-game behaviors more meaningful, so as to stimulate the player’s stronger desire for autonomous exploration in the open world game.</p>
