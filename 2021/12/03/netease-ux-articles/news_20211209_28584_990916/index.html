<p>Game design is an art, an art full of mystery. All artists will more or less give their works some small secrets, and game designers are no exception. These “little secrets” in the game are what we often call Easter eggs.</p>
<h2 id="I-What-are-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#I-What-are-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="I. What are Easter Eggs?"></a>I. What are Easter Eggs?</h2><p>Easter eggs are some interesting secrets hidden in the game that game makers deliberately leave for players during the game design process. They can be text messages, props, extra tasks, or other various strange designs. These seemingly irrelevant secret Easter eggs and hidden elements often play a key finishing touch.</p>
<p>Easter eggs are now almost standard in games. Developers are used to hiding things everywhere, and players can always find them all - as long as there are enough players of that game, nothing is impossible. Next, let’s count some interesting Easter eggs in the game.</p>
<h3 id="The-“Clay-Figure”-Item-in-Justice-Online"><a href="#The-“Clay-Figure”-Item-in-Justice-Online" class="headerlink" title="The “Clay Figure” Item in Justice Online"></a>The “Clay Figure” Item in <em>Justice Online</em></h3><p>Many <em>Justice Online</em> players will have the [Clay Figure] item. The item description says: Right-click me one hundred times and I will level you up. Many players clicked 100 times and did not level up. In fact, this is a prank Easter egg.</p>

<h2 id="II-Why-Have-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#II-Why-Have-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="II. Why Have Easter Eggs?"></a>II. Why Have Easter Eggs?</h2><p>The earliest game Easter egg was designed by a programmer named Warren Robinett. Due to his dissatisfaction with the company Atari’s oppressive policies, he designed a hidden level in the game, which wrote Created By Warren Robinett. After this Easter egg was discovered, the company could no longer recall the game cartridges due to cost and public opinion. They could only make the best of a bad bargain. They let the existing products be, and told interested players that their future games would have such small secrets, just like Easter eggs, for players to find and enjoy.</p>
<p>In the early days, the graphics of games were extremely simple. If you wanted to make some “hidden content”, you could only directly manipulate the code. With the advancement of technology, Easter eggs have become an important part of the game today, and their forms are also diverse and changeable. So why should there be Easter eggs in games?</p>
<p>People need motivation to achieve certain needs, and some needs take precedence over others. This is what we most often call the five levels of needs: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization. After satisfying the most basic deficiency needs, we step into the higher-level growth needs, that is, the satisfaction in the spiritual form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2Fcde91a0f-c752-4b2d-b490-b2a53a7eddf6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211209&#x2F;cde91a0f-c752-4b2d-b490-b2a53a7eddf6.png"></p>
<p>Correspondingly, for games, it can be divided into four levels from low to high: functionality, reliability, usability, and pleasure. The top level, “pleasure”, includes the emotional needs in the theory of human needs.</p>
<p>Compared with other Internet products, games should pay more attention to the entire process and gradual experience of player experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2F29ed2ff1-52ae-4fa6-82c7-51d827251ff0.png/size/" alt="Functionality, Reliability, Usability and Pleasure"></p>
<p>The experience design of Internet products pays more attention to usability and needs to help users achieve their goals smoothly. For games, it is necessary to bring surprises to players and prevent them from playing the game in a rigid manner. An unchanging game will keep the player’s emotional fluctuations within a relatively stable range. A fun game will inevitably bring changes in the player’s experience. In other words, in addition to usability, the game experience must start from the player’s motivation and emotion. After ensuring the most basic usability, it is necessary to make players’ emotions change and try to add points in terms of pleasure.</p>
<p>And Easter eggs bring this kind of added surprise.</p>
<p>When players have expectations for the game, if the results during the experience far exceed expectations, players will have a strong sense of surprise. Making players’ seemingly impossible wishes come true also creates positive emotional experiences such as a sense of surprise. A sense of surprise is a particularly emotional element, and it is difficult for players to separate it when they experience the game.</p>
<p>Adding some relatively “clever” designs to the game will also make it easier for players to feel surprised. When the player is playing and then sees an Easter egg, they can’t help but laugh and say, “Oh, look at this designer.” Sometimes, such a small Easter egg may be enough to touch the player and make them resonate emotionally with the game.</p>
<p>For game designers, if they add some of their own elements when making a game, such as Easter eggs, then the designer will have a more personal connection with this game and will also be more attentive to it. It’s like it’s their own game, not just a development project they’re involved in. The same is true for players. As mentioned above, emotional resonance. As a player, when I find Easter eggs in a game, the game has a special meaning to me. I can feel the real traces left by the developers behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="III-How-to-Design-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#III-How-to-Design-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="III. How to Design Easter Eggs"></a>III. How to Design Easter Eggs</h2><p>However, due to the hidden nature of Easter eggs, it is difficult to guarantee that players will definitely see these attempts at emotional resonance, which also creates great cost pressure. For a game, how to design Easter eggs becomes a problem.</p>
<p>From the perspective of user experience, the following factors need to be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the right time and place according to the type of game. It should not affect the main process, nor should it make users feel out of place or unable to find it.</li>
<li>Pay attention to players to find design inspiration. Different players have different needs. Understand what players want and what are the extra points, so that the designed Easter eggs are valuable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current mainstream design methods include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<h3 id="Homage-Developers-use-Easter-eggs-to-pay-tribute-to-classic-games"><a href="#Homage-Developers-use-Easter-eggs-to-pay-tribute-to-classic-games" class="headerlink" title="Homage: Developers use Easter eggs to pay tribute to classic games"></a>Homage: Developers use Easter eggs to pay tribute to classic games</h3><p>Developers are originally game players. The game production process is actually a reproduction of the developers’ ideas, and the ideas themselves are largely derived from other games. Whether it is the game of the project team next door or the masterpiece of other companies, if these game experiences have more or less influenced the developers, it is also a good way to express respect by bringing some of their signs into the game.</p>
<h3 id="Explore-the-game-world-and-plot"><a href="#Explore-the-game-world-and-plot" class="headerlink" title="Explore the game world and plot"></a>Explore the game world and plot</h3><p>Use Easter eggs to bury details throughout the game process, leaving them for players to discover and discuss. If the Easter eggs are designed properly, the player’s desire to explore can provide more online time for the game. In addition to spending time on the main line, players will also spend time exploring the game world. Once players find an Easter egg, they will feel that the game world is suddenly enlightened. To a certain extent, Easter eggs make the game world appear larger, encouraging players to explore carefully everywhere instead of taking a quick glance.</p>
<h3 id="Unexpected-interactions"><a href="#Unexpected-interactions" class="headerlink" title="Unexpected interactions"></a>Unexpected interactions</h3><p>This type of Easter egg usually does not follow the usual rules to bring an unexpected experience, making players exclaim “Can it be like this?”</p>
<p>It gives people an unexpected feeling, exceeding players’ expectations of the original content. Players will think, “Wow, there must be more of this kind of stuff,” and the game therefore appears to be richer.</p>
<h3 id="Self-promotion-of-the-game"><a href="#Self-promotion-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Self-promotion of the game"></a>Self-promotion of the game</h3><p>The human touch and gameplay revealed in the Easter eggs are actually a promotion of the game itself. In layman’s terms, it is to make players feel the conscience of this game.</p>
<p>If the Easter egg is designed with enough depth, it will naturally drive operational interaction outside the game. Players may discuss various details in the game on online forums or offline, thereby generating unexpected promotional effects for the game.</p>
<p>Easter eggs are like chiseling carefully on a piece of marble without knowing whether anyone can observe these strokes, but a wonderful work of art has already been carefully crafted.</p>
