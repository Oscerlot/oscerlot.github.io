</blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s, early game media appeared in the players’ field of vision in the form of newspapers and magazines. At that time, game players had a single source of information and did not have a good opportunity to voice their opinions. Game media reviews of games largely influenced players’ game choices. With the rise of the Internet and modern social platforms, players have more information channels and can freely express their opinions on the Internet or game platforms. As a result, more and more players find that those highly-rated games often fail to bring them a good gaming experience. Where is the problem with the loss of “discourse power” in media reviews?</p>
<h2 id="1-Starting-with-the-Failure-of-Deathloop"><a href="#1-Starting-with-the-Failure-of-Deathloop" class="headerlink" title="1. Starting with the Failure of Deathloop"></a>1. Starting with the Failure of <em>Deathloop</em></h2><p>On Black Friday 2021, <em>Deathloop</em>, which had just been released for two months, started its 50% discount, ruthlessly backstabbing the pre-order players who mocked themselves as “stupid and rich”.</p>
<p>For game manufacturers, it is not a good thing to start a large discount too early. Because it not only hurts the hearts of those pre-order players (they are often the core fans of the game), but also reveals a dangerous signal: game sales may have begun to weaken, and the number of active players is at stake.</p>
<p><em>Deathloop</em>‘s current state is pretty much like this.</p>
<p>When the media review embargo was lifted on September 13, <em>Deathloop</em> was in the limelight. Metacritic media score was 88, and two major media outlets, IGN and GameSpot, gave full marks. Many media outlets were full of praise. However, after the game was officially released, many players found that the game was not as good as the media described. Frequent game crashes, endless annoying bugs, poor PC optimization, and an anti-cheat mechanism that was almost non-existent made the game’s advantages in level design and art style disappear - after all, if the game cannot even be entered, who cares how amazing your level design is?</p>
<p>Angry players expressed their dissatisfaction with the game with ratings and sales: Metacritic player score 4.8, mostly positive on Steam, forming a sharp contrast with previous media reviews. The game only briefly topped the Steam weekly sales chart based on initial media reviews, and then quickly “faded into obscurity”. The number of daily active players also dropped from the initial 20,000+ to less than 2,000 now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F3961afc8-b30d-403d-87e5-56f989447b5a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;3961afc8-b30d-403d-87e5-56f989447b5a.png"></p>

<p><em>As of December 1, Deathloop’s Metacritic media score was 86, and the player score was 4.8</em></p>

<h2 id="2-Where-is-the-Disagreement"><a href="#2-Where-is-the-Disagreement" class="headerlink" title="2. Where is the Disagreement?"></a>2. Where is the Disagreement?</h2><p>The problems encountered by <em>Deathloop</em> are not an isolated phenomenon. The divergence between media reviews and player experience has long been evident. However, in previous years, most of the hardest-hit areas were concentrated in some annual games, such as <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA2K</em>. What really detonated the confrontation between players and the media was a tragedy caused by a golf club. Since then, the crisis of confidence between media ratings and player experience has intensified. “Trust the media for low scores, trust yourself for high scores”, “IGN, even dogs don’t watch it”, “Famitsu? Paid-tsu!”, more and more players use such simple and crude sentences to directly express their dissatisfaction with media reviews.</p>
<p>The loss of credibility of game media is ultimately due to the inherent limitations of its evaluation mechanism. Long-term operation of the game, performance problems, and paid in-app purchases are often the points of divergence between media reviews and player experience.</p>
<h3 id="Long-term-Operation-“Five-Years-of-Sharpening-a-Sword”"><a href="#Long-term-Operation-“Five-Years-of-Sharpening-a-Sword”" class="headerlink" title="Long-term Operation: “Five Years of Sharpening a Sword”"></a>Long-term Operation: “Five Years of Sharpening a Sword”</h3><p>Media evaluates the basic quality of the game at the time of release, that is, the short-term experience, while the player’s evaluation runs through the entire life cycle, that is, it also includes the long-term operating experience.</p>
<p>Most of the current game ratings are based on the media review version submitted一段时间 before the game is released. However, players’ experience of the game will run through the entire life cycle of the game, especially for some long-term online games. Therefore, the later operation of the game is also an important part of the player’s game experience.</p>
<p>There are not a few games that have good basic qualities but are dragged down by subsequent operations, such as <em>Battlefield 5</em> (meta score 81, player score 2.9), which has stopped updating. Of course, there are also games that have made a beautiful comeback with the subsequent operation of the game. The most well-known to players should be <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, which was full of negative reviews when it was just released, with an MC score of only 61. Highly repetitive gameplay, incomplete game completion, and deceptive marketing made this game fall to the bottom in terms of both player reviews and media reviews when it was just released. However, after five years of consistent free updates, the problems that the developer promised to solve have been solved as scheduled. Looking back at <em>No Man’s Sky</em> now, it may be difficult to imagine that this now “overwhelmingly positive” game was once mockingly called “No Man’s Hole” by domestic players.</p>

<p><em>《No Man’s Sky》 From Mostly Negative reviews in the early days to Overwhelmingly Positive reviews now</em></p>

<h3 id="Performance-Issues-2077-Bugs"><a href="#Performance-Issues-2077-Bugs" class="headerlink" title="Performance Issues: 2077 Bugs"></a>Performance Issues: 2077 Bugs</h3><p>When <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was just released in 2020, at least half of the negative reviews of the game were focused on the game’s bugs and optimization problems. And <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also “kindly” called “Cyberbug 2077” by players because of the numerous bugs. If the PC version only had a lot of bugs, then the console version was not like a finished game at all. A large number of frame drops, crashes, and texture problems caused a large number of players to request refunds just one week after the game was released, and it was even directly removed from the PS store. However, interestingly, such frequent and serious bugs did not significantly affect the media’s evaluation of 2077. When 2077’s media score was first lifted, it once won a high score of MC91.</p>
<p>Perhaps for game media, the occurrence of game bugs is understandable, but for players, a smooth game flow is obviously an important part of their game experience.</p>
<p>The media may not want to ignore the deeper design concept and subsequent development potential of the game because of game bugs. But as with the same problems encountered by <em>Deathloop</em>, no one likes to have 2077 bugs in their game, nor do they like to play a crash loop. The huge impact of these problems on the player’s game experience cannot be saved by excellent game design.</p>
<h3 id="Buy-to-Play-In-App-Purchases-“Pay-to-Win”"><a href="#Buy-to-Play-In-App-Purchases-“Pay-to-Win”" class="headerlink" title="Buy-to-Play In-App Purchases: “Pay to Win”?"></a>Buy-to-Play In-App Purchases: “Pay to Win”?</h3><p>The media’s tolerance for buy-to-play in-app purchases is often higher than that of players.</p>
<p><em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</em>, published by Warner, was obviously not significantly affected by the microtransaction system in the game in terms of media ratings. However, this work, which scored 90 points on IGN and an average MC score of 75 points (the MC score was once above 85 points when it was just released), still aroused the anger of players (MC player score 4.2) due to its microtransaction system, forcing the game to remove the in-app purchase system a few months later.</p>
<p>The buy-to-play + in-app purchase payment model is not uncommon in recent years. <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are all such payment models. For the media, the bottom line of in-app purchases is often that they do not seriously affect the game balance. Adding some in-app purchase elements to a single-player buy-to-play game cannot be an important factor in giving the game a low score. At most, a few points will be deducted to discourage this form. But for players, just not affecting the game balance cannot be a death-free gold medal for buy-to-play in-app purchases. Any in-app purchases that “pay to win” and increase the game’s grind to force purchases are likely to arouse players’ anger. Therefore, even for games like <em>Middle-earth</em>, which are biased towards single-player, it is difficult for players to accept paying to quickly improve their strength, let alone those games that focus on online play and can be “pay to win” to some extent (such as <em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em>).</p>

<h2 id="3-Lessons-from-Others"><a href="#3-Lessons-from-Others" class="headerlink" title="3. Lessons from Others"></a>3. Lessons from Others</h2><p>Game media is not unaware of this problem. For example, IGN will re-modify the previous evaluation after a major game update. However, if you want to truly fit the player’s game experience, future game media may need to be more “UX” oriented: listen to more feedback from test players, rather than relying solely on a few senior editors; give higher evaluation weight to player experience-oriented content, rather than just mentioning it briefly; adopt long-term tracking-style scoring research, rather than “stopping at the point” when it is released. Then perhaps the crisis of confidence between players and the media is not an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>For User Research, the following points need to be achieved:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>While paying attention to the basic quality of the game, attach importance to the long-term operation of the game;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider how to help the game establish a more agile and systematic performance problem early warning mechanism;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explore payment methods that players can accept.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is also a lesson from the crisis of confidence between media and players.</p>
