</blockquote>
<p>Wuxia is a fairy tale for adults, Wuxia is the fantasy of the East, and Wuxia is a real world. Games based on Wuxia generally have rich storylines and continue to deliver the dream of wielding a sword and roaming the Jianghu with pleasure. In Vietnam, which is closely linked with China, there is still the romantic gene of Wuxia culture, and Wuxia-themed games are enduring. In the daily communication of ordinary Vietnamese people, there will also be metaphors like “as hypocritical and sinister as Yue Buqun.” It is undeniable that Vietnam has been deeply influenced by Wuxia culture.</p>
<p>This article hopes to analyze the Wuxia culture and Wuxia-themed games in Vietnam to answer the following two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the Vietnamese perception of Wuxia?</li>
<li>How is the development of Wuxia-themed games in Vietnam?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-The-“Wuxia-Craze”-that-Swept-Across-Generations"><a href="#1-The-“Wuxia-Craze”-that-Swept-Across-Generations" class="headerlink" title="1. The “Wuxia Craze” that Swept Across Generations"></a>1. The “Wuxia Craze” that Swept Across Generations</h2><p>Wuxia culture entered Vietnam in the early 20th century, when Vietnam was becoming a French colony, and the colonists tried to transform the original Vietnamese language into pinyin. By coincidence, the Vietnamese readers of Chinese classical Wuxia novels were no longer limited to Confucian scholars who had received Chinese education, but expanded to people of all classes who mastered the national language. After the Wuxia novel craze in Vietnam, Vietnamese writers began to become self-sufficient. In 1920, Nguyễn Chánh Sắt wrote <em>Hiệp Lữ</em>, which was also the first Wuxia novel in Vietnamese national language literature. <em>Hiệp Lữ</em> was warmly welcomed by readers as soon as it was published, and under the guidance of this work, a wave of Wuxia novel creation was set off.</p>
<p>After that, in just over 20 years from 1954 to 1975, a large number of works by Chinese Hong Kong and Taiwan Wuxia novel writers such as Jin Yong, Gu Long, Liang Yusheng, Wolong Sheng, and Zhuge Qingyun were translated into Vietnamese, which greatly influenced the artistic taste of several generations of Vietnamese people. It has been more than 100 years since Chinese Wuxia novels were spread to Vietnam, and now the footprints and influence of Wuxia culture in Vietnam are everywhere. Works with Wuxia as the theme are very popular in Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id="2-Vietnamese-People’s-Perception-of-“Wuxia”"><a href="#2-Vietnamese-People’s-Perception-of-“Wuxia”" class="headerlink" title="2. Vietnamese People’s Perception of “Wuxia”"></a>2. Vietnamese People’s Perception of “Wuxia”</h2><p>In Vietnamese, Wuxia is usually directly translated as Võ hiệp (武侠) or kiếm hiệp (剑侠). The definition of Wuxia in the Vietnamese dictionary is an ancient warrior who is good at swordsmanship and often does good deeds and helps the weak (Võ sĩ thời xưa, giỏi đánh kiếm, thường làm nghĩa, cứu giúp bênh vực kẻ yếu). This is almost similar to the domestic understanding of “Wuxia”.</p>
<p>The classic Wuxia story understood by Vietnamese people is like this: the male protagonist needs to experience tragedies such as the murder of his family, go through thousands of hardships and unbearable hardships, and learn various martial arts from many masters. In this process, he will quietly dormant, hide his name, and wait for various opportunities to prove himself in front of those who look down on him. At the end of the story, the male protagonist becomes an unmatched martial arts master, he constantly refines his skills and dominates the Jianghu. The eight common Wuxia characteristics are selflessness, justice, independence, loyalty, bravery, trustworthiness, not caring about money and reputation.</p>
<p>Vietnamese people can also be compatible with and understand the concepts of Wuxia works, such as martial arts, weapons (knives, swords, sticks, spears, abacus, fans, pens, pipes, or various musical instruments are all kinds of weapons familiar to Vietnamese people), Qinggong, internal strength, acupuncture, etc.</p>

The History of Wuxia-Themed Games Going Overseas to Vietnam"></a>3. The History of Wuxia-Themed Games Going Overseas to Vietnam</h2><p>Games with Wuxia as the background have always performed well in the Vietnamese video game market. From the earliest <em>JX Online</em> (Vietnamese version named “Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ”) and <em>Kiếm Thế</em>, to the endless stream of Wuxia-themed games such as <em>New Swordsman M</em> (一梦江湖), <em>Legend of Fire</em> (烈火), etc., the Wuxia background is not unfamiliar to Vietnamese players.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> (JX Online) can be said to be the most influential game in the history of Vietnamese video games. <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> is a very classic MMORPG game with a sect system, task system, item enhancement&#x2F;refining system, life system and large-scale PVP siege warfare.</p>
<p>In April 2005, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> became the first online role-playing game with a Wuxia theme in Vietnam, “opening the door” for the later development of this series of games. The publisher of the game at that time was VinaGame (the predecessor of VNG). Immediately, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> became a popular online game. According to statistics, in just about half a year, the game had 4.7 million active accounts, accounting for about 85% of the game community at that time. It is worth mentioning that in 2005, Vietnam had only 19.7 million Internet users. At its peak, it occupied 80% of the Vietnamese game market. <em>JX Online</em> is also the earliest online game in the Vietnamese market that is charged by time.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ is popular in Vietnam</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> takes the Southern Song Dynasty of China as the game background, allowing players to seem to feel the national hatred and family hatred at that time in the game. Although the game screen can no longer be compared with today’s Wuxia online games, it makes players more immersive. In addition, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> achieved very high-quality offline player contact and community management in the early 2000s, and the folk also organized a lot of offline gatherings. From 2005 to 2006, Vinagame held offline Vo Lam Congresses to organize game players and established the first inter-server online game tournament in Vietnam, the First Bang Thien Ha tournament.</p>

What do Vietnamese Players Pursue When Entering the World of Wuxia?</h2><p>By observing and collecting feedback and comments on Wuxia-themed games on the market, we can get a glimpse of the goals of Vietnamese players when experiencing Wuxia games.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(In this game) I can talk to Dongfang Bubai and Bodhidharma! These are characters from previous novels, it’s so novel.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Now there are very few games that include all the moves mentioned in Jin Yong’s novels. I think this is very well done</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This game has very exciting siege battles, and this kind of large-scale battle is too spectacular.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I like the costumes and face pinching inside.</li>

<hr>
<p><em>When “New Swordsman M” (一梦江湖) was released in Vietnam, face pinching was loved by players.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From an observational point of view, there is no obvious difference between Vietnamese players and Chinese players in the preference of Wuxia-themed games. This also explains why many Chinese Wuxia games have achieved fruitful results when they go overseas to Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is the similarity of history or the spread of culture, Vietnamese players have a natural affinity for games with Wuxia as the background. They can understand the background and terminology in Wuxia, and their preferences for Wuxia are very similar to those of Chinese players. It can be said that Vietnam is another fertile land for Wuxia-themed culture. In the game world of galloping horses and swords, Vietnamese players are also pursuing their own Wuxia dreams.</p>
