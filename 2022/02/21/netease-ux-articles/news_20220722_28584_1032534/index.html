<p>“Grindy” is the most common complaint players have about games. Every player has a few memes in their phone complaining about how grindy a game is. Although players resonate so much with the topic of “grind”, what exactly do they mean by grind? Are they even talking about the same thing? Is grind simply referring to the length of time spent playing the game? Is it an objective time consumption or is it mixed with the influence of subjective perception? When developers receive feedback from players that “the game is too grindy”, they often fall into the dilemma of whether to modify the gameplay time. It seems that once players complain about grind, there are only two options: stick to it or shorten the time. This article will reveal the truth of “grind” from a psychological perspective.</p>
<h2 id="1-Who-is-Fluctuating-the-Player’s-Inner-Clock"><a href="#1-Who-is-Fluctuating-the-Player’s-Inner-Clock" class="headerlink" title="1. Who is Fluctuating the Player’s Inner Clock?"></a>1. Who is Fluctuating the Player’s Inner Clock?</h2><h3 id="Introduction-to-Time-Perception-and-Factors-Affecting-Time-Perception"><a href="#Introduction-to-Time-Perception-and-Factors-Affecting-Time-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Time Perception and Factors Affecting Time Perception"></a>Introduction to Time Perception and Factors Affecting Time Perception</h3><p>“Grind” (肝 - gān) refers to spending a lot of time and energy playing games, and it gets its name from the fact that staying up late is bad for the liver. There is also a rumor that a certain old brother stayed up late playing games and eventually developed liver cirrhosis, and his friends in the game joked that he should pay attention to his liver. Before analyzing the problem of “grind”, we must first understand how time is perceived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F11fae990-60bf-4975-b665-1a0e3d2722cd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;11fae990-60bf-4975-b665-1a0e3d2722cd.jpg"></p>
<p>Time perception refers to our cognition of the duration and sequence of objective things and events. Unlike sight, hearing, touch and other senses, humans do not have specific organs to perceive time, and time perception is not a function of a single sensory channel. In other words, time perception is actually a subjective perception of people, a process of integrating fragments of the surrounding environment in an “appropriate way”.</p>
<p>Psychological theory believes that people judge the length of time based on two factors: external and internal. External factors include the rising and setting of the sun, the alternation of day and night, and timing tools; internal factors are the physiological and psychological activities of the human body, and the regular activities of the body can also be used as a basis for people to perceive time, such as the biological clock.</p>
<p>But the clock in people’s hearts is often not consistent with the real time, that is, a time illusion occurs. To give a simple example, with the same two hours, when you play a game you like, you will feel that time flies by, and you may even miss dinner; but if you watch a bad movie, you will feel that every minute is like sitting on pins and needles.</p>
<p>So what factors affect time perception?</p>
<p>Studies have shown that emotions, attention, personal interests and life experiences, and the amount of event content all affect time perception. In general, ① when people are in a relaxed and happy mood, they will estimate the time to be shorter, but when they are in a state of anxiety, anger, and pain, they will estimate the time to be longer; ② when people face things they are interested in, they will feel that time passes quickly, and when they face things they are not interested in, they will feel that time passes slowly; ③ when people are fully engaged in something, they will forget the passage of time, but if attention is focused on time information, you will feel like a day is like a year; ④ within a certain period of time, the more and richer the number of things that happen, the more complex the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be shorter; and when facing fewer things and the simpler the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be longer. In addition, vision is more susceptible to external influences than hearing, etc., and is less accurate in judging time.</p>
<h2 id="2-Common-Misconceptions-about-“Grind”"><a href="#2-Common-Misconceptions-about-“Grind”" class="headerlink" title="2. Common Misconceptions about “Grind”"></a>2. Common Misconceptions about “Grind”</h2><h3 id="Grindy-games-do-not-equal-games-that-take-a-long-time"><a href="#Grindy-games-do-not-equal-games-that-take-a-long-time" class="headerlink" title="Grindy games do not equal games that take a long time"></a>Grindy games do not equal games that take a long time</h3><p>Back to the question of grind, we already know that time perception is not equal to actual physical time, and “grind” is a kind of subjective time perception of players, so when players say “the game is grindy”, it does not necessarily mean that the game actually takes a long time, but “I think” it takes a long time.</p>
<p>However, in the actual game development process, developers tend to equate grind with long time consumption. It seems that shortening the length of the gameplay can alleviate players’ complaints, but this is actually a mistake of “treating the symptoms but not the root cause”. For example, a certain MMORPG has been operating for many years, and its daily guaranteed tasks have always been criticized by players as being too time-consuming. At this time, how should the game user researcher conduct follow-up research? The conventional idea is that we will find players and break down which part of which gameplay players think is time-consuming, what kind of optimization players want, and what is the maximum length of time they can accept. But this plan actually ignores one point - in the past few years of the game’s operation, the daily time has not become longer, and may even have become shorter, so even if the gameplay is further shortened, the negative feedback cannot be solved from the root. The background of players’ complaints about long time consumption is that they have been playing this gameplay repeatedly for several years, and they no longer need any thinking or operation. The real problem of long time consumption does not point to time, but to the above-mentioned “simple stimulus events, decreased interest, and attention focused on time information”.</p>

Analysis of several types of grind"></a>How should we understand it? Analysis of several types of grind</h3><p>Precisely because time perception is affected by a variety of factors, different players’ feedback on “grind” often has different reasons, so the “grind” that everyone complains about may not be the same thing at all! Players often express “grind” in these forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been running back and forth, can’t there be a means of transportation? I feel like I’m wasting my time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are twenty daily tasks, and some of them are only open for a limited time. I have to keep watch at a fixed time. It’s too time-consuming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Each round I have to fight five waves of the same mobs, it’s very boring. After finishing one wave, I have to wait for the next wave. Can this task be canceled?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are many weapons that haven’t been collected yet, and hidden side quests that haven’t been unlocked. These really take time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This game is so grindy, I keep saying ‘one more turn and then I’ll go to sleep’, and then the sun comes up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>……</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F60854268-e782-40c5-93a6-1633c7fe0b81.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;60854268-e782-40c5-93a6-1633c7fe0b81.jpg"></p>
<p>Some of these feedbacks need to be brought to the attention of developers, while others may not constitute a serious problem.</p>
<p>(1) The first kind of feedback points to the problem of repeating an operation, which is then perceived as a meaningless waste of time. This is the “grind” that players most often criticize. Studies have shown that repetition can improve people’s fluency in processing information, but when it reaches extremely fluency, people will start to get bored. The negative emotions of boredom will further stretch people’s perceived length of time. Therefore, even if the time is actually shortened due to increased proficiency, people will feel that it takes longer. Interestingly, a large number of repetitions in a short period of time will cause boredom and fatigue, but long-term repetition will not. This may explain why weekly dungeons are not often criticized by players, but repeating 30 daily loops at a time is strongly rejected by some people.</p>
<p>(2) It is worth noting in the second feedback that if the rules, output, or progress of the task are uncertain, and players cannot predict or control the time consumption, it is easy to feel grindy in the waiting. For example, in game matching, if only the matching is prompted, but there is no specific upper limit of the matching time, players are more likely to perceive the matching time as long. In the newly launched gameplay, if there is no clear explanation of each stage and progress of the gameplay, players are also more likely to feel that they have nothing to do, and then quit the gameplay midway.</p>
<p>(3) In the third feedback, “very boring” indicates that the gameplay content may not have aroused the player’s interest. When players face gameplay that they are not interested in but have to do for rewards, they are more likely to feel that the task takes a long time. When not interested, players’ attention to the task is also easily focused on time information, that is, how long the task will take and how long it will take me to complete it, rather than on the task itself, which will further lengthen the player’s time perception.</p>
<p>“Each round I have to fight five waves of the same mobs” suggests that the task itself is relatively simple, and the operational difficulty for players is also low. When facing a small number of simple things, people will also estimate the time to be longer, which creates the illusion of “too grindy”.</p>
<p>Finally, “after finishing one wave, I have to wait for the next wave” implies that players may lack other interactive content during the waiting period, and are therefore more likely to focus on the waiting time.</p>
<p>(4) For the fourth and fifth feedbacks, although players also feedback grind, it is more of a grind that players actively choose, which does not necessarily represent negative feedback. For example, sandbox games and simulation management games are also often said to be “grindy” by players, but players often choose to grind with a certain purpose, which can be said to be concentrating on grinding; some outstanding games can also attract players to start a second playthrough, or fight the same boss hundreds or thousands of times. Therefore, even repetitive content can avoid the problem of “grind” if it can give players a slightly different experience each time or guide players to establish different goals at different stages.</p>

How to Alleviate Players’ Time Illusion</h2><h3 id="Some-psychological-inspirations"><a href="#Some-psychological-inspirations" class="headerlink" title="Some psychological inspirations"></a>Some psychological inspirations</h3><p>Regardless of the real grind caused by game design problems, how can we alleviate the grind caused by time illusion?</p>
<p>Players’ time perception is affected by both individual factors and environmental factors. Individual factors such as emotions and interests are not easy to control in actual development, and the specific situation varies, but in terms of environmental factors, we can still get some inspiration from psychology.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t let players wait foolishly. Appropriate distraction will be better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as waiting for someone is a torment, waiting for game loading is also a torment. Providing some engaging TV programs, newspapers and other content during the waiting process can distract people from the waiting time, thereby reducing their perceived waiting time. Similarly, filling the loading, matching and other waiting interfaces of the game with some interesting content can also achieve the same effect. It should be noted that studies have shown that different fillers have different effects on the perception of waiting time. If the filler cannot attract people, it will not only fail to reduce their perceived waiting time, but will also have the opposite effect.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Strengthen prompts and feedback on the status to reduce uncertainty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, it is to give clear feedback on all status information, including waiting time, so that players can clearly know what processes are still to come and the estimated time of each process. Life experience tells us that waiting before the agreed time will not make us emotionally volatile, but every minute of being late makes people irritable. Psychologists have proposed that people feel that the uncertain waiting time is longer than the definite waiting time. If they know nothing about the relevant information of the waiting time, they will perceive the time to be longer than the actual time, and vice versa.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Consider enriching the player’s psychological experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, within a certain period of time, the more and richer the number of things that happen, the more complex the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be shorter, which suggests that we need to provide players with more and richer game content. But it should be noted that these contents need to be able to enrich the player’s psychological experience rather than increase the player’s cognitive burden, that is to say, a complicated interface cannot achieve the same effect. Too much and complicated interface information may cause confusion to players, making them feel that it takes longer by reducing their sense of control; it may also directly trigger players’ negative emotions, thinking that the product looks very “grindy”.</p>
