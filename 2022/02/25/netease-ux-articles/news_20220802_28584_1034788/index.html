<p>Many fans of mystery games are fascinated by the worlds of deduction created by Japanese text-based mystery games. This article mainly introduces how Japanese text-based mystery games use the element of “closed circle” to create a satisfying world of deduction for players.</p>
<p>Japanese mystery adventure games are a game genre with regional cultural characteristics. Although relatively niche, they have many excellent works. From doujin circles to large game companies, from <em>Kamaitachi no Yoru</em> to <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> and <em>The House in Fata Morgana</em>, Japanese text-based mystery games attract players from all over the world with their unique charm. Emphasizing atmosphere creation, character development, and a compelling storyline are the essence of Japanese text-based mystery adventure games. The key to adventure games lies in player engagement and experience. Pure text games often lack interactive elements, making it difficult for players to immerse themselves in the game. In order to give players an immersive gaming experience, Japanese text-based mystery games pay more attention to atmosphere creation to enhance the player’s sense of immersion and involvement. Therefore, this article will summarize a common technique used in Japanese text-based mystery games to create atmosphere and analyze how this type of text game uses the “closed circle” element to enable players to participate in the plot and successfully empathize.</p>

Because the story of <em>And Then There Were None</em> takes place on an isolated island, the “Closed Circle” setting is also known as the “isolated island” setting. This setting was re-created and reached its peak in Japan. Nowadays, many Japanese indie AVG games reflect the setting of “Closed Circle”. A “Closed Circle” is an isolated predicament caused by natural or man-made factors, in which all the characters are gathered in a relatively closed environment and cannot temporarily contact the outside world. In an environment where everyone cannot leave, bizarre incidents of people being killed one after another occur, and the murderer is hidden among these people. In text-based mystery games, players often need to play the role of an investigator, searching for clues and making deductions while the number of survivors decreases.</p>

Practical Application</h2><h3 id="Japanese-Mystery-Games-Umineko-When-They-Cry-Return-to-Shironagasu-Island"><a href="#Japanese-Mystery-Games-Umineko-When-They-Cry-Return-to-Shironagasu-Island" class="headerlink" title="Japanese Mystery Games Umineko When They Cry &amp; Return to Shironagasu Island"></a>Japanese Mystery Games <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> &amp; <em>Return to Shironagasu Island</em></h3><p><em>Umineko When They Cry</em> is an indie text-based mystery game produced by the Japanese doujin circle 07th Expansion. The game has typical “Closed Circle” elements such as “an isolated island in a storm” and “a mansion”. (The following text is partly from the game’s website story introduction) The game story takes place on a small island called Rokkenjima. This is the location of the Ushiromiya family, a wealthy family. Every year on the first weekend of October, family members go to the island to attend a family meeting. On October 4, 1986, the family head Kinzo Ushiromiya was seriously ill, and the meeting was temporarily hosted by his eldest son Krauss. The other children were arguing over the division of the inheritance. Kinzo in the study completely disdained his vulture-like children and closed the door to concentrate on studying mysterious black magic. The grandchildren ignored the open and secret struggles between their parents and got along very harmoniously. There were also five servants in the house, three of whom were favored by the family head, and two of whom had met the family… Due to the typhoon, Rokkenjima became an isolated island cut off from the outside world. Two days later, when the typhoon subsided, the police boarded the island and saw only a horrific scene. Afterwards, someone found a letter hoping to solve the truth of the witch’s murder, making the incident a mystery that no one could solve for many years. What happened on the island during the two days when it was isolated from the world? Was it a witch’s murder or a human crime? As a suspenseful mystery work, <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> hopes that players will have fun in the process of reasoning. The player’s first goal is to solve the mystery of the “Closed Circle” murder on Rokkenjima and identify who the culprit is.</p>

The mansion “Ruisseau Sec” that the protagonist sneaks into to investigate is located on Shironagasu Island, where even the GPS positioning system fails. The game starts with a mysterious invitation to an unknown island, Shironagasu Island, in a wealthy man’s will. The protagonist of the game, Sen Ikeda, who owns a detective agency in New York, and a mysterious girl with supernatural powers, Neneko Izumozaki, board Shironagasu Island together. Many incredible things happened on Shironagasu Island, and the two also experienced multiple bizarre murders. What kind of mystery is hidden on the mysterious Shironagasu Island? The player-controlled protagonist needs to find various clues on the isolated island of Shironagasu, solve the puzzles, and then escape safely from this cursed island.</p>

In the “Closed Circle” setting, the characters in the closed space will be under the special pressure of “coexisting with unknown dangers” and “being isolated and helpless”. The trapped people in the game will start to panic, become anxious, distrust each other, and even gradually make various irrational behaviors. The protagonist controlled by the player will always be or temporarily be in a state of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Human survival instincts and fear of the unknown make players pay attention to the protagonist’s survival at all times - because they may encounter unknown dangers at any time. They don’t know what dangers lie ahead or what will happen next, and this coincides with the human psychology of innate fear of unknown things and survival instincts. In mystery games, players never know who the murderer is until the last moment. The setting of “the murderer is by my side in a closed space, but I can’t escape” can successfully awaken the player’s nervousness and fear, making the player feel as if they are experiencing it themselves, fearing the unknown.</p>
<p>Many “Closed Circle” games value the atmosphere of the entire game process more than the final ending of solving the case and finding out the true identity of the murderer. Usually, Japanese mystery games are set to have multiple endings, giving players more room for divergent thinking at the end. Many Japanese text-based mystery games also add innovative settings such as item discovery and use, countdowns, or reincarnation, parallel worlds, or superpowers to the Closed Circle setting, which makes closed-circle mystery-solving more interesting.</p>
<p>Because the “Closed Circle” setting has a good rendering effect on the game atmosphere, it has been increasingly used in domestic games of the same type in recent years. The Chinese indie game <em>Misty Summer</em> also uses the same technique, setting the murder in a mountaintop villa. The protagonist needs to spend 7 days in a mountaintop villa isolated from the outside world and find the truth of the story. Standing on the same starting line as the characters in the story, solving puzzles in a closed environment, and interacting while reading, “Closed Circle” games are often accompanied by cleverly designed “logic” and touching “plot”. Therefore, this type of game has become a paradise for reasoning enthusiasts.</p>

Taking <em>Return to Shironagasu Island</em> as an example, there are a total of 1660 reviews on the Steam page, of which 1615 are positive, with a positive rate of up to 97.2%. Most players praised the “Closed Circle” setting, the interlocking plot, and the immersive experience in the game.</p>

From the beginning, development, climax, and end of the story, each part is naturally integrated and connected, with rich and appropriate character performances. No part is too thin, and no segment is too long. For text adventure mystery games, the requirements for operation are almost zero. On the basis of abandoning the original operational gameplay of the game, text adventure mystery games pay more attention to psychological interactive gameplay. Players become the protagonists of the novel, immersed in the complete game atmosphere, shedding tears for the death of friends in the game, and trembling with excitement for their avatar, the “protagonist”, finally escaping from the isolated island, as if they had experienced all this in reality. These feedbacks are a true reflection of the player’s emotional involvement. Many players will play through a good game multiple times, and each time they will have a different emotional experience. There is a saying circulating in this circle: “First playthrough, initial contact; second playthrough, watch the plot; third playthrough, dig into the details; fourth playthrough, all achievements; fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth playthroughs, specifically for nostalgia.” This is the unique charm of text adventure mystery games that attracts players.</p>
