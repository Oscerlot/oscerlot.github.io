<h2 id="1-About-Fitness-Games"><a href="#1-About-Fitness-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. About Fitness Games"></a>1. About Fitness Games</h2><p>Fitness games usually refer to a type of game and exercise method that combines exercise and gaming. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1980s, when gaming giant Atari was studying how to help players exercise through games. Their solution was to combine Atari’s home console with an exercise bike, but unfortunately this product ultimately failed. In the following decades, many companies tried to launch devices that combined exercise with entertainment. In 2006, Nintendo’s Wii console began to popularize the concept of “fitness games”, and this type of game became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is one of the most successful examples.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-Content-Attracts-Players-in-the-Early-Stage"><a href="#2-What-Content-Attracts-Players-in-the-Early-Stage" class="headerlink" title="2. What Content Attracts Players in the Early Stage?"></a>2. What Content Attracts Players in the Early Stage?</h2><h3 id="Changes-in-Visual-Representation"><a href="#Changes-in-Visual-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Changes in Visual Representation"></a>Changes in Visual Representation</h3><p>Traditional fitness is boring and monotonous. Most ordinary people often give up halfway due to lack of self-discipline during the fitness process, and it is difficult to achieve the purpose of fitness. The emergence of fitness games is to solve the problem of fitness being boring. However, most fitness games do not integrate exercise and gaming well. For example, in <em>Fitness Boxing</em>, players need to complete corresponding boxing actions according to the instructions of the coach in the game, and the system will judge according to the accuracy of the actions. In the game, the visual representation of each fitness action is still the action itself, which is still presented in the form of a result. <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is more like a software that uses motion sensing to assist fitness. It does not fundamentally improve the player’s boring experience in the fitness process.</p>
<p>But in <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, the visual representation of fitness actions in real life has been changed in the game. Fitness actions are no longer the result, but a means. Players need to perform different fitness actions to achieve different presentation effects. For example, in Adventure mode, the fitness action of abdominal pressing is sometimes visually presented as flying; in Casual mode, the squatting action is visually presented as pottery. The change in visual representation makes the fitness process itself interesting, and the diverse forms of representation in the game further stimulate players to experience other game (fitness) content.</p>

<h2 id="3-Why-Can-Players-Persist-in-Playing"><a href="#3-Why-Can-Players-Persist-in-Playing" class="headerlink" title="3. Why Can Players Persist in Playing?"></a>3. Why Can Players Persist in Playing?</h2><h3 id="RPG-Game-Framework"><a href="#RPG-Game-Framework" class="headerlink" title="RPG Game Framework"></a>RPG Game Framework</h3><p>In addition to the changes in visual effects, the more important innovation of <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> lies in the change of its game form. The Adventure mode, which is the core of the <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> game, builds a framework for an RPG game. It integrates exercise into the game, achieving a balance between fitness and gameplay. The game follows the consistent monster-fighting and leveling-up mode of RPGs. The protagonist needs to embark on an adventure with his Ring-Con, defeat all the enemies encountered along the way, and defeat the final BOSS. The game incorporates common RPG game elements such as gold collection, monster fighting and leveling up, skill talents, equipment and armor, side quests, and so on. Thus, fitness is no longer the player’s only motivation, and the continuous growth of the game character also drives players to continue to experience the game. The two motivations complement each other, which allows players to achieve the purpose of fitness while enjoying the fun of the game. On the other hand, part of the player’s attention will be diverted from the fitness itself to the process of fighting monsters and leveling up, which to a certain extent helps players ignore the fatigue and boredom of fitness, and ultimately translates into longer fitness time and better exercise results.</p>

<h3 id="Concrete-Instant-Feedback"><a href="#Concrete-Instant-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Concrete Instant Feedback"></a>Concrete Instant Feedback</h3><p>During the fitness process, two parts of the character played by the player will show a “burning” special effect. The first part is the hair. The size of the burning flame of the hair corresponds to the accuracy of the player’s fitness movements; the second burning part is the body part that is actually used for each fitness movement, and the name of the corresponding body part will also be marked on the screen. First of all, when players do local fitness exercises, the burning special effects will give players the illusion that a certain body part is burning fat. When players form a psychological hint of burning fat, players will subconsciously correct and improve their movements in order to maximize the fat burning effect (the degree of hair burning). Similar psychological cues include the animation of abdominal strength. When the player is charging up, the beer belly will gradually transform into eight-pack abs. At the same time, when the player is defending against the boss’s attack, the abdominal muscle shield will also change with the size of the player’s strength. When players subconsciously regard their abdomen as the huge abdominal muscle shield in front of them, players will be motivated by this to continue to squeeze their abdomen involuntarily. The purpose of the above two designs is actually to present the “invisible” instant benefits of fitness in reality to the player in the most intuitive way, so as to maximize the player’s motivation in the fitness process.</p>

Why Don’t Players Get Tired of Playing?</h2><h3 id="Evolution-of-the-Same-Action-Gameplay"><a href="#Evolution-of-the-Same-Action-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="Evolution of the Same Action Gameplay"></a>Evolution of the Same Action Gameplay</h3><p>In the actual fitness scene, people generally achieve the purpose of exercising a certain part by repeatedly completing a set of actions. However, <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, through continuous innovation in gameplay, makes the same actions no longer repetitive and monotonous, which minimizes the boring experience that players need to endure when repeating a single fitness action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F350ae499-216d-4dc6-ae09-11c4a659420f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;350ae499-216d-4dc6-ae09-11c4a659420f.png"></p>
<p>Take the squat as an example. At the beginning of the game, squats are used to trigger the ejection switch, and players only need to complete the simplest squat action. Later, the game introduced a switch that needs to be continuously squatted to trigger, which has additional requirements on the basic squat action. Then, the game added a spring mechanism, the effect of which is to bounce higher and higher, which requires players to perform multiple squats. Subsequently, squats evolved from springs to swings. Swings are in groups of six squats, and the rhythm is emphasized during the process, requiring players to complete them continuously. In addition, squats have also evolved into a rail car gameplay, where players need to control the rail car through squats, moving forward a little with each squat. If they encounter an uphill, players need to squat quickly and continuously, which also exercises the player’s endurance and explosive power. A simple squat mechanism has evolved all the way in terms of gameplay. In terms of fitness experience, it not only meets the players’ fitness needs for repeated exercise of the squat action, but also the gradually increasing difficulty of the gameplay enables players to master the skills and essentials of squatting. In terms of gaming experience, the form of presentation and gameplay of squats in the game are constantly changing; even if players are doing repetitive fitness movements, they can still feel a sense of freshness.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Fitness itself is a time-consuming, weak-feedback, monotonous and painful exercise. Not only do you have to endure the boring process, but also the torment of fatigue. It takes a long time for people to see results. In contrast, the game itself is a culture based on entertainment, and one of the biggest features is strong feedback. <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is trying to amplify these two parts. In the early stage, players will be mainly attracted by the novel visual representation. The fitness actions in reality are presented in a gamified way, so that players can perceive the fun in the fitness process. At the same time, the “invisible” instant benefits of fitness in reality are presented to the player in the most intuitive way, maximizing the player’s motivation in the fitness process. When players experience for a period of time and perceive the core fun of RPG games, fitness itself is no longer the only motivation for players to continue to experience. Finally, the continuous evolution of the same fitness action gameplay not only meets the basic needs of players for increasing fitness difficulty, but also minimizes the boring experience that players need to endure when repeating a single action. The continuous provision of freshness and fun in terms of gameplay content ultimately drives players to continue to experience the game (fitness).</p>
