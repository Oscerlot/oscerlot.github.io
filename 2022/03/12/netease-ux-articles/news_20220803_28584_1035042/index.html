<p>“Elden Ring”, developed by FromSoftware, caused a craze at the beginning of this year. The influx of a large number of out-of-circle players has made the game’s player base complex and ambiguous. Can these players, who are not the target audience of “Elden Ring”, really stay in the game after experiencing it? If so, how did they stay? Out of the professional habit of a user researcher, the author has come into deep contact with players to get a glimpse of the survival status of this group of out-of-circle players.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Out-of-Circle-“Elden-Ring”"><a href="#1-The-Out-of-Circle-“Elden-Ring”" class="headerlink" title="1. The Out-of-Circle “Elden Ring”"></a>1. The Out-of-Circle “Elden Ring”</h2><p>On February 25, 2022, the gaming community experienced a carnival. The name of this carnival was “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>Winning the TGA’s Most Anticipated Game award for two consecutive years, the player test version before the official release, and the high media score of 97 all made this game the “white moonlight” in the hearts of many game players. The game’s performance after its launch also lived up to expectations. Despite encountering optimization problems, just a few days after its launch, the peak number of online players on Steam reached nearly 900,000, reaching the seventh highest peak in the history of Steam online player count, far exceeding its predecessors “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” and “Dark Souls 3”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2F1a99bd9b-7031-471c-950b-db84df9dc38b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;1a99bd9b-7031-471c-950b-db84df9dc38b.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>As of 2022.3.7, comparison of the peak number of players in the Soul series games, data source: SteamDB</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The extent to which “Elden Ring” has gone out of the circle is even greater than that of “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” last time.</p>
<p>The term “out-of-circle” was originally used mostly in the entertainment industry, generally referring to a person or work breaking through its original small circle and being accepted and recognized by more people. Now, the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring” means the same thing - the original Soul series players often stayed within their own community, especially in the early years of “Demon’s Souls”, “Dark Souls 1”, and “Dark Souls 2”, where there were very few players. Even for the later best-selling “Dark Souls 3”, due to the ban on domestic live broadcast platforms, it was only a niche masterpiece in the eyes of passers-by. Against this background, Soul series players formed their own unique small circle and circle culture. However, this small circle has been gradually broken by live broadcasts and short videos in recent years. A large number of cloud players and new players converted from cloud players have poured in, making Soul series games gradually move to a larger stage. And “Elden Ring” is undoubtedly the center of attention.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring”, including the game’s own design, long-term publicity and build-up, and the differentiation provided due to game homogeneity in the industry. We can also pay attention to the long-term, short-term, beneficial, and unfavorable impacts that this “out-of-circle” has brought to Elden Ring. However, out of the professional habit of user research, I am more curious about the new players brought about by the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring”. They have never been exposed to or at least have never played Soul series games themselves before, and their understanding of this type of game is largely limited to impressions such as “difficult”, “dark”, and “suffering”. Their reasons for buying the game may be to follow the trend, to try something new, or to be very confident in their own operational skills and want to challenge this so-called game that makes clumsy players quit.</p>
<p>In the following text, we may as well call these players “out-of-circle players” - although they are essentially new players, this time the new players have exceeded the normal player turnover rhythm of the game. A large number of casual players, MMO players, MOBA players and other types of players, and even players who may have never played games before, have poured into this party, making the entire game player group a mixed bag. It is difficult for us to truly understand what these players are like. Everyone’s reasons for joining the party are different, and players’ preferences often vary from person to person. However, we can always see some commonalities of these players from some cases. Coincidentally, I have several such out-of-circle players around me. From them, we may be able to see the current survival status of out-of-circle players in “Elden Ring”, making the fog surrounding the out-of-circle players a little clearer.</p>
<h2 id="2-Case-1-The-Clumsy-“Spiderman”-Ring"><a href="#2-Case-1-The-Clumsy-“Spiderman”-Ring" class="headerlink" title="2. Case 1: The Clumsy “Spiderman” Ring"></a>2. Case 1: The Clumsy “Spiderman” Ring</h2><p>“Spiderman” (pseudonym) is my best friend.</p>
<p>The year before last, when I was fighting fiercely with Isshin Ashina in “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, “Spiderman” let me experience what it’s like to be a live streamer for the first time. He watched me almost all the way through “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, and I didn’t hesitate to share my real-time tactics and understanding of the game during the game - although these didn’t seem to have much effect. My experience sharing didn’t help him get started better. He was still flustered when facing the first BOSS. After being defeated by the BOSS several times without taking damage, he put down the controller helplessly and chose to complete the game via watching others play.</p>
<p>But in fact, I can totally understand “Spiderman”. As a 9-to-6 office worker in the online education industry, he has to prepare lesson plans and teaching plans when he goes to work, and after work and on weekends, he has to turn on the camera and diligently irrigate the flowers of the motherland. His free time is scarce and fragmented. He was even preparing lesson plans on New Year’s Eve: when we were joking in a WeChat video call, he was wearing pajamas, with messy hair like a bird’s nest, writing hard on the computer, as if he had just woken up. If it weren’t for Jia Ling’s voice on TV being too recognizable, I would have even thought it was still early morning.</p>
<p>Games are not a necessity for “Spiderman”, nor are they his only entertainment activity. They are more like a theme or direction for him to seek entertainment - he doesn’t necessarily have to play them himself. The gossip and memes of the professional player circle, the live broadcasts of major games, and the wonderful game clips on Douyin (TikTok) are what really attract him. He hasn’t played many games of LOL, but he can accurately name the skills and ultimate moves of each hero in each LPL game; he hasn’t played “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” much, but he knows the skills of the BOSSes in “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” like the back of his hand; he has fewer than 30 games in his own Steam library, and the total game time is less than 100 hours, but he seems to be a seasoned game master.</p>
<p>“Spiderman” is very clear about the reason why he can’t play games: “Poor reaction, can’t judge the moves. I can only run around, and the attack is inefficient, which is very frustrating.” He also tried to look at guides, but “it’s useless, there’s no way to cheese it.” But knowing is one thing, and he still enjoys buying some games that he can’t beat, such as “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, “Monster Hunter”, and this time’s “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>He seems to be confident in his gaming skills, as if he has forgotten his painful experience in Sekiro: “It’s an open world, you can leave the BOSS alone for now, and then go back to fight it after leveling up.”</p>
<p>“And if you can’t beat it, you can just refund it.”</p>
<p>Then, his words came true. From launch to refund, “Spiderman” spent a total of 0.8 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2Fc1fa26cf-173a-40de-a60c-ed6b50658191.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;c1fa26cf-173a-40de-a60c-ed6b50658191.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>“Spiderman”‘s recent play history, “Elden Ring” is forever stuck at 0.8 hours</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When I asked “Spiderman” about the reason for pre-ordering “Elden Ring”, he replied to me in 0.1 seconds on WeChat:</p>
<p>“Following the trend.” Then he spent another 30 seconds giving the second reason: “The media reviews are very high.”</p>
<p>According to him, many of his colleagues and classmates around him have bought “Elden Ring”, but few of them have stayed. The difficulty of the game not only discouraged him, but also discouraged a large circle of friends around him.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that even though he has been discouraged time and time again, “Spiderman” has not shown a strong aversion to Soulslike games. He has always had a considerable degree of goodwill towards the game, which comes from the game’s fragmented narrative, riddle-like plot, and bizarre worldview.</p>
<p>He bluntly stated that when the next Soulslike game comes out, he will still consider pre-ordering it–</p>
<p>“I always feel like I can do it. I bought ‘Sekiro’. I’m a collector, I don’t have to play it, but I have to have it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it would be better if there was dynamic difficulty.”</p>
<p>I seemed to see the pure and simple smile of this northern man through the phone screen.</p>
<p>h2&gt;3. Case 2: The Amazing “Captain Marvel”</p>
<p>Through “Spiderman”, I felt that I had figured out the survival status of this group of out-of-circle players, but the case from “Captain Marvel” (pseudonym) gave me some new insights into this group of players.</p>
<p>The “out-of-circle” effect of “Elden Ring” on “Captain Marvel” actually came from some very accidental factors. According to her, it mainly came from three aspects. The first is the overwhelming sharing of “Elden Ring” seen in her Moments, the second is the public opinion bombardment of high-scoring media (“I feel like I’m missing out if I don’t play it”), and the third is the game promotion pictures that she accidentally saw, which looked sunny, with beautiful scenery, and seemed like a paradise. If the first point represents following the trend and professional instinct (like me, “Captain Marvel” also belongs to the user experience department), the second point represents game quality and public opinion publicity, and the third point is a real personal preference - “I don’t really like the dark style of Dark Souls. This time, the promotional pictures of ‘Elden Ring’ are not so dark. The overworld looks quite ‘sunny’.”</p>
<p>But “luring them in” is one thing, whether they can play it or not is another. After all, in my impression, “Captain Marvel” is not a fan of Soulslike games. The game she played the most before was actually an MMO game. According to my observations, I can reasonably believe that the label “action game klutz” is very suitable for her.</p>
<p>And her real gaming experience did prove this.</p>
<p>“After being abused in ‘Elden Ring’ for a day, I quit the game and realized how beautiful the world is.” This was her first-day evaluation of “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>During the first day, she didn’t dare to fight the BOSS at all, just ran around to open up the map. After opening 8 maps, she was still carrying the novice’s broken shield and broken sword. Finally, she looked at related videos and guides online and decided to give up her current class and choose the more powerful and easy-to-use mage class. These series of operations, which are incomprehensible to veteran Soulslike players, very realistically reflect the game path of out-of-circle players represented by her in the game.</p>
<p>Just when I thought this was another sad story of discouragement, the situation seemed to be a little different.</p>
<p>After restarting the game as a mage, her game path became smooth again. With the help of guides, she not only successfully walked out of the novice dungeon, but also defeated one or two small BOSSes, and temporarily survived safely in this game.</p>
<p>“Captain Marvel”‘s “retention” in “Elden Ring” is largely due to her own “alternative” pursuits and playstyles in the game. When she played “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” before, she was obsessed with opening up the map everywhere, unlocking shrines one by one according to the guides (but not completing the shrines), and then heading to the next shrine. In “Naraka: Bladepoint”, she rarely plays ranked matches. She has no interest in practicing her skills, but she is very fond of costumes and character customization. This “alternative” is reflected in “Elden Ring” as: she doesn’t like to challenge difficult BOSSes like ordinary players, but prefers to collect strange equipment, weapons and spells. “Elden Bling”, indeed.</p>
<p>With the expectation of these contents, “Captain Marvel” has, to a certain extent, overcome those uncomfortable experiences (the gloomy dungeons, the instant-killing small monsters), and has become a retained player of “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>h2&gt;4. Some Thoughts on Out-of-Circle and Out-of-Circle Players</p>
<p>“Seeing a falling leaf, one knows autumn is coming; seeing a leopard’s spot, one can see the whole leopard.”</p>
<p>There are actually many cases like “Spiderman” and “Captain Marvel”, but most of them are not around me, so I can only get a glimpse of the survival status of these players from the bits and pieces on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Following the trend” is often the main reason why these players choose to try the game. It’s just that the specific forms may be different for different players. “Spiderman” comes from daily communication with classmates and colleagues, while “Captain Marvel” comes from the “unpaid promotion” of social platforms. We can also imagine that some players come from QQ groups or WeChat groups of other games. For example, a certain “Naraka: Bladepoint” player suddenly pops up in his small group: I’m stuck on a BOSS, is there any other Elden Ring player who can help me?</p>
<p>The “out-of-circle” of Elden Ring is also due to the game’s good publicity and promotion on another level. Some of these promotions are deliberately done by the publisher or developer, such as the game’s early trials, cooperation with the famous fantasy writer George R.R. Martin, epic promotional CGs, etc., while others come from the praise of the media and players, which is a chain reaction brought about by the quality of the game. The high score of 97 is rare in recent years, and there is a feeling of “you’ll miss out if you don’t play it, you have to try it even if you just want to taste it”. Finally, the viral spread of live broadcasts and short videos has also well reached these non-game players who may not usually pay attention to game information. Some obvious evidence is that some of my friends who never play games and only watch Douyin (TikTok) occasionally ask me what kind of game this is.</p>
<p>From the cases of “Spiderman” and “Captain Marvel”, we can actually see another clue that made them “out-of-circle”, that is, the game itself is releasing some signals to welcome new players. Concerns about difficulty are dispelled by the setting of leveling up, the brighter and more open overworld provides a buffer for some “claustrophobic” players, the open world design also attracts more players who like to explore, and the cooperation with George R.R. Martin has also attracted a group of fans of Western fantasy plots to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Behind Elden Ring’s strong fan-drawing speed, we also have to admit that a large part of out-of-circle players are like my “Spiderman” friend, who found a game that is not suitable for them in the blind trend. Judging from the completion rate of Steam achievements, most players haven’t even met the novice BOSS in the game before choosing to end it hastily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2Febb18c90-3172-4779-8ff9-52fd9bb1a411.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;ebb18c90-3172-4779-8ff9-52fd9bb1a411.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Steam “Elden Ring” global achievement completion rate, one-third of players did not pass the first BOSS</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The retention of out-of-circle players is always an epic problem facing out-of-circle games. Because it involves two issues at the same time, one is the question of “whether there is”, and the other is the question of “whether it is enough”.</p>
<p>We cannot expect all players to be the target audience of the game, and after trying the game, they will be pleasantly surprised to find that this game is exactly what they want, and become addicted to it. Those out-of-circle players who have successfully stayed are more like “Captain Marvel”, who have found their own unique preferences and goals in the game, regardless of whether these goals are the core highlights of the game. The existence of these goals and preferences allows them to accept to a certain extent, or actively seek some ways to overcome the negative experiences brought about by the game. The existence or absence of a goal is the question of “whether there is”.</p>
<p>Player retention is often a process of game between the game’s attraction points and pain points for them. Whether the attraction point is strong enough is the question of “whether it is enough”. “Spiderman”‘s departure was because he couldn’t solve the problem of being clumsy, and the attraction of the worldview and plot to him was diluted by short videos and live broadcasts; “Captain Marvel” chose to stay because her goals in the game were strong enough (“Elden Bling”), and she also found a good way to solve the difficulty problem (looking at guides). The departure and stay of every player are all like this.</p>
<p>From this point of view, if you want to keep my “Spiderman” friend, you may really need to wait until the day when the game has dynamic difficulty, or the short video platform disappears overnight. It’s just that I don’t think this day will ever come.</p>
