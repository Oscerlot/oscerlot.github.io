<h2 id="1-Overview-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#1-Overview-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of Game Localization"></a>1. Overview of Game Localization</h2><p>With the continuous development of technology, the ways people choose to spend their leisure time have also greatly increased. Today, digital games (i.e., various games designed and developed using digital technology and implemented on digital devices) have many followers almost all over the world, and they no longer belong only to the language and culture in which they are released. Thanks to game localization, many games have been translated into other languages to reach more players.</p>
<p>Through game localization translation, the game is fully adapted to the culture of the target language and is driven by the history and stories of that culture. Game translation is constantly evolving in this field and has become more important with the increase of e-sports enthusiasts, but it can only achieve its main purpose when it is carried out by qualified and experienced translators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2Fcd18bae6-6476-4998-b2da-91882e226806.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;cd18bae6-6476-4998-b2da-91882e226806.png"></p>
<h2 id="2-General-Characteristics-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#2-General-Characteristics-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="2. General Characteristics of Game Localization"></a>2. General Characteristics of Game Localization</h2><p>After games entered our lives with the production of computers and mobile phones, they also created a huge global market. Especially in terms of text translation, professional language talents are needed, so the concept of game localization has emerged. An important reason why professional language talents are needed is that each game has a unique structure, special terminology, and scenarios.  Localization can transform special terms and “introduced” things to match the local cultural background, eliminate cultural barriers brought by “introduced” products, and ultimately meet the needs of local customers and realize the market value of products.</p>
<p>Localization mainly includes two basic aspects, one is text translation, and the other is cultural exchange beyond text translation. Cultural exchange includes language, culture, customs, and habits. Localization is equal to text translation plus cultural adaptation. Localization has a certain degree of adaptation and redesign space for the translated text. While making the translation close to the original text, it can also reflect the distinctive cultural characteristics of the region.</p>
<p>In the game <em>League of Legends</em>, the English names of Rakan and Xayah are “The Charmer” and “The Rebel”, respectively. In the Chinese server, “The Charmer” is translated as “幻翎” (Huàn Líng).  “幻” (Huàn) corresponds to the literal translation of the English title, and “翎” (Líng) refers to a type of feather, which matches the appearance characteristics of the hero. “The Rebel” is translated as “逆羽” (Nì Yǔ). “逆” (Nì) reflects the hero’s rebelliousness, and “羽” (Yǔ) means “feather”, the weapon used by the hero. “翎” (Líng) and “羽” (Yǔ) correspond to each other, and “洛” (Luò) and “霞” (Xiá) are taken from Wang Bo’s “Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng” - “落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色” (Falling rosy clouds fly together with a lone wild duck, and the autumn water shares the same color with the vast sky). Through flexible translation, the communicative purpose is achieved without affecting the player’s gaming experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Skills-to-Master-for-Game-Localization"><a href="#3-Skills-to-Master-for-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3. Skills to Master for Game Localization"></a>3. Skills to Master for Game Localization</h2><p>Every game contains a variety of dialogues, songs, literary texts, word games, and references to the source culture. When all these elements cannot be fully translated into the target language, the gaming experience is negatively affected. To avoid this negative situation, you should first be familiar with different types of text when localizing games. At the same time, it is extremely important to keep up with the constantly changing game terminology. It is equally important that the localization team understands the trends that are rapidly spreading among players and the ever-changing and evolving technology. Especially in online games involving many players, the player community creates their own jargon, an online language.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, developed by NetEase’s 24 Entertainment and supported by Leihuo UX, the game takes place on an island called “Morus Isle” (聚窟洲 - Jù Kū Zhōu), which has complex terrain, cliffs, and ravines, with bamboo forests, ancient cities, shipwrecks, and ancient temples. When localizing the game, the first thing to do is to understand and master the knowledge related to “Wuxia” (武侠) and “Wuxia games”. Secondly, it is necessary to consider how to translate terms such as “Parry” (振刀 - Zhèn Dāo), “Special Souljade” (特殊魂玉 - Tè Shū Hún Yù), “Attribute Souljade” (属性魂玉 - Shǔ Xìng Hún Yù), and “Worship” (祭拜 - Jì Bài) in a way that conforms to the local customs of the players, using some easy-to-understand words to help players better understand the game.</p>
<p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has been localized into 14 languages worldwide. In addition to the popular markets such as Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, the Turkish market is also a new attempt. In the process of game localization in the Middle East market, more consideration should be given to the local customs and religious background. In the game, players have a task that needs to be completed through worship. However, most countries in the Middle East believe in Islam, so it is necessary to use words like worship more cautiously. Instead, the content of worship in the game is changed to “prayer” (祷告 - Dǎo Gào), which is more in line with the local cultural and religious background.</p>

<h2 id="4-Game-Localization-in-the-Turkish-Market"><a href="#4-Game-Localization-in-the-Turkish-Market" class="headerlink" title="4. Game Localization in the Turkish Market"></a>4. Game Localization in the Turkish Market</h2><p>As a place where Eastern and Western cultures meet, Turkey has a relatively high acceptance of mainstream games currently on the market. The mobile Internet has developed rapidly in the Middle East in recent years, especially Turkey, which is the largest mobile game market in the Middle East, accounting for nearly 40% of the market size of the entire Middle East. At the same time, Turkey is also the game market with the most demographic dividend in the Middle East. Its total population exceeds the total number of all individual European countries, and more than one-third of the population are gamers. According to statistics, Turkey’s gaming industry is moving towards an average annual revenue of $1 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2F48c39794-4d26-4163-b11a-6391d61f5998.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;48c39794-4d26-4163-b11a-6391d61f5998.png"></p>
<p>Currently, the revenue of the Turkish mobile game market is showing a continuous upward trend. Take November 2021 as an example. The total revenue of mobile games on both Google Play and App Store in Turkey was 2.5 times that of the same period in 2020, which is equivalent to the total revenue of Brazil and Chile. However, the revenue of Southeast Asia and Latin America, which are popular in the traditional mobile game market, is not as good as that of Turkey. The revenue growth in the past two years was only 50.5% and 27.6%, respectively, which is enough to show Turkey’s potential as an opportunity market.</p>
<p>However, a major difficulty in publishing games in Turkey is localization. The vast majority of Turkish players speak Turkish. However, Turkish is not as widely spoken as English. Currently, there are very few schools in China that offer Turkish language courses. Therefore, once you choose to enter the Turkish market, a major problem is a large and heavy localization problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2Fbc590ddc-b06f-47b8-8e54-8129a7b9a41b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;bc590ddc-b06f-47b8-8e54-8129a7b9a41b.png"></p>
<p>Speaking of the localization of Turkish games, the first thing to understand is the preferences of Turkish players and the historical background of Turkey. In terms of best-selling, FPS&#x2F;TPS and SLG are the main types of games that Turkish players pay for. At the same time, SLG is also the main source of payment in the entire Middle East market. Among the games that have gone overseas to Turkey, products from domestic manufacturers such as <em>PUBG MOBILE</em>, <em>Pasha Fencer</em>, <em>Game of Sultans</em>, <em>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</em>, and <em>Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade</em> account for 30%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2F33f0358b-44ce-4fc6-9b1a-8cfdbfc935e4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;33f0358b-44ce-4fc6-9b1a-8cfdbfc935e4.png"></p>
<p>For the localization of the Turkish market, language is only the first step. In addition to text, what games need more is to break down cultural, religious, and humanistic barriers. For example, <em>Game of Sultans</em> and <em>The Great Ottoman</em>, although these two games are not mainstream in terms of themes, they are indeed refined products that deeply cultivate the Turkish market. The games’ restoration of the historical background and cultural details of the Ottoman Empire in Turkey has made them widely popular in the Turkish market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the premise of localization is not only basic language, but more importantly, to find the cultural “base”. In addition to pan-culture, for historical themes such as the Ottoman Empire, after receiving good feedback in Turkey, it can also be extended to surrounding areas with similar cultural groups, such as the Middle East. However, it should be noted that religious elements should still be considered when localizing Turkish products. The mainstream religion in Turkey is Islam. Although most Turks belong to the more moderate Sunni sect, it is still necessary to be more cautious about some taboos of Muslims, and avoid the appearance of pigs and other religious elements.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>It is impossible to localize a multilingual game without a localization team that has fully mastered it. It is very important to translate the expressions in localized games into the target language with the same enthusiasm and sincerity. Therefore, translating games requires constantly summarizing game terminology and learning new terminology knowledge, rather than relying solely on a comprehensive dictionary.</p>
