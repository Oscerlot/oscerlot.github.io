<h2 id="1-Conceptual-Elaboration"><a href="#1-Conceptual-Elaboration" class="headerlink" title="1. Conceptual Elaboration"></a>1. Conceptual Elaboration</h2><h3 id="Gamification-Definition"><a href="#Gamification-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Definition"></a>Gamification Definition</h3><p>The common definition of gamification is the application of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts to change people’s inherent behavior patterns. The most popular gamification in China, for example, simply copies the game’s system, regardless of whether it is suitable for the current theme or whether it is fun. Simply adding points, badges&#x2F;achievement systems, and leaderboards (i.e., the PBL system) applies the shell of the game to the themed activity. But this can only be called a game-like product that utilizes the external presentation of the game, falling into the narrow cognitive misunderstanding of gamification. In essence, gamification should not be just a simple application of the game framework to various scenarios. Gamification design should be a way of thinking, empowering non-gamified scenarios or industries through the core driving force of the game, allowing users to gain more fun and create greater value in the process of experience.</p>
<h3 id="Gamification-Elements"><a href="#Gamification-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Elements"></a>Gamification Elements</h3><p>The elements that make up gamification are diverse. From the perspective of their role in the gamification system, they can be divided into three categories: dynamics, mechanics, and components. They are arranged according to the degree of abstraction to form the DMC pyramid. At the bottom of the DMC pyramid of gamification elements are basic components, such as achievements, badges, and other elements, which are the specific manifestations of dynamics and mechanics. Above the components, mechanics, including chance, competition, and cooperation, are the basic processes that drive game progress and user participation. The top layer is dynamics, which is the driving force for users to use gamified products.</p>
<p>Various components form complex rules under the guidance of mechanics, and a complete gamification system is formed due to the drive of dynamic elements.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1: DMC Pyramid of Gamification Elements</em></p>

<p>Starting from the DMC pyramid for gamification design can provide some guidance, but it is easy to fall into the design misunderstanding of completing gamification only through components such as achievement leaderboards and coins.</p>
<h2 id="2-Gamification-Design"><a href="#2-Gamification-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Gamification Design"></a>2. Gamification Design</h2><p>How to break the simple game shell and empower gamification design? The Octalysis framework provides a core guiding framework.</p>
<p>Octalysis is a framework in gamification design. The core tenet is the “human-centered” design concept, not function-centered. It is composed of eight core drives. According to the different characteristics of the drives, they can be divided into: left-brain drives and right-brain drives, white hat gamification and black hat gamification. Left and right brain drives can be understood as extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Left-brain core drives often rely on extrinsic motivation, while right-brain core drives are mostly intrinsic motivation.</p>

<h3 id="Gamification-in-Service-Design"><a href="#Gamification-in-Service-Design" class="headerlink" title="Gamification in Service Design"></a>Gamification in Service Design</h3><p>The radiotherapy ward of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing University is a place that provides tumor treatment for adults and children in Southwest China. The hospital originally used standardized decoration, with pale wards, cold instruments, and the symptoms of adults’ illnesses, all bringing unknown fear to the children. After understanding the situation of the entire ward and the children’s treatment process, the designer transformed it into a “healing planet” for children.</p>
<p>The orange and warm white tones make the ordinary wards no longer cold, and elements of the IP world are also added to the medical area, running through the entire space. For example, after opening the glass door with 28 totems printed on it with a special bracelet, you can see the “little monsters” hidden in the plants at the entrance to greet the children.</p>

<p>The designer also added push-rod interactive devices and game areas to the renovation, relying on this approach to build a bridge for communication between parents and children, playing a role in mutual comfort.</p>

<p><em>Figure 5: Transformed Ward of Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing University - 3</em></p>

<p>From the perspective of the Octalysis framework, the transformation adds two drives, “social influence &amp; relatedness” and “unpredictability &amp; curiosity”, to the medical service. Under the premise of fully considering the needs of patients and their families, through the design of spatial flow, hardware and soft decoration design, and interactive device design, the fun of the medical process is increased, the curiosity of children is stimulated, and the social connection between patients and their families is strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="NetEase-Cloud-Music-Gamified-Marketing"><a href="#NetEase-Cloud-Music-Gamified-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="NetEase Cloud Music Gamified Marketing"></a>NetEase Cloud Music Gamified Marketing</h3><p>On May 26, 2021, NetEase Cloud Music and its partners launched a test. Users can test their personality color by listening to music and making choices, and can also share the test link to Moments, WeChat friends, social media, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F20b5dc34-f3aa-4b3e-a6a6-a03afa9ac030.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;20b5dc34-f3aa-4b3e-a6a6-a03afa9ac030.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Figure 6: NetEase Cloud Personality Main Color Test Poster</em></p>

<p>NetEase Cloud Music’s gamified marketing utilizes multiple drives to attract users, with “scarcity &amp; impatience” as the core and “social influence &amp; relatedness” as the boost, achieving a surge in public opinion. In the shared pictures and texts, you can see descriptions such as “In China, one out of every xx people will like you” and “Your characteristics”. The copywriting satisfies users’ desire for the uniqueness of their personal personality color, expresses recognition and affirmation of users’ own existence, and at the same time, according to the test results, it can be used to find people who match their own color and promote social relationships.</p>
<h3 id="Digital-Therapeutics-Prescription-Drug"><a href="#Digital-Therapeutics-Prescription-Drug" class="headerlink" title="Digital Therapeutics Prescription Drug"></a>Digital Therapeutics Prescription Drug</h3><p>EndeavorRx (AKL-T01) is a video game designed to improve attention and is the first digital therapeutic device designed to improve symptoms associated with ADHD (Attention Deficit&#x2F;Hyperactivity Disorder) that has received FDA (Food and Drug Administration) prescription drug approval certification. Unlike other video games played by children, the therapeutic procedures in the game are scientifically designed to challenge children’s brains during the treatment process while requiring children’s attention to be focused on multiple tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F05c7557b-0eac-41da-83a6-a4c130be798f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;05c7557b-0eac-41da-83a6-a4c130be798f.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 7: EndeavorRx Promotional Poster</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This game is mainly suitable for children aged 8-12 years with inattention or combined-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can improve the attention of these children. As part of the treatment, combined with other clinical, drug, and educational treatments, it will improve the related symptoms of children with ADHD.</p>
<p>Digital therapeutics prescription drugs are mainly guided by the two major drives of “development &amp; accomplishment” and “empowerment of creativity &amp; feedback”. Curiosity attracts children to play the game, and defeating challenges in the game obtains positive feedback, ultimately achieving the goal of improving attention.</p>
<p>However, although this will allow children to receive treatment faster than taking medicine, children with ADHD will become increasingly addicted to the game. In the trial, a few subjects even experienced side effects such as frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, nausea, or aggression. The occurrence of this side effect can be explained using the flow model.</p>
<p>Flow Model: Establish a coordinate system with personal skills as the X-axis and event challenges as the Y-axis to establish a flow model. When an individual’s skills are close to the challenges of the events they encounter, they will enter a state of flow. For the gaming industry, when a player’s skills are higher than the challenges presented by the game, the player will feel bored; and when the player’s skills are lower than the challenges presented by the game, the player will fall into anxiety. And the greater the gap between skills and the challenges presented by the game, the more obvious this feeling is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fb1becdde-b5e4-4b22-8cdf-d855acfbe2b5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;b1becdde-b5e4-4b22-8cdf-d855acfbe2b5.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 8: Flow Experience Model</em></p>
<hr>
<p>During the digital treatment process of children, if the challenges in the game are higher than the skills they can achieve, side effects such as nausea will occur. Not only EndeavorRx, but all games used as digital therapeutics prescription drugs should have a difficulty level closer to the level of the target player group, so that the recipients can stay in the flow state for as long as possible, maintain enthusiasm for the game, and achieve therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Ff75d004b-417c-4bed-b77c-fc2aace91b94.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;f75d004b-417c-4bed-b77c-fc2aace91b94.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Gamification is one of the most widely used methods in design. The rational use of game elements can solve problems in user experience or achieve explosive marketing effects. But no matter what kind of presentation form is adopted, it is only a means of construction. The core of gamification is to promote user participation, and the fundamental purpose is always to make users feel interesting, thereby stimulating their drive.</p>
