<h2 id="1-What-Do-Player-Surveys-Usually-Survey"><a href="#1-What-Do-Player-Surveys-Usually-Survey" class="headerlink" title="1. What Do Player Surveys Usually Survey?"></a>1. What Do Player Surveys Usually Survey?</h2><p>Long-time followers of NetEase ThunderFire UX should already be familiar with various user research methods from previous articles. Common user research methods include questionnaire surveys, user interviews, lab tests, focus groups, street intercept tests, etc. Research methods always revolve around the problems encountered in each stage of game development. We try to help solve various problems encountered by the product through player research. In the early stages of the game, we will investigate the current market situation and the needs of players for specific types of games; in rapid development, we will investigate whether the current core gameplay of the game is sufficiently competitive in the market, and whether the game’s novice guidance is smooth; after the game is launched, we will also investigate the opinions and needs of various players on the game.</p>
<p>All player research can be said to be goal-oriented. We need to draw clear and effective conclusions to better optimize the game. Because of this, we are so focused on any small problem in the game, and hope to improve the game’s new additions, payment, and retention by changing it. However, playing a game is a dynamic interaction process between the player and the game. Each player’s game behavior is not only affected by game factors, but also by the complex factor of “himself”. Before becoming a player, a player is already a living person, a complex individual who has already formed his own preferences and attitudes, and a social role with various social identities. It can be said that what kind of person a player is predicts what kind of behavior he will have. If you cannot jump out of the game itself to sensually understand the player, you cannot rationally understand the player’s various incredible behaviors in the game. However, this part of player research is often ignored, and is considered to be of little help in solving actual game problems.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Talk-to-Players-About-Life-in-Player-Research"><a href="#2-Why-Talk-to-Players-About-Life-in-Player-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Talk to Players About Life in Player Research?"></a>2. Why Talk to Players About Life in Player Research?</h2><p>As the years of doing user research work increase, we are increasingly “off-topic” when doing player research. We no longer only talk to players about games, but also start to talk to players about life. This seemingly inexplicable operation is due to the fact that all human behavior is determined by their own needs, and humans are social animals. To understand player needs, you must understand the player’s life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fa7fbda22-2f78-4674-ac93-06812daa3031.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;a7fbda22-2f78-4674-ac93-06812daa3031.png"></p>
<p>When doing MMO player research, we once came into contact with a player. His way of playing MMOs was very different from that of ordinary MMO players. He neither cultivated combat power nor participated in activities, but he was online for a very long time every day. Why is he so loyal to this game?</p>
<p>We tried to dig out some of his views on the game, but found that his evaluations of all the game systems were mediocre, just saying that the game atmosphere was very good. He just hangs up in the game every day, mainly to see if anyone is looking for him to chat, and then to see what everyone is saying in the guild channel. Such a game experience seems to be no fun at all in the eyes of ordinary people, but he has been playing like this for several years. Until we asked about his life status, he said that he is now the main source of income for the family and has great pressure at work, but this negative energy cannot be told to family and friends. Society does not seem to allow middle-aged men to admit their vulnerability, so he chose to talk to netizens in the game. “I can talk to friends in the game, purely to find someone to chat and talk to. We are friends when we are online, and we have our own lives when we are offline. We can comfort and tease each other.”</p>
<p>In this way, it is not difficult to understand that for him, the game is more of a place to relieve real-world pressure, and the quality of the gameplay is irrelevant to him, so he can play an MMO like a chat app. He is not attracted to other new games on the market with more diverse gameplay, so he can stay loyal.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Factors-Influence-Players’-Game-Motivation"><a href="#3-What-Factors-Influence-Players’-Game-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="3. What Factors Influence Players’ Game Motivation?"></a>3. What Factors Influence Players’ Game Motivation?</h2><p>Many researchers have explored how players’ game motivation affects their game behavior, and have divided players into different types based on their behavior. The most famous of these is probably Bartle’s player model, which divides players into Killers, Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers along four dimensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F169d9806-08f4-4487-a85c-99d593ffa574.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;169d9806-08f4-4487-a85c-99d593ffa574.png"></p>
<p>The X-axis is the object in the game, and the Y-axis is the method in the game. Simply put, killer players like to take action against players, and they are keen to defeat others; achiever players like to take action against the world, and they are happy to complete various tasks and goals in the game; social players like to interact with players, and they are even more interested in game players than in the game itself; explorer players like to interact with the game world, and they are happy to explore various contents in the game.</p>
<p>Quantic Foundry’s model extracts 12 player game motivations through cluster analysis, and divides players into 6 categories: “Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement, Immersion, and Creativity”. It will not be elaborated here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F5e2900cc-c1f4-4d2c-ab45-90292c506770.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;5e2900cc-c1f4-4d2c-ab45-90292c506770.png"></p>
<p>These models effectively help us understand players from the perspective of needs. We can know from them what specific needs in the game affect players’ behavior of playing games, that is, what players really want to do in the game.</p>
<p>In actual research, we found that players’ needs are not only affected by in-game factors, but also by out-of-game factors. If we go one step further and regard games as a kind of ordinary entertainment activity, and think about why players play games, we will find some interesting things. For example, players who choose to play games are not necessarily real gamers. Some out-of-game factors that we often ignore are also affecting players’ game motivation, including the player’s life status, and the player’s attitude and concept of the game.</p>
<p>We found that some players choose to play games out of real love. They believe that games give meaning to their lives and are the best way to mobilize energy. Correspondingly, they often have their own clear preferences and attitudes in game selection, and their behavior is relatively consistent. We can easily classify these players into one of the above player models.</p>
<p>Another part of players, when talking about games, regard games as a regulator of daily life. For them, games are not much different from other entertainment activities such as watching movies, and are mainly for relaxing themselves. These popcorn-type players often pay more attention to the visuals and excitement of the game, but may not have high requirements for gameplay. They are also relatively more susceptible to changes in life. For example, they may suddenly churn if they are busy recently, and may return without reason after being idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fbdb7d85c-feee-456d-abf0-bb4c144c2932.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;bdb7d85c-feee-456d-abf0-bb4c144c2932.png"></p>
<p>There are also some players whose gaming experience looks very complicated, and their gaming time seems to be very heavy. But once you ask carefully, you will feel that they do not have clear game preferences, and even their understanding of gameplay is not like that of a game player. Their words and deeds are always contradictory, so that it is difficult for you to classify them as any type of player in the above player model. These players are likely to regard games as social activities. They play games mainly influenced by friends around them, in order not to be out of touch with people around them. What they value is being able to play with friends around them, not the game itself. It is not difficult to understand why the games they choose are often very different; if you delve too much into their evaluation of a certain game, you will fall into a trap.</p>
<p>The MMO player exemplified above represents a large group of game players, that is, those who desire to escape from daily life. They may have the need to relieve pressure, and interesting game environments and low game thresholds are easy to attract them; they may also have unique emotional needs, wanting to find social connections in the game, or find their lost selves, so they pay more attention to whether the game is humane, rather than the quality of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F71702ff0-c797-4bdc-8228-24782c3acf36.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;71702ff0-c797-4bdc-8228-24782c3acf36.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-How-to-Talk-to-Players-About-Life"><a href="#4-How-to-Talk-to-Players-About-Life" class="headerlink" title="4. How to Talk to Players About Life"></a>4. How to Talk to Players About Life</h2><p>In the research, we found that the life status of players is a very difficult topic to talk about. Many players are reluctant to expose too much of their personal information in the research. In the actual operation process, the tips we use include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give players an opportunity to introduce themselves. A player who is willing to communicate with you about daily life will inadvertently reveal more of himself, and then you can follow his words to ask more potential information.</li>
<li>Ask about the player’s life status at the right time instead of asking directly. For example, when talking about the player’s views on daily activities, you can take the opportunity to understand whether the player’s life status is busy, and how much weight the game has in his life.</li>
<li>Communicate with players like a friend and give appropriate self-disclosure. Qualified user researchers should not express their own attitudes too much, as this may induce players, but there is no need to be a robot. Appropriate reactions will make players feel that they have met a game enthusiast and are more willing to communicate with you. More content will not be repeated here, and we will expand on it in the next article.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, all human behavior is motivated. We cannot talk about a player’s game behavior without his daily life, and we cannot talk about what is wrong with the game without the player himself. Player research itself is a big topic. Perhaps only by truly understanding the player’s life status and attitude towards life can we see the living players through the fog.</p>
