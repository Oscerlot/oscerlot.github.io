<h2 id="1-Game-Localization-Process"><a href="#1-Game-Localization-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Game Localization Process"></a>1. Game Localization Process</h2><h3 id="What-is-“Localization”"><a href="#What-is-“Localization”" class="headerlink" title="What is “Localization”?"></a>What is “Localization”?</h3><p>Actually, “localization” is not simply having the target language in a foreign game. The premise of localization is whether the game is open to the target region. Secondly, it is to modify and adjust the content in the game appropriately according to regional differences. Of course, the main content of localization work is to unify things that are well known abroad but little known domestically into popular domestic terms. This article will introduce what game localization is from several directions: process, cases, and market.</p>
<h3 id="The-usual-game-localization-process"><a href="#The-usual-game-localization-process" class="headerlink" title="The usual game localization process"></a>The usual game localization process</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1: Integration and analysis of game content.</strong> Combining the core gameplay and market conditions, the localization team obtains a player profile through a comprehensive assessment, and completes the rating of the game product at the same time. Regional differences breed different cultures. Usually, the localization team needs to integrate specific content in the game, such as text, audio, and some specific elements, and continue to follow up on subsequent translation and optimization after systematic analysis. According to the resources required for the localization project, overall analysis can not only clarify the project direction, but also help the project manager formulate project plans and promote budget execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2: Sorting and packaging of original game materials.</strong> Game materials related to localization needs usually include game code, audio, text, and even the introduction of the game background. In addition, a corpus is also essential, including Translation Memory, Term Bases, and Style Guide. Sorting and packaging the original materials can better provide them to the staff of the localization project and corresponding suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 3: Localization of game code.</strong> After confirming the code text that needs to be localized, extract the relevant strings in the game code and transfer them to the Translation Management System. In this process, if the code is not suitable for localization, or is not efficient enough and requires repeated work, thereby increasing labor costs, the code should also be iterated and optimized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 4: Integration of the translation management system.</strong> After the strings in the game code are entered into the translation management system, it is necessary to intervene in the translation platform or Computer Aided Translation tools to support translators in translation. In this process, if the translation management system has already integrated related auxiliary tools, then only need to add the translator to the system, and assign tasks to promote translation work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 5: Translator translation.</strong> The progress of translation can be detected from the translation management system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 6: Localization of other non-text elements.</strong> According to the player profile, target market culture, and needs, some elements of the game need to be adjusted and modified to suit the target audience. In this process, cultural taboo issues need special attention.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 7: Quality inspection.</strong> The quality inspection of translation includes grammar, spelling, semantics, and whether the terminology translation is consistent. After the translation is imported into the game and the integration is completed, it is also necessary to screen for functional bugs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 8: Integration and adaptation adjustment of localized content.</strong> Integrate the reviewed translated text with the completed localized game content. If functional bugs are found after screening, they need to be repaired and the adaptability of the UI user interface needs to be adjusted to ensure that the text can be displayed in the appropriate position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In game design, the earlier the localization needs are considered, the easier the subsequent localization work will be. In addition to the above steps, Thai localization also has some issues that require special attention, such as overlapping diacritic marks.</p>
<h2 id="2-Common-Localization-and-UI-Problems"><a href="#2-Common-Localization-and-UI-Problems" class="headerlink" title="2. Common Localization and UI Problems"></a>2. Common Localization and UI Problems</h2><h3 id="Incomplete-display-of-diacritic-marks-a-common-problem-in-Thai-games"><a href="#Incomplete-display-of-diacritic-marks-a-common-problem-in-Thai-games" class="headerlink" title="Incomplete display of diacritic marks, a common problem in Thai games"></a>Incomplete display of diacritic marks, a common problem in Thai games</h3><p>90% of Thai games have the problem of incomplete display of diacritic marks. Incomplete display of diacritic marks means that when vowels and tones are typed in the same position, they will often overlap in the same position, or the spacing is too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Ffb8b0434-f638-4eee-a588-749c42a52001.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;fb8b0434-f638-4eee-a588-749c42a52001.png"></p>
<p>From the picture above, we can see that the word in the rightmost part has overlapping diacritic marks, making it impossible to read the word normally.</p>
<p>This problem has long existed in many Thai games. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also had this problem during the Thai localization development stage. In order to successfully complete the localization of the Thai version of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the global localization team, the interaction experience design team, and the product program team worked together to provide a model for game globalization and efficient localization process. In fact, most Thai players know about this problem, but players don’t pay much attention to it unless it causes the original meaning of the word to change. For example, in the picture above, one of the diacritic marks of หมาป่าขนทอง (Rong Jin Wolf) disappears, resulting in the meaning becoming “dog throws golden Rong”. Once this type of problem is seen by players, it may be ridiculed. However, this problem was well solved during the localization process of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, making the localization quality of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in Thai receive more praise from players than other games. Therefore, players have a huge sense of intimacy with the game during the game experience, which has become one of the reasons why many Thai players choose <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Other-examples-of-game-localization-errors"><a href="#Other-examples-of-game-localization-errors" class="headerlink" title="Other examples of game localization errors"></a>Other examples of game localization errors</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fc6ba43c4-7963-4794-81bb-19b801b6062c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;c6ba43c4-7963-4794-81bb-19b801b6062c.png"></p>
<p><em>《Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment》</em></p>
<p><em>Sword Art Online</em> is a popular cross-media game, covering comics, animation, and video games, and it has gained a considerable number of fans in the West. <em>Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization</em> was listed as one of the best anime series games in 2017.</p>
<p>But its second part, <em>Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment</em>, has many problems in the Western market, and localization is one of them. From the picture, we can see that the customer said: Hey, is that black man sexually harassing the maid?</p>
<p>But in fact, the black man the customer said refers to the male protagonist Kirito in black, not a black man. In this scene, Kirito did not make any sexual harassment behavior. Such localization errors will seriously affect the player’s experience of the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Thailand’s-Gaming-Industry-Continues-to-Expand"><a href="#3-Thailand’s-Gaming-Industry-Continues-to-Expand" class="headerlink" title="3. Thailand’s Gaming Industry Continues to Expand"></a>3. Thailand’s Gaming Industry Continues to Expand</h2><p>Thailand’s 32 million gamers have helped the Thai game market generate more than approximately 6.8 billion RMB in revenue, making it one of the most watched game markets in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The normal growth rate of the Thai game market is an average of 10% per year. Due to the impact of the epidemic in 2020, the growth rate of the Thai game market has increased to 34.89%. According to the current situation where people are still staying at home, the growth rate of the Thai game market in 2021 should continue to increase to 15%. Therefore, the Thai game industry is constantly developing talent and building an ecosystem in the industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>2018 growth rate 13.78%</li>
<li>2019 growth rate 15.96%</li>
<li>2020 growth rate 34.89%, about 6.86 billion RMB</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the popularity of games in Thailand mainly started from mobile devices such as smartphones, and then spread to other platforms such as PCs or consoles. Mobile games have the highest share, at 4.203 billion RMB (divided into Android 2.215 billion RMB and iOS 1.988 billion RMB), followed by PC games at 1.646 billion RMB and console games at 957 million RMB.</p>
<h2 id="4-Thai-Players’-Game-Platform-Choice-Trend"><a href="#4-Thai-Players’-Game-Platform-Choice-Trend" class="headerlink" title="4. Thai Players’ Game Platform Choice Trend"></a>4. Thai Players’ Game Platform Choice Trend</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the preferred platform for Thai players is smartphones, and 95% of Thai players use mobile phones to play games. Mobile phones are the most popular platform in Thailand. According to Consumer Insights, most players also play games on consoles and PCs:</p>
<p>Among Thailand’s Internet users,</p>
<ul>
<li>95% of players play games on mobile phones</li>
<li>84% of players play games on PC</li>
<li>69% of players play games on consoles</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the data, female players prefer to play mobile games, while male players prefer to play games on other platforms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fd8cd6dc2-8ab5-4089-97b8-7882021a54de.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;d8cd6dc2-8ab5-4089-97b8-7882021a54de.png"></p>
<p>In the past 6 months, the vast majority of paying players (95%) will spend money on game props or virtual goods. The most frequently purchased props by men are playable characters (42%), and the most frequently purchased props by women are game currency (46%). Among all players, in-game currency is the prop with the highest purchase rate.</p>
<h2 id="5-Popular-Games-in-the-Thai-Market"><a href="#5-Popular-Games-in-the-Thai-Market" class="headerlink" title="5. Popular Games in the Thai Market"></a>5. Popular Games in the Thai Market</h2><p>Multiplayer competitive games, especially MOBA, Battle Royale, MMORPG, ARPG, and strategy games, are the most profitable in Thailand. Works based on popular game IPs also perform well. These top-ranked games increase user engagement and revenue by increasingly frequent game updates and in-game activities for Thai users. In addition, many of these games have an Asian-style art style due to the influence of the northern Asian market.</p>
<ul>
<li>45% of players in Thailand have played <em>Coin Master</em> in the past 6 months</li>
<li>About 44% of players have played <em>FIFA</em></li>
<li><em>FIFA</em> is more popular among men</li>
<li><em>Coin Master</em> is more popular among women</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Newzoo research, the favorite game type of Thai players is shooting games:</p>
<ul>
<li>38% of players play shooting games on mobile phones</li>
<li>35% of players play shooting games on consoles</li>
<li>34% of players play shooting games on PC</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes sense, because in the past 6 months, more than one-third of Thai players have played <em>GTA</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> (35% for each game). Considering the huge consumption potential of Thai players, it makes great sense to localize games for this emerging market.</p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>As it stands, the development trend of Thai games will continue to rise, and the proportion of player growth will also increase correspondingly. From the player growth rate of only 13.78% in 2018 to the instant increase to 34.89% in 2020, it is not difficult to see that Thai games still have a lot of room for development. Text is one of the parts that players have the most contact with. No matter how fun the game is, if players can’t understand the text, the game experience will be worse. Game localization is often misunderstood as simply copying and pasting with translation tools, but it actually involves many professional skills. In addition to being proficient in the corresponding language, localization staff also need to be very familiar with the product and the market. It is necessary to consider what kind of expression is most suitable for the target audience and avoid cultural conflicts and other problems.</p>
<p>Many game developers regard localization as the final link in the game development cycle. For them, this is like an extra step. But in fact, this approach is not wise, but will make the game miss the opportunity of overseas markets. When a product has not been localized and entered the local market, it may face a large number of copycat products in the local market, and thus return without success. If localization is carried out after similar situations occur, it will lead to the need to rewrite the source code and create translation materials. When players choose to experience new games, localization will also be one of the factors that players consider. Excellent localization is more like a reassurance. In addition to giving players a better gaming experience, it can also make players feel that the developers are making games with their hearts, so that players can feel more at ease when experiencing the game.</p>
