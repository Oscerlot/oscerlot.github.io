<h2 id="1-Match-3-Games-and-Their-Brief-History"><a href="#1-Match-3-Games-and-Their-Brief-History" class="headerlink" title="1. Match-3 Games and Their Brief History"></a>1. Match-3 Games and Their Brief History</h2><p>Elimination games are a type of puzzle game where players mainly win by matching and eliminating a certain number of identical game elements, such as fruits, gems, animal heads, building blocks, mahjong tiles, etc., so that they are adjacent to each other. Usually, three identical elements are matched and eliminated, so this type is also called “match-3 games”. Some match-3 games will add a development&#x2F;story, or management line on top of the elimination gameplay. Players obtain items through winning the elimination gameplay, and use them to upgrade buildings, improve character stats, etc.</p>
<p><em>Tetris</em> should be the earliest ancestor of elimination games, and <em>Dr. Mario</em>, later released by Nintendo after <em>Tetris</em>, can be said to be the prototype of match-3 type games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F887a0cc4-4973-4562-9b4a-c158f1206865.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;887a0cc4-4973-4562-9b4a-c158f1206865.png"></p>
<p>After that, games like <em>Bejeweled</em> and <em>Zuma</em> were released one after another. Richer elimination rules, gorgeous elimination feedback, and realistic elimination sound effects made the two games successful worldwide, pushing the match-3 game genre to the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F5a0d5792-25cb-4ccd-b16c-12541a63e20a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;5a0d5792-25cb-4ccd-b16c-12541a63e20a.png"></p>
<p>To this day, match-3 games have occupied a stable position in both domestic and foreign markets. In the “2021 China Game Industry Report” released by the China Game Industry Research Institute, elimination games accounted for about 4% of the market share of the top 100 mobile games by revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F2e5d54d9-9c08-4db9-b55a-3cdf96b31bed.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;2e5d54d9-9c08-4db9-b55a-3cdf96b31bed.png"></p>
<p>Overseas, elimination games have always occupied an important position in the mobile game best-selling list. According to DoF data, the global puzzle game market reached US$5.1 billion in 2020, of which elimination games accounted for US$3.76 billion (excluding China, Japan, and South Korea). Especially in the United States, elimination games are the largest segment of its mobile game market, and they are also an important region for domestic elimination game manufacturers to go overseas. According to GameRefinery data, elimination games accounted for 21% and 16% of the revenue of the US iOS game market in 2020 and May 2021, respectively. Among the Top 100 games on the US iOS best-selling list, elimination games account for about 15 games, among which King, Playrix, and Zynga, several major elimination game manufacturers, have occupied the main positions all year round.</p>

<h2 id="King’s-series-of-elimination-casual-games"><a href="#King’s-series-of-elimination-casual-games" class="headerlink" title="King’s series of elimination&#x2F;casual games"></a><em>King’s series of elimination&#x2F;casual games</em></h2><p>The core gameplay of match-3 games is actually not complicated, but the love of people all over the world for them can span decades. It seems that it will continue to be popular for decades to come. Why is it so attractive? We try to find some answers from the perspective of psychological mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="2-Elimination-Gameplay-Unit-Easy-to-Obtain-Instant-Reinforcement"><a href="#2-Elimination-Gameplay-Unit-Easy-to-Obtain-Instant-Reinforcement" class="headerlink" title="2. Elimination Gameplay Unit: Easy-to-Obtain Instant Reinforcement"></a>2. Elimination Gameplay Unit: Easy-to-Obtain Instant Reinforcement</h2><p>No matter how old the elimination game is, it always has several steps: “gathering the same color through operation (filling the same row in Tetris)”, “eliminating the same color blocks (the same row)”, and “increasing the score&#x2F;scoring numbers”, forming the smallest gameplay unit of the elimination game, and the process of the game is to constantly repeat this action. Every time you complete a gameplay unit, the game will give audio and visual prompts, such as the elimination animation and score display in the picture. Visually, the stacking of the same color naturally conforms to human perceptual fluency preferences, which will bring a sense of neatness and comfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fc102cfd2-1230-4109-a827-e72189391bfe.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;c102cfd2-1230-4109-a827-e72189391bfe.png"></p>
<p>While the elimination action is in progress, the game system will generate sound effects such as “great”, characters, and scores. In human culture, these all represent praise and are very direct positive feedback. In the current popular elimination games, there are even combo settings (the more you repeat the elimination action, the higher the score brought by the combo), and there are various functional blocks, which are more gorgeous and exaggerated in the effect of elimination, and can bring more attractive visual feedback. Even the remaining steps after each elimination round will have a fancy score settlement performance. All of them have increased the feedback after the elimination action, doubling the player’s pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F805611f4-3c48-4511-9587-d5bbe6c4a865.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;805611f4-3c48-4511-9587-d5bbe6c4a865.png"></p>
<p>From the perspective of psychological mechanisms, each elimination gameplay unit is a positive reinforcement - you make an action, and then immediately get a pleasant experience. Theoretical research on positive reinforcement has found that when people take a certain action, they can get a certain pleasant result from others, and this result in turn becomes a force to promote people to tend to or repeat this action. This is the basic principle of the core gameplay of elimination, which seems simple, but you always want to continue.</p>
<h2 id="3-Randomness-The-Joy-Written-in-the-Genes"><a href="#3-Randomness-The-Joy-Written-in-the-Genes" class="headerlink" title="3. Randomness: The Joy Written in the Genes"></a>3. Randomness: The Joy Written in the Genes</h2><p>Most elimination games, on top of the pleasant unit of elimination, have superimposed a layer of human’s joyful addiction written in the genes - randomness. In elimination games, the block matrix given to you at the beginning of each round is random, and the sequence of blocks that fall from above after elimination is also random. When you are lucky, you can randomly get some functional blocks at the beginning. For example, colored candies that can eliminate all blocks of the same color, striped blocks that can eliminate the entire row&#x2F;column, and coloring candies that can collectively change the color of blocks of a certain color. These props will reduce the difficulty of passing the level to varying degrees. When you are lucky, you can encounter a king-bomb opening - two adjacent colored candies. After they move each other, there will be a full-screen elimination effect, and you can even pass the level with full stars in one step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fb6f6c4a6-bbea-4acd-af2a-8986dce6219f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;b6f6c4a6-bbea-4acd-af2a-8986dce6219f.png"></p>
<p>This kind of random and unfixed experience is more addictive than fixed feedback. This effect is called intermittent reinforcement in psychology. Psychologist Skinner conducted a reinforcement experiment on rats. He designed a lever. As long as the rat stepped on the lever, food would fall. In the experimental group with constant food delivery, when the experimenter no longer delivered food and the rat did not get food by pressing the button, the rat’s established behavior habit would quickly disappear. In another control experiment, the experimenter changed the appearance mechanism of food to random dropping, and the rat also learned to keep pressing the button. Even if it takes dozens of uncertain presses to drop a piece of food, the rat will still maintain this behavior habit for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F14dc21f3-83a4-4ca7-bf1b-c52479b5caa8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;14dc21f3-83a4-4ca7-bf1b-c52479b5caa8.png"></p>
<p>This phenomenon is related to the mechanism of action of the brain’s reward mechanism. During the evolution of mankind, the brain has evolved a set of reward mechanisms that can associate certain situations with pleasure. In this way, we tend to try situations that may produce this experience again in the future from those learnings. The important substance in this is a neurotransmitter called “dopamine”, which is related to the mechanism of finding, searching, and judging that something can bring you happiness. Simply put, the role of dopamine is to “make you want” and let you choose behaviors that can get more rewards. The amount of dopamine has little to do with the amount of happiness after actually getting the result. Its main role is to make us have desires, thereby guiding corresponding behaviors.</p>
<p>After people’s behavior, the pleasant result obtained strengthens people’s expectation for the next behavior, and the intensity of this expectation is controlled by dopamine. When randomness is introduced, the player’s expectation is the randomly appearing reinforcement. When the player accidentally realizes an expectation, he will then crave the next realization, and so on. In this process, our nervous system will constantly predict the relationship between the current behavior and the next moment’s reward. When this prediction deviates, the brain will secrete dopamine to let all the neurons that make predictions change their expectations. In experiments, people found that the degree of dopamine secretion caused by “almost winning&#x2F;getting” is only slightly lower than that of “really winning&#x2F;getting”, which shows that human expectations and motivation for the next behavior are not completely one-to-one positively correlated with the result of the current behavior. “Almost winning&#x2F;getting” provides uncertain guidance for people, thereby continuously strengthening players’ behavior.</p>
<p>Simply put, before the result of randomness appears, people often have expectations for the result, and this expectation will accumulate with the increase of behavior. When expectations are realized, compared with certain results, uncertainty will make people secrete more dopamine, making you have a stronger desire, which will make the feedback mechanism more firmly strengthened.</p>
<p>Substituting into the smallest gameplay unit of elimination, after each sliding operation, we will get a block layout after elimination, but due to the randomness of the blocks falling from above, the block layout obtained after elimination is an uncertain event for us. Compared with the certain result of each sliding operation, the expectation that the next sliding operation can get powerful functional blocks will give us a stronger motivation to perform the next operation.</p>
<h2 id="4-Stamina-Restrictions-Avoiding-Desensitization-Caused-by-Hedonic-Adaptation"><a href="#4-Stamina-Restrictions-Avoiding-Desensitization-Caused-by-Hedonic-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="4. Stamina Restrictions: Avoiding Desensitization Caused by Hedonic Adaptation"></a>4. Stamina Restrictions: Avoiding Desensitization Caused by Hedonic Adaptation</h2><p>Players who often play elimination games will find that most elimination games have stamina restrictions. These stamina may recover one grid every 10 minutes, or one grid every 30 minutes. Every time you fail to pass a level, one grid of stamina will be deducted. After all stamina is deducted, you can no longer continue to pass the level. Of course, you can also continue to get the opportunity to pass the level by purchasing stamina. Every time the stamina is exhausted, we always feel itchy and want to say if we can play another round. When the game occasionally releases some unlimited stamina props for a limited time of 2 hours, you often find that you are getting more and more bored, without the excitement when the stamina was limited before, and become a mechanical elimination tool person. You can’t play for 2 hours of unlimited stamina at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F67891715-84d1-499d-b2bf-b8887e051b0a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;67891715-84d1-499d-b2bf-b8887e051b0a.png"></p>
<p>However, in this process, the excitement of the game has not changed, what has changed is your perception of the happiness of the game. This phenomenon is called hedonic adaptation. We can get happiness from doing something at the beginning, but as the number of times we do this thing increases, the happiness we feel each time will increase our expectations for the next time, and the next time we will need a greater intensity of experience to get the same level of happiness as before. When the elimination game brings happiness, the brain will secrete dopamine, making people look forward to continuing to eliminate the game and keeping people excited. When a stimulus is continuously input, the brain will continue to secrete dopamine. When dopamine-sending cells continuously pump out dopamine, the receiving nerve cells will cover their “ears” and reduce dopamine receptors (D2). This is the desensitization process that occurs in our brains, making people less desirous of a continuous stimulus. Of course, this is only a temporary desensitization. After a period of CD, the game will still make us feel happy. The stamina restriction in the game will interrupt people’s adaptation process to the happiness of the elimination gameplay, making the new game experience after full blood more valuable.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>This article only attempts to analyze the smallest gameplay unit in elimination games - the elimination level, and analyze the attractiveness of this category of gameplay from a psychological mechanism perspective for readers: the elimination behavior naturally conforms to human cognitive fluency preferences, and each elimination behavior unit is an instant reinforcement feedback; the ubiquitous randomness in the level strengthens people’s motivation for experience; the setting of limiting stamina reduces the hedonic adaptation brought by repeated fun. Of course, in addition to the above designs, elimination games also have a large number of elements such as scores, stars, and even development to increase the fun of the game, making the game more playable and longer-lasting.</p>
