</blockquote>
<p>On a normal weekend, have those of you planning to spend the day playing games ever suddenly wondered why the keys on the keyboard are not arranged in the order of ABCD? The keyboard we commonly use, with the first six letters of the first row being Q, W, E, R, T, Y, has also become the source of its name, the QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard family has many other unusual layouts aside from QWERTY.</p>
<p>With the principle of learning from our questions, today we will learn some obscure facts about keyboards, and the considerations for keyboard layout when designing the user experience of games. At the end of the article, we will provide several keyboard localization experience design solutions for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="1-QWERTY-a-Product-of-the-Typewriter-Era"><a href="#1-QWERTY-a-Product-of-the-Typewriter-Era" class="headerlink" title="1. QWERTY, a Product of the Typewriter Era"></a>1. QWERTY, a Product of the Typewriter Era</h2><p>To understand why today’s keyboards look the way they do, we need to trace back to the typewriter era. That’s right, the keyboard was introduced much earlier than the first computer, which appeared in the 1940s. In the early 19th century, people had already started using keyboards, but the keyboard initially adopted a layout with 26 letters arranged in a single row.</p>
<p>However, this terrible design was too inefficient. Some letter combinations obviously required typists to have advanced fingering skills to reach. So, apart from the inventor himself, few people used the world’s first typewriter keyboard. Soon after, new design solutions emerged to replace the original keyboard.</p>
<p>The person who eventually invented the familiar QWERTY keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes. There are two completely opposite versions of the story of his invention of QWERTY. One theory is that early typewriters would inadvertently speed up as people used them. If two adjacent letters were struck quickly, the two connecting rods would easily collide and jam. Sholes chose to separate the letters into discontinuous arrangements to reduce the typing speed of typists, thereby reducing the occurrence of failures. The other version says that Sholes observed that typists often had continuous keystrokes with one hand. When one hand was inputting frantically, the other was idle. The hand with continuous keystrokes was prone to fatigue and reduced speed. Sholes hoped to improve typing efficiency by alternating between left and right hands when typing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fcb6a88ff-5bd8-49f1-bf77-07598644927c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;cb6a88ff-5bd8-49f1-bf77-07598644927c.png"></p>

<h2 id="1878-QWERTY-Keyboard-Design-Diagram"><a href="#1878-QWERTY-Keyboard-Design-Diagram" class="headerlink" title="1878 QWERTY Keyboard Design Diagram"></a><em>1878 QWERTY Keyboard Design Diagram</em></h2><p>If the two theories are combined, the design goal of the QWERTY keyboard can be seen as “increasing speed as much as possible without jamming”. Sholes deliberately separated common letter combinations such as TH, HE, AN, IN, ON, AT, ND, ST, but also designed the ER accelerator key combination, and moved the commonly used letter T to the center and the less commonly used key Q to the edge.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happened in the past, such a seemingly strange and incomprehensible keyboard was born and continues to this day, becoming the most commonly used keyboard in our lives with the mysterious aura of one of the world’s top 100 unsolved mysteries.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-Else-is-There-Besides-QWERTY"><a href="#2-What-Else-is-There-Besides-QWERTY" class="headerlink" title="2. What Else is There Besides QWERTY?"></a>2. What Else is There Besides QWERTY?</h2><p>If you look closely at our keyboard, you will find that in addition to English letters and commonly used special characters, most characters of other languages cannot be typed normally. If you want to communicate with other friends in the global village, you need to use some minor language keyboards, which are usually redesigned on the basis of the QWERTY keyboard.</p>
<p>In addition to QWERTY, there are also minor language keyboards such as QWERTZ, AZERTY, and new keyboards such as Dvorak.</p>
<p>Take the French keyboard as an example. Compared with the universal QWERTY keyboard, in addition to letting the number keys also undertake the output tasks of vowels such as é, è, ç, à, the French keyboard also swaps the positions of A and Q, W and Z, and M comes to the right of L. Such changes may be due to the frequency of use of different letters. In French, the letters Q and Z appear more frequently than A and W. Choosing this arrangement can make finger movement more convenient and faster.</p>

<h2 id="French-keyboard"><a href="#French-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="French keyboard"></a><em>French keyboard</em></h2><p>Similarly, the German keyboard layout has been modified for frequency of use. Because TZ is often used as a root in German, the German keyboard swaps Y and Z.</p>

<h2 id="German-keyboard"><a href="#German-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="German keyboard"></a><em>German keyboard</em></h2><p>As for some other non-Latin languages, the keyboard styles are even more varied. Relying on unique keyboards and input methods, today’s keyboards have covered the needs of most language users.</p>

<h2 id="Korean-keyboard"><a href="#Korean-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Korean keyboard"></a><em>Korean keyboard</em></h2><p>In the years that QWERTY has dominated the market, many people have also tried to improve the keyboard layout. After all, the design of the QWERTY keyboard is not perfect. When using it, the left hand undertakes 14% more workload than the right hand (no wonder the author’s left hand always aches faintly when typing), and the usage rate of the middle row of letters is only 32%.</p>
<p>The most famous of these new keyboards is the Dvorak, born in 1936, and named after its designer, August Dvorak. The Dvorak keyboard reconsiders the frequency of English letters. All vowels are listed on the left and commonly used consonants are listed on the right, assigning 56% of the typing load to the right hand. It also utilizes the middle row that QWERTY abandoned, making the usage rate reach 70%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F05de5b87-f1d7-4561-af3c-eb0b8ace8df5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;05de5b87-f1d7-4561-af3c-eb0b8ace8df5.jpg"></p>

Keyboard Localized User Game Experience Design"></a>3. Keyboard Localized User Game Experience Design</h2><p>For players who use the QWERTY keyboard, using WASD to represent up, down, left, and right movement is already the default. But after learning the knowledge points above, we will find something is wrong. It is too unreasonable to require players who use minor language keyboards to adapt to WASD! We have compiled the following keyboard localization experience design solutions:</p>
<h3 id="Players-Manually-Reset-Keyboard-Keys"><a href="#Players-Manually-Reset-Keyboard-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Players Manually Reset Keyboard Keys"></a>Players Manually Reset Keyboard Keys</h3><p>Fortunately, most games today support user-defined keys in the key settings. Not only can minor language players adjust the key settings that best suit their keyboard layout, but some professional e-sports players or players who pursue higher skills can also adjust a set of personal optimal key combinations. For example, overseas players can set appropriate keys through custom keys when playing Naraka: Bladepoint. This degree of freedom has solved the problem of conflicting keyboard layouts to a certain extent, but just like Dvorak’s improvement to QWERTY, the improvement of the keyboard world has never stopped, and game designers are also seeking an optimal solution.</p>

The game either reads the input method once before starting, and the keys automatically adapt to the current keyboard settings, so you can play happily the moment you start the game. The key settings of APEX adopt this solution.</p>

<p>Although it saves users the trouble of additional operations, this method may also make some players suddenly find that their keys are “out of order” during passionate play. (Next time you encounter this situation, you can check if you accidentally switched the input method.)</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-“Key-Reset”-Button-Adjustment"><a href="#In-Game-“Key-Reset”-Button-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="In-Game “Key Reset” Button Adjustment"></a>In-Game “Key Reset” Button Adjustment</h3><p>In order to avoid this ghostly attack and allow users to confirm that they need to switch key settings, game designers have introduced another one-button strategy. The game can change the language at the automatic installation to change the key settings. Or the player can go to the “Settings” page and select “Key Reset” after starting the game. This method is currently the most common method on the market. The feedback is timely and the purpose is clearer.</p>
