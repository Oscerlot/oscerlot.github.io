<p>There are countless classic characters in video games, but we rarely see profound mother figures in games, and we rarely see gameplay themed around mothers. Where did the “mothers” in video games go? This requires us to think and inquire from multiple perspectives such as psychology, the game market, and the industry.</p>
<h2 id="1-Where-Did-Mom-Go"><a href="#1-Where-Did-Mom-Go" class="headerlink" title="1. Where Did Mom Go?"></a>1. Where Did Mom Go?</h2><p>May 8, 2022 (today), happens to be Mother’s Day.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when I was preparing this article, I actually intended to write about the glorious mother figures in games. Maternal love is always touching, and I thought it would be the same in games.</p>
<p>It’s just that when I racked my brains to search for the games I’ve played, the impressive game characters were often fathers. Whether it’s Joel in <em>The Last of Us</em> series, Atreus and his God of War father Kratos, the good dad Ethan in <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, or Kiryu Kazuma and Arakawa Masumi in the <em>Yakuza</em> series, players either act as good dads to take care of children, or have a good dad to lead them to grow.</p>
<p>So where did the mothers in the game go? The conclusion is: they either exist only in the game’s database and text records, or they exit the player’s adventure early. The better ones may still be at home waiting for you to come back (like mom in <em>Pokémon</em>), or send you a letter or some small specialties from time to time (like in <em>Animal Crossing</em> &amp; <em>Story of Seasons</em>); the worse ones may die in childbirth at the beginning, or die soon after as a plot device (<em>Tomb Raider</em>, <em>God of War</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fd5c306a2-0dcb-46ff-98d4-9e3ec3a13dd3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;d5c306a2-0dcb-46ff-98d4-9e3ec3a13dd3.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In Animal Crossing, Mom will periodically send letters to the player.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game developers seem to be finding ways to eliminate the role of mother from the game, as if mom is the biggest BOSS in the game. It makes me ask:</p>
<p>Why do we rarely see the image of “mother” in video games?</p>
<h2 id="2-Archetype-Theory-in-Psychology-and-Player-Experience"><a href="#2-Archetype-Theory-in-Psychology-and-Player-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. Archetype Theory in Psychology and Player Experience"></a>2. Archetype Theory in Psychology and Player Experience</h2><p>People’s perception of the image of “father” and “mother” is often influenced by “stereotypical” images in dramas, legends, and literary works. This subconscious perception of “father” and “mother” is a common phenomenon in different social cultures. The psychology giant Carl Jung defined such a collective subconscious or unconscious cognition of human beings as an “archetype”.</p>
<p>The “archetype” of the father represents an authority figure, strict and powerful; while the “archetype” of the “mother” represents love, care, enthusiasm, compassion, and tolerance. In layman’s terms, when we mention or see “mother” in works, we can often associate it with a gentle, amiable, hardworking, and understanding mother figure wearing an apron. When we think of “father”, we are more likely to portray a serious, unsmiling, tall, and powerful middle-aged man. This is the influence of “archetypes” on us.</p>
<p>In the field of games, most 3A masterpieces tend to bring players exciting adventures or adrenaline-pumping excitement, creating a sense of “insecurity” for players in terms of plot or gameplay. In the design of companion characters, if the player is always accompanied by a mother during the adventure, this sense of insecurity will be largely eliminated—it is difficult for us to imagine that when we are fighting with monsters, there is a mother next to us who keeps nagging “This is too dangerous, come home with me” or the mother steps forward to block in front of you and help you deal with all the problems. I’m afraid the game experience will not be very good.</p>
<p>In the design of the player’s own character image, the “father” image is often more favored by game producers than the “mother” image. Because the image of “father” often symbolizes a guide and strength, which is very consistent with the character image that game producers hope players can experience, and also conforms to the main line of the game that allows players to become stronger in RPG and other games. For example, in <em>The Witcher</em> we play as Geralt, relative to Ciri; in <em>God of War</em>, we play as Kratos, relative to Atreus; Lee in <em>The Walking Dead</em>, relative to Clementine, all are “carrying the burden of tradition, shouldering the dark gate, letting them go to the wide and bright place”.</p>
<p>Therefore, the comfort and coziness brought by the mother image is incompatible with the rebellious and adventurous spirit advocated by most video games, just like a 13-year-old rebellious teenager and his mother.</p>
<p>Of course, not all games use the father’s role as the protagonist. <em>UNDYING</em> for example. Under the ravages of zombies, you, as the protagonist Anling, resist the virus while taking care of your young child Cody in a difficult environment. What the game wants to express is not the common survival and adventure, but the greatness of maternal love. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the mother as the protagonist.</p>

<h2 id="3-Target-Audience-and-Game-Types"><a href="#3-Target-Audience-and-Game-Types" class="headerlink" title="3. Target Audience and Game Types"></a>3. Target Audience and Game Types</h2><p>Another very intuitive but very important factor is the target audience of the game.</p>
<p>In the traditional video game market, male players are often the mainstream. Therefore, for most game manufacturers, it is a very natural thing to target male players and launch male protagonists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of the internet-addicted youths who used to be in arcades or using NES, Windows 95 or Windows 98 are now fathers. NGA, the main base of <em>World of Warcraft</em> players, has also gradually opened up a parenting section in the past few years. The former guild leaders are asking around in the section what kind of milk powder is best for their children. The former 24-hour online internet cafe teenagers complain about their less than one hour of game time every day. These players are still an important audience for games, so we can often see classic game works of “male mothers”.</p>
<p>Conversely, in those purely female-oriented games, or games with a large number of female players, and games that pay more attention to the female game market, the mother element is often more profound. This is more common in many social MMO games or simulation games that focus on life simulation. For example, in <em>Justice Online</em>, there is a baby-raising gameplay, where female characters can be pregnant for ten months and finally give birth to their own baby, becoming a veritable “mother”. Players not only need to pay attention to their physical condition during pregnancy, but also need to help them grow even after the child grows up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fa32d9de3-0694-4f0f-8b6c-e794ded8e75d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;a32d9de3-0694-4f0f-8b6c-e794ded8e75d.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The baby-raising gameplay added in the “Wulin Mengzhu” expansion of Justice Online</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simulation games, it is even more straightforward. <em>Be My Mom</em> on Steam brings you a one-stop experience of being a mother from pregnancy, childbirth, preparing milk powder and diapers, cleaning poop, and creating a baby room. In addition, there will also be some games that are not “mothers” in name but are almost the same as playing mothers, such as the popular casual game <em>Travel Frog</em> a few years ago. Players prepare the frog’s travel backpack, and the frog sets off on its own. You don’t know when it will come back, and you’re not sure what it will bring back to you, which gives people a feeling of “before leaving, the dense stitches, worrying about the late return”.</p>

<h2 id="4-The-Perspective-and-“Selfishness”-of-Game-Practitioners-and-Producers"><a href="#4-The-Perspective-and-“Selfishness”-of-Game-Practitioners-and-Producers" class="headerlink" title="4. The Perspective and “Selfishness” of Game Practitioners and Producers"></a>4. The Perspective and “Selfishness” of Game Practitioners and Producers</h2><p>The last point that has to be admitted is that many games are also largely influenced by game practitioners or producers in the choice of mother or father roles.</p>
<p>The <em>Yakuza</em> series has many classic good dad-type characters, such as the classic protagonist Kiryu Kazuma. But if we want to find a memorable mother figure in the game, you will suspect that the worldview of <em>Yakuza</em> is that men have children. For the reason for this phenomenon, when we see the photo of the producers of the <em>Yakuza</em> studio, we will generally understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F1c541a66-0e58-46e3-b6ed-918006aca64f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;1c541a66-0e58-46e3-b6ed-918006aca64f.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Group photo of the new Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A domestic report disclosed by Gamma Data in 2017 also showed that the number of male game practitioners is about three times that of female game practitioners. The male-dominated game industry naturally cannot avoid the trend of male perspectives dominating game production. It is difficult for these rough men to tell a story about mothers, unless the company’s leader is Patrick Star.</p>
<p>Of course, the gender bias of game practitioners themselves is one reason, and the “selfishness” of individual producers often also affects the amount of mother or father elements.</p>
<p>Neil Druckman, one of the producers of <em>The Last of Us</em>, became a father during the game’s production. He also frankly stated that his daughter gave him great inspiration in portraying the “father-daughter” relationship between Ellie and Joel. He realized the importance of family and was “willing to do anything for his daughter”, which also affected the development of the game’s related plot.</p>
<p>Cory Barlog, the producer of <em>God of War</em>, also said in an interview that he projected his own image onto the protagonist Kratos. He is usually busy with work and cannot be with his children. Any parent will feel confused about how to educate their children and is always looking for changes, just like Kratos and Atreus in the game. In addition to the father, the image of the mother will also be affected by “selfishness”. On Mother’s Day in 2020, Paradox uploaded a promotional video for its upcoming game <em>Empire of Sin</em> on its YouTube channel. The reason for choosing Mother’s Day for promotion is that one of the female mafia godmothers in the game is based on the great-grandmother of the game producer Romero couple - they want to commemorate their great-grandmother in this special way and express their respect for Mother’s Day.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, the reasons why we rarely see the existence of mother figures in games are: on the one hand, many games themselves are not suitable for the existence of “mothers”. The sense of security and attachment that “mothers” bring to players is incompatible with the adventurous and rebellious spirit of video games; on the other hand, it is also the choice of the game market. The male-dominated game market also determines that the “mother” element is difficult to resonate with and be substituted by players; finally, the gender differences of game practitioners themselves and some selfishness of game producers also inevitably affect the overall design of the game.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, as the gender ratio of the game industry and the game market has gradually become balanced, more rich and diverse game types and themes have emerged. The high wall that keeps “mothers” away from games is constantly collapsing. We have indeed seen more and more “mothers” shine in games, and more and more games have begun to design gameplay with a mother’s perspective. Whether it’s Ana in <em>Overwatch</em> or Mad Maggie in <em>Apex Legends</em>, game producers are also practicing such a truth:</p>
<p>Video games themselves do not exclude the existence of “mothers”. Whether the image in the game is “mother” or “father” is determined by what kind of experience the player wants to have.</p>

<p>If one day we want to experience a warm and comfortable journey in the game, it is not impossible to join a nagging mother to accompany you.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to dedicate this article to all mothers in the world, Happy Mother’s Day!</p>
