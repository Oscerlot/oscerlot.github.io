<p>Movie subtitles, as frequent visitors to the big screen, have a profound impact on the film and television industry. But when we turn our attention to game subtitles, the situation seems a bit subtle. Players immersed in the audio-visual feast may often not notice the small subtitles, and sometimes even think that subtitles are obstacles that hinder them from taking screenshots and enjoying the game. In some games that do not pay much attention to UI design, game subtitles may be routinely delisted. You may ask: Is it wrong to look for subtitles in the game world? But perhaps, there are far more design points in game subtitles than you think.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Past-and-Present-of-Game-Subtitles"><a href="#1-The-Past-and-Present-of-Game-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="1. The Past and Present of Game Subtitles"></a>1. The Past and Present of Game Subtitles</h2><h3 id="1940s-The-Era-of-Title-Cards"><a href="#1940s-The-Era-of-Title-Cards" class="headerlink" title="1940s: The Era of Title Cards"></a>1940s: The Era of Title Cards</h3><p>Have you ever thought about this question: In the past when computer technology and digital photography were underdeveloped, in the era of film and even silent films, how did subtitles appear?</p>
<p>Before the subtitles we are familiar with now were born, filmmakers printed important subtitles on the bottom plate to make “title cards”, which were photographed and inserted into the movie sequence frames to express key plot content. The era when “title cards” flourished was the golden age of silent films. The unique advantage of title cards is that the translation of movies becomes very easy. Filmmakers only need to remove and replace the title cards to complete the translation of the movie. Behind the small title cards is the export of a large number of films and the spread and penetration of culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fb2bf25fa-9332-4a5e-bbe1-5e1f5267f716.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;b2bf25fa-9332-4a5e-bbe1-5e1f5267f716.png"></p>

<p><em>Title card in a Chaplin film</em></p>

<p>Technology brings development, and demand brings progress. Sound films, a rich form, soon appeared, and title cards gradually withdrew from the public eye. But before the producers had time to celebrate the innovation of film technology, the difficulty of film translation followed. If you want to export your own movies, whether it is remake or dubbing, the cost is extremely high. It can be said that demand forces progress. Less than two years after the advent of sound films, subtitle technology was born and has been continuously iterated and evolved in the following years.</p>
<h3 id="1980s-CC-Subtitles-and-Accessibility-Design"><a href="#1980s-CC-Subtitles-and-Accessibility-Design" class="headerlink" title="1980s: CC Subtitles and Accessibility Design"></a>1980s: CC Subtitles and Accessibility Design</h3><p>As mentioned above, the emergence of subtitles was originally to make movies easier to watch and more efficient to spread. It is foreseeable that the emergence of subtitles will not only erase cultural boundaries, but also break the shackles of disability.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, a more detailed subtitle form with auxiliary functions, “Closed Captioning”, was born, which was later known as “CC subtitles”. In this kind of subtitles, not only the dialogue of the characters will be presented, but also the key music, sound effects, and the name and even the corresponding position of the speaker in the scene will be marked, so that people with hearing impairment can also enjoy the program content. Apple’s products and promotional videos have provided good support for CC subtitles, and bilibili in China also provides CC subtitle options.</p>

At the end of the 20th century, with the rapid improvement of the game industry in technology and thought, subtitles, a very functional component, and some established usage rules were also extended to game products.</p>

<p><em>Game “Half-Life”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This is also an important node in the history of games. The famous id Software developed and shared the Quake engine, and Valve created its first game “Half-Life” based on it. “Half-Life” is a brand new type of game with cinematic narrative, coherent level design, a lot of dialogue and descriptive text. Because of this, many unexpected problems also appeared, including the embarrassing situation that the experience was affected because the dialogue could not be heard clearly. Early games did not have a lot of plots and descriptions, and did not rely on text for assistance, so naturally there was no such problem. Fortunately, there were experts among the people. Due to the convenience of the Quake engine, excellent subtitle mods and other mods continued to emerge, which improved the game experience and added fuel to the development of game subtitles.</p>
<h3 id="Today-From-Subtitles-Default-Off-to-Subtitles-Default-On"><a href="#Today-From-Subtitles-Default-Off-to-Subtitles-Default-On" class="headerlink" title="Today: From Subtitles Default Off to Subtitles Default On"></a>Today: From Subtitles Default Off to Subtitles Default On</h3><p>For players of the millennial generation, subtitles in games seem to be there by nature. They are like air. You often hardly notice their existence. Only when you are “short of breath” (can’t see the subtitles clearly) will you curse the game interaction designer. But we can see from the above that game subtitles did not exist at the beginning, and there has been a lot of experience from the default off of game subtitles to the default on of game subtitles.</p>
<p>At the beginning of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the protagonist John, sitting on the train, listens to the chatter of men, women and children in the carriage, thus introducing the entire game world. However, if you are a player who is not good at listening, this group dialogue is more like a lullaby, so that you have to turn on the subtitles and watch it again. This situation was not uncommon at that time, because many games maintained the habit of “subtitles default off”. Today, many games, including <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, default game subtitles on. This change in status also reflects that the status of subtitles is gradually improving, and developers are becoming more and more user-friendly.</p>
<p>For normal users, their hearing is sufficient to support them to understand the content without turning on subtitles. But in special cases, such as when the surrounding environment is very noisy and the player has difficulty concentrating on listening, subtitles will be very valuable.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also conclude from the history of subtitle development that there are four scenarios suitable for game subtitles: for games with localization needs, for players with hearing impairments to play games, for intense and exciting games where users cannot concentrate on listening, and for playing games in noisy environments.</p>
<h2 id="2-Common-Problems-in-Game-Subtitle-Design"><a href="#2-Common-Problems-in-Game-Subtitle-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Common Problems in Game Subtitle Design"></a>2. Common Problems in Game Subtitle Design</h2><h3 id="Font-Size"><a href="#Font-Size" class="headerlink" title="Font Size"></a>Font Size</h3><p>The first is the choice of text size. If the font is too large, it will block the line of sight; if the font is too small, it will be difficult for players to distinguish the dialogue content of the game. For developers, the most important thing to consider is that for different players and different game devices, the suitable font size is not the same. For example, some players may have high-performance hosts and a super-large curved screen in front of them when playing games; while some players may only be able to let their small and thin laptops bear the burden. Therefore, the best solution is that the developers have considered these factors during testing, and tested the game effects under different game devices and playing distances, and ensured the readability of the text in most cases. Of course, you can also add custom options for users so that they can choose the text size themselves. But I personally think that the best solution is to let the developers complete the 99 steps of the design, such as making highly versatile designs or self-adaptive designs, and players do not need to make too many choices or changes for comfort.</p>
<p>We can also learn from the established norms of other industries. Amazon’s UI guidelines stipulate that 1080p, UI text uses a minimum of 28px. Channel 4 in the UK requires that all high-definition subtitle specifications should be 46px, and standard definition should be 26px.</p>
<h3 id="Contrast"><a href="#Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Contrast"></a>Contrast</h3><p>In subtitle design, it is very important that the text needs to have a high contrast with the background to ensure that the text is easy to read. Sometimes, as the game background changes, the text will be blurred because it is too close to the background color. The general and most economical solution is to add a dialog box. The translucent dialog box can ensure the high contrast between the text and the background without destroying the game screen. Some games also use the text color to change with the background to improve the contrast. For example, the game <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, which will be discussed later, its text will change in real time with the different colors of the scene to ensure that the text is readable throughout the process.</p>
<p>Designers need to pay special attention to the use of red, because for most color-blind players, red will appear dark brown.</p>
<h3 id="Too-Much-Text"><a href="#Too-Much-Text" class="headerlink" title="Too Much Text"></a>Too Much Text</h3><p>When arranging text content, you should avoid presenting too much text at one time, which will not only affect the game experience, but also cause reading difficulties. Line-by-line typesetting and reasonable sentence breaks can greatly improve readability. Line-by-line typesetting needs to control a single subtitle to about two lines; reasonable sentence breaks are based on natural pauses, plus the punctuation marks of the sentence.</p>
<p>Game subtitles can also learn from the standards of the television industry in various countries or regions. If it is really necessary to present subtitles in multiple lines, the first line should be the longest, but at the same time, the length of each line should be roughly the same.</p>
<h3 id="Automatic-Mode"><a href="#Automatic-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Automatic Mode"></a>Automatic Mode</h3><p>I believe that everyone has had the experience of turning on the automatic playback mode because they had to free their hands to eat snacks when going through the plot, and the playback speed here is also something that developers need to consider. Different players have different reading speeds. For example, for children, they need more time to read the same text. The reading speed needs to consider most players, and relevant literature or established UI design specifications can be referred to. The most ideal state is to set multiple speeds for players to choose.</p>
<h2 id="3-Advanced-Usage-Guide-for-Game-Subtitles"><a href="#3-Advanced-Usage-Guide-for-Game-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="3. Advanced Usage Guide for Game Subtitles"></a>3. Advanced Usage Guide for Game Subtitles</h2><p>After talking about the basic part of subtitle design, let’s take a look at the advanced application tutorial examples of subtitle design - <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>. From the purpose and effect of subtitles, I divide them into three categories: assisting immersive experience, guiding players’ vision, and enhancing the sense of game interaction.</p>
<h3 id="Auxiliary-Immersion-Experience"><a href="#Auxiliary-Immersion-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Auxiliary Immersion Experience"></a>Auxiliary Immersion Experience</h3><p>(1) Floating Subtitles</p>
<p>The most intuitive way in the game is to present the main plot of the game with a large number of floating subtitles. These floating subtitles appear on the player’s travel route, allowing the player to experience the feeling of deepening in time and space with the plot. At the same time, these subtitles will also take into account the player’s current perspective. For example, in Molly’s story, the Molly played by the player finally becomes a snake. At this time, the arrangement of subtitles is based on the snake’s perspective.</p>

<p>(2) Text Reading</p>
<p>The large background narration and story description in the game are presented in the form of letters. The player seems to have really become a person in the game, reading the text that can be flipped through and written in the game, rather than reading the subtitles at a fixed position on the screen. For example, at the beginning of the game, the protagonist played by the player opens the diary left by his mother on the boat and learns about the past stories of the family; in Barbara’s story, the player reads Barbara’s story by reading the comics. The design of the text is also the style of comic-style dialog boxes, or exaggerated onomatopoeia. Every time the player experiences the story of a family member, he will open the diary he carries with him and draw a portrait of this person on the family tree, and this interface is also our menu interface.</p>

<p>(3) Text Transition</p>
<p>The way players enter or exit the story of a family member is by reading the letters or reports left by him or his relatives and friends found in his room. The text transition is very smooth and easy to make people feel that they are not finished.</p>

<p>For example, Walter, goes outside after 30 years. He sees the light, but at the same instance, is taken by a train.</p>

<h3 id="Visual-Guidance"><a href="#Visual-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Visual Guidance"></a>Visual Guidance</h3><p>(1) Guiding Items</p>
<p>The most commonly used method in the game is to place relevant plot subtitles around related items, plus a certain forced perspective conversion, to achieve the role of emphasizing and pointing to specific items. At the same time, this method is also used to guide interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F7acc3bff-969c-4c72-8a6d-91b38a6cedbc.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;7acc3bff-969c-4c72-8a6d-91b38a6cedbc.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F2f4b9eae-1ef8-4775-a264-0b93f825de44.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;2f4b9eae-1ef8-4775-a264-0b93f825de44.gif"></p>
<p>The position of the subtitles guides the player to the tent in the corner, so that the player unknowingly completes the content of blowing over the tent in the plot. The player’s surprise when the effect is triggered unconsciously is exactly what the designer hopes the player will empathize with the protagonist in the game.</p>
<p>(2) Text Disappearing Effect</p>
<p>The special effect of text disappearing can also be used to make a big fuss. For example, in order to guide the player to make the action of “lying on the peephole and looking into the room”, the designer makes the disappearing effect of the relevant plot text be sucked in by the peephole, naturally guiding the player to the peephole. And the entrance to the underground cave is in a very remote place in the player’s initial perspective, and the game also guides the player to find the entrance through the text disappearing effect.</p>

<p>(3) Enhancing Game Interaction</p>
<p>The interactivity of subtitles is also a unique part of this game. Some interactive texts can greatly enhance the player’s gaming experience. For example, as the player pushes open the fence, the text is scattered on the ground, giving the player feedback and bringing a different kind of small surprise. The player manipulates the kite to return the plot text to its place, so that the player can empathize with the character who is flying the kite while thinking richly. The text plays the perspective of the rock, and as the Walter played by the player smashes the underground cave, it rises and falls and is finally smashed.</p>

The Future of Game Subtitles: How to Design VR Subtitles"></a>4. The Future of Game Subtitles: How to Design VR Subtitles</h2><p>When talking about the development history of subtitles earlier, it is easy for us to find that demand drives progress. The emergence of VR games and the demand for VR subtitles naturally also require designers to master certain VR subtitle design points. From the most basic readability and comfort, designers need to consider not only the text itself, but also the presentation of text by VR hardware and the space where the player is located is no longer a comfortable sofa and a super large display, but a heavy head-mounted device and a dizzying panoramic space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Ff9419c4b-97fa-4561-a130-4badbf6c56ae.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;f9419c4b-97fa-4561-a130-4badbf6c56ae.png"></p>

<p><em>Subtitles in the VR game “Half-Life: Alyx”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From the perspective of readability, the first thing to pay attention to is the distortion of the space in VR. Designers cannot simply place two-dimensional UI information directly, but need to redesign the interaction method and interaction range according to the VR operation characteristics and habits. At the same time, different from flat two-dimensional design, the unique property of VR is the depth of field (Z axis). The Z axis expands the possibility of interaction forms, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the physiological characteristics of players having difficulty focusing when the Z axis distance is too far. Secondly, there is the problem of resolution. Since the current VR standards for various platforms are not uniform, the resolution of elements in some platforms is extremely low, and thin lines are prone to serious jagged problems. Therefore, interactive designers should avoid line-shaped icons and fonts that are too small and too thin. Finally, there is the design of dynamic effects, which should not only avoid competing for the attention of the theme information, but also pay attention to the fact that excessive dynamic effects in the VR environment are more likely to make users dizzy.</p>

<p><em>Interactive Guidance in “Half-Life: Alyx”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From the perspective of comfort, thousands of words can be summed up in one sentence: reduce head movement to reduce dizziness. Since the VR screen has no edges, designers need to place elements and interactions within the field of view as much as possible, so that users do not need to turn their heads hard. In places with frequent interaction, try to reduce the amplitude of dynamic effects, avoid narrowness or excessive brightness, and reduce users’ dizziness and visual fatigue. At the same time, for moving street scenes or objects, try to adopt a constant speed to avoid users suffering from motion sickness.</p>
