<p>Unlike other action-oriented buy-to-play games that pursue a sense of excitement, most buy-to-play otome mobile games are in AVG (Adventure Game) format, and some game systems have even been simplified to “audiobooks.” It seems more accurate to describe the gaming experience as “reading an e-book” rather than “playing a game.” However, even though the system has been simplified to an e-book, and the golden age of around 2011 has passed, buy-to-play otome games still have stable sales both domestically and internationally. Some people will definitely ask: “Why do these players spend 600 yuan to buy a game that lacks a sense of game operation and is similar to an e-book mode?” This article will analyze the purchasing factors of buy-to-play otome game players.</p>
<h2 id="1-Exquisite-Art-Style"><a href="#1-Exquisite-Art-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Exquisite Art Style"></a>1. Exquisite Art Style</h2><p>Compared with other games, standalone otome games often have higher-quality character art, with a delicate and exquisite style. Buy-to-play players often pay attention to the NPC characters in the game from head to toe, from outerwear to accessories. Whether it is Western fantasy, steampunk, or historical drama, popular otome games often have handsome character designs and excellent artwork. Buy-to-play games often create a complete game world for players, where each character will satisfy the aesthetic fantasies of general women, representing the highest aesthetic level of players. In addition, many players also have their own requirements for the exquisiteness of the game UI: the color scheme should be tasteful, and the font should be beautiful and easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>Many game companies are also aware of this demand from players and have put a lot of effort into the iterative update of art style. Many large game manufacturers have even cultivated special artists for buy-to-play otome games. Looking at the current buy-to-play otome games, we can feel that the characters tend to be beautiful, from hair design to clothing matching, all have been carefully designed; not only that, the UI design also incorporates the color elements that female players like, and incorporates the game elements that female players like.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>The fantasy game “Cendrillon palikA” and the vampire-themed “DIABOLIK LOVER” have very exquisite character designs.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fc8f7a99f-939e-42df-af32-5b954fe8923e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;c8f7a99f-939e-42df-af32-5b954fe8923e.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The game UI of “Cendrillon palikA” uses a lot of dreamy pink and purple elements, which has been well received by players.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-Luxurious-Voice-Actors"><a href="#2-Luxurious-Voice-Actors" class="headerlink" title="2. Luxurious Voice Actors"></a>2. Luxurious Voice Actors</h2><p>In addition to exquisite graphics, another feature of the standard configuration of buy-to-play otome games is the full voice-over system. In the absence of gameplay, the voice acting of voice actors is one of the players’ gaming experience points, so the current voice acting market for buy-to-play otome games is also becoming increasingly competitive. Players require that the voice should fit the character itself, and they also require that this voice actor needs to have a certain popularity and have certain achievements in the industry.</p>
<p>Unlike many luxurious voice actors in China, whose voices tend to be uniformly “seductive,” Japanese male voice actors often tend to have more diverse voice acting styles due to their large number and the great differences in players’ preferences. Whether it is a refreshing boy, a mysterious person who is both righteous and evil, or a noble royal family, you will always find well-known voice actors who fit the character setting to cooperate. In the game, a fitting voice can bring players a more immersive enjoyment.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Otome games often have quite luxurious voice actor lineups, and many voice actors have millions of fans.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fd4322467-1623-4f05-b9e5-bc81c3879a5d.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;d4322467-1623-4f05-b9e5-bc81c3879a5d.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many players of standalone otome games will give the game a good review because of the superb performance of the voice actors.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-Character-Designs-That-Match-Their-Own-Aesthetics"><a href="#3-Character-Designs-That-Match-Their-Own-Aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="3. Character Designs That Match Their Own Aesthetics"></a>3. Character Designs That Match Their Own Aesthetics</h2><p>The number of capturable characters in a buy-to-play single-price otome game is not very large, generally maintaining a level of around 6. However, the personalities of the characters are often individual and distinct. For example, a game will never have two presidents, nor will it have two characters with hidden darkness. Attributes such as sharp-tongued, tsundere, and natural will often appear reasonably and be integrated into a game. Players will always find their favorite object in the game. Many game manufacturers even release FD sequels in works other than the main story. In FD, they will add capturable game objects to attract fans of the character designs of Subs (non-capturable NPCs) in the main story to purchase and experience the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F8e97deb2-ea50-4043-aba6-2fa930691493.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;8e97deb2-ea50-4043-aba6-2fa930691493.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In the buy-to-play otome game “Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly,” the character designs of the capturable objects do not overlap.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-Powerful-Script"><a href="#4-Powerful-Script" class="headerlink" title="4. Powerful Script"></a>4. Powerful Script</h2><p>The script is half the battle of a buy-to-play otome game. With the assistance of voice acting and art, the scriptwriter needs to show players a unique worldview. Buy-to-play otome games often have a huge amount of text, often requiring players to spend 50 hours to complete the game. Many otome games will hire professional light novel writers or professional writers to create the script, and the game will have different manifestations due to the personal style of the scriptwriter. Buy-to-play standalone games include not only relatively close-to-life script frameworks such as “Stardom 2” and “Tokimeki Memorial Girl’s Side,” but also script worlds with bizarre plots such as Hyakki Yagyō (Night Parade of One Hundred Demons), vampire families, or Snow White dark fairy tales. Whether you are a fan of realism or a fan of fairy tales and legends, you can experience the fun of the game in buy-to-play otome games.</p>
<p>It is precisely because buy-to-play otome games are infinitely close to the e-book mode that the script will largely determine the player’s experience. If a game’s script has flaws, such as unclear logic or an anticlimactic ending, then players will rate the work lower. On the contrary, among a group of beautiful men and women, games with strong and reasonable scripts often become classics and white moonlight in the hearts of players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fdea1878a-b35d-404d-84fa-0d772ba3a678.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;dea1878a-b35d-404d-84fa-0d772ba3a678.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players of buy-to-play otome games will make decisive evaluations of works based on the script.</em></p>

<h2 id="5-Communication-with-Like-Minded-People"><a href="#5-Communication-with-Like-Minded-People" class="headerlink" title="5. Communication with Like-Minded People"></a>5. Communication with Like-Minded People</h2><p>Around 2010, the main forum for female-oriented games, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.yumemori.com/index.php">Yume100</a>, had a large number of female-oriented game enthusiasts. The forum had very advanced and detailed classifications: otome games&#x2F;yuri games&#x2F;BL, all ages&#x2F;non-all ages were reasonably divided; in addition to game resources, the forum also had players’ clearance thoughts, drama resources, and the latest event information. It can be said that, with a membership to [Yume100], you could get the most advanced information on Japanese female-oriented games. Because the website’s server is small and has high requirements for capacity, registering as a member of [Yume100] requires layers of review, and being rejected is also commonplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fb5e3b6c7-61fb-4f2f-aaba-00019142eab9.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;b5e3b6c7-61fb-4f2f-aaba-00019142eab9.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In the Q&amp;A of Zhihu: “How to evaluate the female-oriented forum Yume100?”, some respondents said that they had been rejected three times in a row.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the high membership threshold, replying to content such as “up” and “thank you” on other forum pages is almost impossible on [Yume100]. In order to reduce the load on the server, over time, the [Yume100] forum has the default rule of “no water posts, replies must be more than XX words.” Therefore, [Yume100] has gathered the most sincere and persistent standalone game players, where they conduct sincere game discussions, and through discussions and exchanges, the most core players are retained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fd896dc94-fe07-4f1e-a247-390152afff56.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;d896dc94-fe07-4f1e-a247-390152afff56.png"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>In the Yume100 forum, you can often see members writing small essays to discuss female-oriented game related topics.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the emergence of new social platforms such as Weibo, players of buy-to-play games also moved some of their discussions and social activities to Weibo and communities. On Weibo, you can buy and sell second-hand game cartridges, purchase in groups, or make friends with like-minded people in super topics with tags. In the search list of communities, by searching for specific words such as “otome game” and “standalone game”, you can also find many active groups of hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Players will make friends spontaneously through Weibo or communities. Only by playing the game will they have a common topic and maintain a relationship. Therefore, under the influence of this small circle culture, players will buy the game itself, complete the game, and communicate and interact with like-minded people.</p>

Smooth Reading Experience Brought by Buy-to-Play</h2><p>Unlike free mobile games, buy-to-play otome games often do not charge players any fees after paying the amount of the game itself. The phenomenon of script reading stalls caused by level-up and level-stuck in mobile games is uncommon in buy-to-play games. Players can reasonably arrange their time and read the plot content they like in one go. Many players often mind the reading stall caused by the bundling of plot and level in mobile games. On the way to wait for the upgrade, players may have forgotten the plot content of the previous chapter, thus interfering with the player’s immersive experience. The smoother reading experience is also the reason why players will choose buy-to-play otome games.</p>
