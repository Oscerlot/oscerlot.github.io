<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220607/28584_1022808.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2022 can be said to be a year of great games. Among them, <em>Elden Ring</em>, produced by FromSoftware, the developer of the Souls series, at the end of February this year, made many Tarnished revel. The Souls-like gameplay that makes people love and hate it, the rich weapon combat system, the fragmented narrative, the huge Western fantasy open world, and the shocking story worldview have swept the major game review websites and is arguably the ceiling of current open-world games.</p>
<p>So, for such a 3A masterpiece with a huge worldview and complex game mechanics, what is the localization like? Why is the translation so controversial and criticized by players? This article will take you on a journey through Elden Ring from a game localization perspective, through case analysis.</p>
<h2 id="1-“The-Chinese-Translation-is-a-Bit-Strange”-Katakana-Hell"><a href="#1-“The-Chinese-Translation-is-a-Bit-Strange”-Katakana-Hell" class="headerlink" title="1. “The Chinese Translation is a Bit Strange” - Katakana Hell"></a>1. “The Chinese Translation is a Bit Strange” - Katakana Hell</h2><p>Elden Ring has the grandest story background in the history of Souls games, thanks to the amazing imagination and creative skills of George R.R. Martin, the author of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. Martin built a magical world full of human entanglements, anxiety, and turmoil for this game. However, it is precisely this <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> style story framework that has brought huge challenges to the localization of the game, especially since the developer of the game is from Japan. In Japanese translation, if you encounter words that you don’t know how to translate, Japanese will use katakana for direct transliteration. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, we often see such a shadow. Although this form of translation is correct and does save a lot of trouble, can it really give players a good experience?</p>
<h3 id="Case-1-“Limgrave”-in-the-Novice-Village-is-Actually-a-Cemetery"><a href="#Case-1-“Limgrave”-in-the-Novice-Village-is-Actually-a-Cemetery" class="headerlink" title="Case 1: “Limgrave” in the Novice Village is Actually a Cemetery"></a>Case 1: “Limgrave” in the Novice Village is Actually a Cemetery</h3><p>Limgrave is the name of the first area where you are born, that is, the novice village. Just looking at the Chinese name, it is not difficult to imagine that it is a transliteration.</p>
<p>In fact, the English version of Limgrave is called “Limgrave”, and the Japanese version is “リムグレイブ”.</p>
<p>Grave, corresponding to the Japanese グレイブ, means graveyard&#x2F;cemetery. Then the preceding Lim- is a homophone often used in Western writing to write names and place names. So what does Lim- refer to? There are two theories.</p>
<p>The first is that the boss of the Limgrave area is called “Godrick the Grafted”. His ability is to graft the limbs of others onto himself, so it can be associated that the Lim- here refers to Limb, meaning limb&#x2F;extremity. So Limgrave means limb grave, the graveyard of limbs.</p>
<p>Another theory is this. The Lim here is a katakana transliteration of the Japanese “リム”, which actually refers to Rim. And Rim means border, edge, boundary, derived from the Old English rima. Then Limgrave means Rimgrave, border graveyard. It just so happens that the name of a dungeon next to the birthplace in the game is called the “Fringefolk Hero’s Grave”.</p>
<p>Which theory do you agree with? However, no matter which theory is correct, Limgrave is not a good place, it refers to the meaning of a cemetery, but players who have just come out of the novice village can’t see this meaning at all.</p>
<h3 id="Case-2-What-Kind-of-Castle-is-Stormveil-Castle"><a href="#Case-2-What-Kind-of-Castle-is-Stormveil-Castle" class="headerlink" title="Case 2: What Kind of Castle is Stormveil Castle?"></a>Case 2: What Kind of Castle is Stormveil Castle?</h3><p>Let’s take a look at “Stormveil”, which has been criticized by players countless times.</p>
<p>I believe that many friends with good English will think of “Stonewell” or “Stonewall” when they see this name.</p>
<p>But in fact, “Stormveil” in the English text is “Stormveil”, which is surprising. Although this name is very “Ice and Fire”, the sudden transliteration is really puzzling against the backdrop of names such as “Storm’s End” and “Stormhill”.</p>
<p>The preceding Storm means storm.</p>
<p>But what about Veil? Veil means veil in English, which means to cover up. If you have to translate it, Stormveil Castle can be translated into Stormveil Castle. Huh? Isn’t it strange?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the Japanese text - “ストームヴィル城”. The katakana of the first half of the Japanese “ストーム” is Storm, but does the remaining “ヴィル” mean Veil?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Here we checked the translation and found that “ヴィル” actually means Ville, which refers to city, urban area, town, and is a French word;</p>
<p>The katakana corresponding to Veil is “ベール”, which is different from the original Japanese.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone should also understand that “Stormveil” is actually Stormville, meaning storm city.</p>
<p>The “Stormveil” here should be a direct katakana transliteration of Japanese. If you translate the English Stormveil, then the Chinese should also be Stormveil Castle, which is obviously not the case here. However, no matter which language is used as the bridge language for translation, “Stormveil” has lost the original prestige of Stormville.</p>
<h2 id="2-Is-the-Original-Text-in-the-Game-English-or-Japanese"><a href="#2-Is-the-Original-Text-in-the-Game-English-or-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="2. Is the Original Text in the Game English or Japanese?"></a>2. Is the Original Text in the Game English or Japanese?</h2><p>According to the analysis of the above cases, we can determine that the Chinese was translated from Japanese as the bridge language, so it also fell into katakana hell. But is the source language of the game English or Japanese?</p>
<p>Although the official introduction mentioned that George R.R. Martin contributed a huge background worldview setting to <em>Elden Ring</em>, Martin mainly participated in the outline of the game legend, and the story after the player starts the game is still handled by FromSoftware’s local Japanese team.</p>
<p>Then we speculate that English is just the language used by George R.R. Martin during the creation period of the game development. Due to the background of most Japanese members of the production team, the style of most of the text in the game will be closer to the habits of Japanese culture, so it is possible that Japanese is the real source language of the game. The story framework created by George R.R. Martin in English directly transliterates untranslatable words into katakana during the translation into Japanese, and then uses Japanese as the bridge language to start localization in various languages. And some of the English we see in the game is also translated from Japanese. Stormveil Castle is an example, let alone Chinese.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion-The-Choice-of-Localization-Bridge-Language"><a href="#3-Conclusion-The-Choice-of-Localization-Bridge-Language" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion: The Choice of Localization Bridge Language"></a>3. Conclusion: The Choice of Localization Bridge Language</h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em> successfully creates a magnificent open world without losing the Souls flavor at all. Its scale is amazing, and the length of the story is also admirable. The story created by George R.R. Martin is imaginative and intoxicating.</p>
<p>But in terms of localization, the worldview of <em>Elden Ring</em> conveys a Western fantasy style. If the background of the creative language is respected, and English is used as the source language instead of Japanese, which is mainly Oriental, will the quality of Chinese localization be improved?</p>
<p>From the perspective of most current game studios and publishers, English is still preferred as the bridge language for localization. The most important reason is that based on the global universality of English, using English as the bridge language can find more experienced game translators.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the developer FromSoftware, the scale of the development team is not very large. If Japanese is used as the source language of the game for localized development, it can save a lot of development time and cost. Moreover, various translation errors that also appear in previous Souls games can also be seen. It can be seen that the developer’s priority for localization quality is not so high, and it also exposes that FromSoftware has always had some localization problems.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what language is used as the bridge language, the most important thing is to accurately convey the meaning that the game itself wants to express through different languages. Before localization, you should first understand the meaning of the original text, and the translation should be understandable, and the meaning should be conveyed correctly. This is the most important thing, rather than falling into “katakana hell”.</p>
<h3 id="Easter-Egg-Why-is-Elden-Ring-Called-“Old-Man’s-Ring”-in-Chinese"><a href="#Easter-Egg-Why-is-Elden-Ring-Called-“Old-Man’s-Ring”-in-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="Easter Egg: Why is Elden Ring Called “Old Man’s Ring” in Chinese?"></a>Easter Egg: Why is Elden Ring Called “Old Man’s Ring” in Chinese?</h3><p>Elden is very similar to Elder in English, and the meaning of Elder includes “elder”. Another very famous game, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, is nicknamed Old Scroll because of its English name “The elder scrolls”, so there is a similar nickname here in Elden Ring. The meaning of the word Ring is ring or ring. The producer of the game has explained that the ring in the game name does not mean ring, but refers to a circle. Therefore, the combination of the two has the alias of “Old Man’s Ring”.</p>
