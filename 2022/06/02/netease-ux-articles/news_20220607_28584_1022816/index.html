<p>Earlier this year, <em>Wordle</em> sparked a puzzle craze on overseas social media. Those familiar with it should not be strangers to the screen-filling pictures composed of green, yellow, and gray squares. Even now, if you type “Wordle” into a search engine, a Google dynamic icon in Wordle’s classic gray, yellow, and green color scheme will appear, which shows how popular <em>Wordle</em> is. However, this sharing that looks like Morse code, and playing it is like an educational English learning word puzzle game, why did it become popular, making overseas players enjoy it and check in every day?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Wordle-How-to-play"><a href="#1-What-is-Wordle-How-to-play" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Wordle? How to play?"></a>1. What is Wordle? How to play?</h2><p>To put it bluntly, <em>Wordle</em> is a crossword puzzle game that is updated daily. The player’s only goal each day is to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The entire game interface is simple and intuitive, consisting of a 5×6 square array; the game rules are also relatively simple. After the player enters the guess, the game will mark each letter square with a color to indicate the accuracy of the current guess:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gray:</strong> Indicates that the letter is not in the answer at all.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Indicates that the letter is in the answer, but at the wrong position.</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Indicates that the letter is in the answer and at the correct position.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players continue to try based on the hints obtained from each guess, narrowing down the scope of the answer until they guess the answer correctly or use up all six attempts. After the game, players will be provided with a statistical data, showing the accuracy rate of each step, the number of consecutive days of playing, and the countdown to the next round; at the same time, the player’s game interface will be generated into a corresponding color layout of the emoji square matrix, and the player can click the “share” button to copy and share to various social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-is-Wordle-Popular"><a href="#2-Why-is-Wordle-Popular" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is Wordle Popular?"></a>2. Why is Wordle Popular?</h2><p>Many readers may be thinking after seeing the above introduction: “Isn’t this just a traditional crossword puzzle game? How did it become popular?” “These rules are also old-fashioned, isn’t the number guessing game in <em>Xuan-Yuan Sword: Scar of Sky</em> exactly the same as this <em>Wordle</em>?”</p>
<p>So, the gameplay is not new, and the core is more like education than entertainment, why is it popular? Why are players willing to participate in the game every day and actively share it on social media?</p>
<p><em>Wordle</em> actually has a “story”. The game was born out of a love story. The game’s creator, Josh Wardle, is a software engineer. His girlfriend loves to play crossword puzzles. Wardle developed this game for his girlfriend. It is said that “Wordle” is a pun combining his last name and the game theme “Word”. In 2021, Wardle accidentally sent the game to a family group chat. The game was unexpectedly popular, making Wardle feel the game’s potential for dissemination, and only then did he share the game online at the end of the year. As of January this year, the number of players challenging Wordle every day has reached 2 million.</p>
<p>If you carefully examine the core setting of <em>Wordle</em>, it is not difficult to find that it represents a classic paradigm for the success of casual games: simple rules, easy gameplay, with many attributes that promote dissemination, and can spread to all social media that people can access. Not only that, compared with almost all casual games now thinking about how to make users stay longer, how to actively or passively share socially, Wordle does the opposite, using the setting of providing the same question to all players every day + a simple, intuitive and special sharing method, explaining what “less is more” means.</p>
<p>First of all, <em>Wordle</em> only updates one question a day. In fact, word puzzles, or casual games in general, are not considered to have high replayability, and this artificially created scarcity enhances the player’s desire to challenge and their anticipation, like “hunger marketing”, making players who successfully challenge feel satisfied, and making players who fail to challenge feel concerned. If several hundred levels are set up like in ordinary casual games, players may easily feel bored due to a large amount of homogeneous content in a short period of time. However, the setting of one question per day makes the content fresh for players every day, and it only takes three to five minutes to complete a round, making it easier to form a daily check-in habit. In addition, this setting also makes the game inherently topical, making it easy to expand the game’s voice through word of mouth. Many tweets with #dailyWordleClub on Twitter also prove this point. According to Twitter’s data statistics, in January this year alone, there were 1.3 million tweets related to <em>Wordle</em> in the UK, and the amount of chat interaction increased by 16 times.</p>
<p>Secondly, all players share a puzzle every day. Doing the same question as everyone else obviously amplifies the player’s sense of accomplishment on social platforms. Many people will compare with family and friends, “I guessed it in 3 tries, you used 4 tries or didn’t guess it, I’m better than you, at least luckier than you”. This sense of accomplishment of “what others don’t have, I have, and what others have, I have better” is greater than the sense of accomplishment of simply guessing the answer, and the player’s satisfaction can last longer.</p>
<p>Then there is <em>Wordle</em>‘s sharing function, which is relatively cleverly designed: using color blocks to refer to the game results. Due to the different problem-solving processes, each player can get a completely different three-color picture for sharing. This cryptic sharing is highly recognizable, easy to arouse the curiosity of uninitiated players, and can also allow players to communicate game progress and share “answering experience” with each other while avoiding spoilers. Moreover, the shared picture can also show how many times the player used to guess the answer today. Coupled with the rule of one word per day, players will feel a trace of invisible competition in sharing, and secretly compete in terms of IQ or luck.</p>
<p>This relatively unique way of sharing has been creatively diversified by players. From sharing solutions, to different art-styles (like Pixel Art), and other creative outlets (like Drawing, or Embroidery).</p>
<h2 id="3-Can-a-Chinese-Version-of-Wordle-be-Successful"><a href="#3-Can-a-Chinese-Version-of-Wordle-be-Successful" class="headerlink" title="3. Can a Chinese Version of Wordle be Successful?"></a>3. Can a Chinese Version of Wordle be Successful?</h2><p>Later, as <em>Wordle</em> spread to the Chinese community, some people began to discuss the possibility of a Chinese version of <em>Wordle</em>. The one that stands out is <em>Handou</em>, which is in the form of “guessing idioms”. Players first guess the tone order of the four-character idiom, and then guess the first letter of the pinyin after guessing correctly. In addition, some people have proposed that strokes, Cangjie pinyin, etc. can be used as guessing targets.</p>
<p>Although a Chinese replica version has appeared, due to the significant differences between English and Chinese characters, the difficulty of <em>Handou</em> has increased invisibly. English words are only composed of 26 English letters, so the correctness of inputting letters has become the only criterion for <em>Wordle</em>. The composition of Chinese characters is particularly complex, which can be spelled out by pinyin or composed of radicals. Therefore, even if radicals are used as additional hints, the difficulty of the game is significantly increased, making some players choose to stay away.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a derivative of <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Handou</em> has become a Chinese version of it. Although there are slight differences in rules, there is no substantial innovation in game content and gameplay. This makes it difficult for Chinese users who have experienced <em>Wordle</em> to maintain continuous attention to <em>Handou</em>. In addition, there are also Sweardle, Lewdle, Nerdle, and Globle, which are derivatives of <em>Wordle</em>. The increase of these “same old thing” homogenous games makes it more difficult for <em>Handou</em> to stand out.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Wordle</em> itself, the game was a smash hit, but it is now slowly disappearing from the public eye, which seems to be the inevitable fate of casual H5 games. The reason is that the single game mode is a pain point that they cannot solve. For most players, the freshness when they first come into contact will gradually decrease over time, until they finally choose to quit. But we cannot deny the initial success of the game. <em>Wordle</em> allows players to feel the original intention of the game: shareability, pleasantness, and competitiveness. This is what players want to see, and it is also what game developers and operators should think about and insist on.</p>
