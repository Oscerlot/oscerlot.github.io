<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220616/28584_1024555.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2017, the social deduction game <em>Werewolf</em>, based on the Werewolf culture, became one of the keywords of the game industry in the first half of 2017 due to its explosive development, and was even considered a new trend in the industry. Four or five years later, under the multiple impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, when <em>Werewolf</em> is mentioned again, it no longer has the excitement and glory of the past, or rather, it has “transformed” and appeared in the public eye in a new form.</p>
<p>In 2018, a social survival game called <em>Among Us</em> was released, but it received little attention until 2020 when it became popular due to many Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. In early 2022, following the popularity of <em>Among Us</em>, a game called <em>Dread Hunger</em>, or “Werewolf at Sea” as players call it, was launched on Steam. In the first week of its release, the number of online players of the game quickly soared from less than 3,000 to 12,000. Today, the number of online players of the game is still increasing. According to SteamDB data (data at 0:00 on May 1, 2022), the game ranks in the TOP 10 of the Steam popularity list.</p>
<p>As a cooperative survival game with a not-so-novel gameplay, incorporating elements of <em>Werewolf</em> that are not well-regarded today, why can it continue to attract players’ attention months after its release?</p>
<h2 id="1-Survival-RPG-in-Werewolf-Mode"><a href="#1-Survival-RPG-in-Werewolf-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Survival RPG in Werewolf Mode"></a>1. Survival RPG in Werewolf Mode</h2><p>“We’re almost through the passage. Storms are battering the keel and the crew are whispering of blood and dark magic.” - Captain’s Log, April 1847</p>
<p><em>Dread Hunger</em> is a multiplayer cooperative survival Werewolf-like game with the theme of social deception, survival in adversity, and escape and confrontation. The game is set in the snowy Canadian Arctic Circle. What comes into view in the game is the vast snowfield and rolling snow mountains. Players will play eight crew members with different identities on a 19th-century warship assigned by the British Royal Family, sailing through the cruel Arctic. Among them, two players will be “thralls” who will hinder other players.</p>
<p>The goal of victory is also very simple. First of all, players must ensure their own survival. The “good” side needs to get the ship out of trouble, while the “thralls” need to prevent it at all costs. Like common survival games, players need to eat, keep warm, and arm themselves. In addition, the ship needs fuel to move forward, so everyone needs to collect coal, and at the same time, the ship must avoid icebergs on the route.</p>
<p>For this game, “survival” and “Werewolf” are like the keel and sails of this ocean-going ship. “Survival” is the keel of the game, which determines whether the players can continue, and “Werewolf” is the sail, which determines where the ship goes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-It-What’s-Different"><a href="#2-Why-It-What’s-Different" class="headerlink" title="2. Why It? What’s Different?"></a>2. Why It? What’s Different?</h2><p>In fact, this gameplay is not the first of its kind in <em>Dread Hunger</em>. As early as 2019, <em>Project Winter</em> had a similar design. It was also a cold winter, also with 8 players, also with 2 “traitors”, and also all about “surviving”.</p>
<h3 id="Multiple-Character-Classes"><a href="#Multiple-Character-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Character Classes"></a>Multiple Character Classes</h3><p>On the gameplay mechanism of <em>Project Winter</em>, <em>Dread Hunger</em> adopts the multi-class setting of RPG. For example, players can play the roles of captain, chef, engineer, doctor, etc. Different roles also have different weapons and abilities. And some survival construction gameplay is retained, such as going to the wild to collect resources to build various props and items.</p>
<p>This kind of construction gameplay not only provides richer playability, but also deeply penetrates the two conditions for the game’s victory: survival and reaching the destination. The setting of multiple classes creates multiple dimensions for the player’s game experience: due to the different performance of various classes, in the middle of a game, each player can exert the characteristics of their class. Even if you are tired of one of them, there are others to choose from. For players, the rich diversity in the game process creates long-term playability.</p>
<h3 id="Each-Performing-Their-Duties-Direct-Confrontation"><a href="#Each-Performing-Their-Duties-Direct-Confrontation" class="headerlink" title="Each Performing Their Duties, Direct Confrontation"></a>Each Performing Their Duties, Direct Confrontation</h3><p>In addition, compared with games like <em>Among Us</em> that listen more to speeches, <em>Dread Hunger</em> completely abandons the meeting, taking turns to speak, and voting环节 (huán jié - sessions&#x2F;segments), and emphasizes direct confrontation between different camps. Being eloquent is not a necessary skill for the “thrall” camp, and the “good guys” do not have to organize language to “explain themselves”. Except for communicating necessary information with each other, players can focus on their own work, which greatly reduces the psychological burden between casual players and makes the game rhythm more refreshing. Through this mechanism, players can cooperate with each other and move towards the goal, or they can trust each other and eliminate the traitors.</p>
<h3 id="Operation-and-Strategy"><a href="#Operation-and-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Operation and Strategy"></a>Operation and Strategy</h3><p>The game also retains the fun of identities in traditional <em>Werewolf</em> from the mechanism setting. The ship, as the base camp of everyone, often gathers on the ship after nightfall in order to hand in supplies and avoid the severe cold. This has become a natural venue. Everyone exchanges information while doing their work: who might be a traitor, and the traitors will also be mixed in, spreading rumors and secretly sabotaging.</p>
<p>The game enters the later stage, and the game also changes from a scheming <em>Werewolf</em> to a positive asymmetrical confrontation. In order to develop better, the “thralls” will leave the main group and act alone, while the surviving good players also change from mutual suspicion to huddling together to resist the threat from the thralls and the weather. In a short game of more than 20 minutes, it includes the early game strategy, the mid-term suspicion, and the late-stage positive confrontation. With the changes in the weather and the development of the thralls, the pace of the battle is accelerating step by step, keeping the players’ nerves in a state of high tension.</p>
<p>The most important thing about the game is that it completely gives the choice to the players themselves. It tells you the ultimate goal of victory, but it will not deliberately guide players on what to do and what not to do. Players can give full play to their imagination to achieve the desired effect. As long as you can achieve the goal, the developer doesn’t care what happened in the middle, which also leads to the game’s operational ceiling being very high. Therefore, whether it is at the level of strategic gaming or in operational details, there is a lot of room for learning and improvement. So it is not difficult to understand why everyone is happy to continue playing.</p>
<h2 id="3-Social-Deception-Carnival-Under-the-Pandemic"><a href="#3-Social-Deception-Carnival-Under-the-Pandemic" class="headerlink" title="3. Social Deception Carnival Under the Pandemic"></a>3. Social Deception Carnival Under the Pandemic</h2><p>Under the pandemic, in addition to satisfying the sociality between friends, the game has also released the “little devil” deep in the player’s soul.</p>
<p>For such games, the core attraction is never the rule-based competition of other games, let alone the competition of reaction and operation. The fun is often dependent on details, the player’s observation, or various subtle clues are crucial. The reasoning process is also full of drama, and the surprise and sting that erupts the moment the mystery is revealed, the pleasure brought by acting in the dark corner under the eyes of everyone, all this together creates the fun of deception and the joy of cooperation, which is what this type of game ultimately brings us. The game seems to be saying to the player: Hey, it’s safe now, why not give it a try? The most important thing is that this “dark” impulse is currently only in the game and will not have any serious impact on real life.</p>
<p>The game’s own mechanism has also created a strong sociality. This new online social “Werewolf” has broken through the restrictions of the pandemic. Players are forced to communicate, cooperate, or compete with each other, neutralizing a certain degree of isolation in the pandemic environment. There are now many games with social interaction or interpersonal relationships as the theme, but the gameplay is often single and lacks stamina. At least for now, <em>Dread Hunger</em> does not have this concern.</p>
<p>For players, deceiving each other among friends is the real entry into the game. The questioning and lies of close friends face to face create multi-layered fear and excitement. Imagine a backstab from a friend, suspicion in a treacherous environment, or being wronged. Finally, the game is over, and back in real life, everything returns to normal. You will still continue to trust him&#x2F;her. After all, you are friends, how could he&#x2F;she possibly lie to you?</p>
