</blockquote>
<p><em>Unpacking</em> is a healing, zen-like puzzle game developed by Witch Beam, released in November 2021. The main content of the game revolves around a familiar experience – moving. While creating a comfortable living space, you will gradually learn about the life of the baggage owner. The game combines elements of block puzzles and home decoration. There is no timer, no meter, or score. All you can do is pack, organize, and place items where you think they belong.</p>
<p>The game developer used “zen” to describe their game, which describes a game mode that “imposes as few restrictions as possible on the player.” This type of game mode has also appeared in other games, such as the “Zen Garden” in <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, which often presents different forms depending on the type of game, but they don’t seem to have caused much of a stir.</p>
<p>Its “free and unrestricted” feature seems to contradict the concept of mainstream games, which leads to “zen” games almost always having low interactivity and overly simple game mechanics. You can complete the entire <em>Unpacking</em> without any tutorials. All you can do in the game is place the items taken out of the box, which is very simple for a game. But such a “simple” game is loved by players and has been nominated for multiple awards. Does it rely solely on its so-called “free, unrestricted, leisurely, and never-failing” features? How do “zen” games capture the hearts of players?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Zen”-and-Aesthetic-Experience"><a href="#1-“Zen”-and-Aesthetic-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. “Zen” and Aesthetic Experience"></a>1. “Zen” and Aesthetic Experience</h2><p>Let’s trace back to the origin of “Zen”. “Zen” comes from the “Chan” of Zen Buddhism, which is familiar to Chinese people. When this word was introduced to European and American countries, the word even deviated from its original meaning in Zen Buddhism,凝聚了西方人对于神秘的东方智慧的向往与好奇，becoming a pronoun for its subjective impression of Eastern philosophy and even Far Eastern style. For example, the “Zen” mentioned in some games often just borrows the name of “Zen”, but in fact there is no “Zen” reality, only superficiality.</p>
<p>As a design culture with a strong subjective experience, the “Zen” style represents the essence of traditional Chinese culture. The philosophical basis of the “Zen” style is composed of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and incorporates the wisdom of traditional humanities and philosophy. For example, the “natural” and “free” thinking in Taoist theory, through meditation to perceive the purity and perfection that already exists in one’s heart. It requires to perceive Zen from green mountains and green water, to experience Zen joy from one’s own daily life, and to realize the transcendence of life and spiritual freedom in the flowing and impermanent life.</p>
<p>If we apply this Nirvana thought to real life, it will make people feel satisfied, happy, and excited, and add to the情趣of life. This kind of emotion is a spontaneous expression of following nature, which will make people obtain a special pleasant experience, that is, aesthetic experience, from the perceptual intuition of nature and all things in the universe, thereby greatly improving people’s life. “Zen” games can bring players a relaxing and immersive spiritual experience. In this state of “spiritual tranquility”, the audience abandons the external world and inner distractions, concentrates their thoughts, and returns to their nature. It is like an energy that ignites people’s inner feelings and potential memories, forming more emotional works, naturally presenting the inner world of the audience. Zen games attract players through their aesthetic experience that is different from other games. Next, we will talk about how to gain aesthetic experience from games.</p>
<h2 id="2-Aesthetic-Experience-in-Games"><a href="#2-Aesthetic-Experience-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Aesthetic Experience in Games"></a>2. Aesthetic Experience in Games</h2><p>The famous psychologist Maslow once said that there are five basic needs in a person’s life, and these needs are like a ladder, gradually upgrading and accompanying a person’s life. People’s aesthetic needs actually exist in people’s subconscious, but they are rarely discovered. Such aesthetic needs also exist in video games. Early video games attracted us mainly by human primal impulses. With the development of electronic technology, the experience that games bring to people has begun to “evolve” from the primal impulses of survival and plunder to more delicate and subtle empathy and nourishment mechanisms. The design of video games has gradually begun to pay attention to the aesthetic experience of games.</p>
<p>Designing game works with deep connotations and artistic value is inseparable from game mechanics. For example, traditional artworks, on the one hand, fully display the “appearance” carefully designed by the artist, that is, the sensory experience, and on the other hand, contain deeper connotations that need to be gradually explored, that is, “connotation”. For video game works, “connotation” is its internal mechanism, which is the inner, deep, and indispensable element of the game. It reflects modern people’s pursuit of aesthetics and cultural values, and affects the gameplay of the game. While emphasizing the interactivity of the game, showing the deeper aesthetic experience of the game can enable the majority of game players to have a better gaming experience.</p>
<p>Early games on Nintendo’s 8-bit and 16-bit consoles were action games, and the operability reflected in front of players through these game mechanics became the main gameplay of these games. With the continuous development of video games and the enrichment of game types, different game types have incorporated different game elements. For example, RTS games pay more attention to the gameplay that emphasizes strategy and micromanagement, while FPS games focus on mazes, tasks, and tactical coordination. Different mechanisms reflect different game experiences, but no matter what kind of game experience, their design starting point reflects human civilization and social culture, and expresses the designer’s cultural values, aesthetic tastes, etc. Therefore, the game mechanism can also be said to be an important aesthetic feature of game art.</p>
<p>The aesthetic experience is based on the aesthetic characteristics of the game and human-computer interaction, and is a dynamic process. It is a subtle exchange between the player’s various psychological elements such as perception, imagination, emotion, and understanding and the game in the process of interacting with the game world.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fc9618abd-45ae-4494-9689-fed5d26f5646.png/size/" alt="MDA Framework"></p>
<p>In 2004, American scholar LeBlanc et al. proposed the “MDA model” of video games, pointing out that in game design, it is often the internal mechanism (Mechanics) of the game that determines the dynamic interaction (Dynamics) of the game, and then conveys the core emotion (Aesthetics) of the game to the player. He believes that the “fun” of the game is actually the aesthetics of the game. Players feel the experience that the designer hopes to bring through the mechanism through the dynamic interaction part. This interaction is not only the player’s operation, but also includes visual and auditory language, including the experience that players get from the game environment, game art, and game music. We use the following table for intuitive explanation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fd6bbc770-2e76-4e8c-90e7-f1520de64e62.png/size/" alt="Video Game Aesthetic Experience and Game Design Process"></p>
<p>From this table, we can see that the aesthetic experience of the game is a dynamic process carried out in stages. Players first come into contact with the interaction layer, that is, external effects (pictures, music, special effects, etc.). The external effect is passively accepted by the player, but the operability of the game gives the player the initiative to practice, and the player obtains a sensory experience at this level. But more important is the core layer of the game, where players will gain a psychological and emotional experience. The sublimation from psychological “pleasure” to philosophical “pleasure” depends on the emotions and cultural values in the game, and relies on the player’s understanding, judgment, and comprehension of the game mechanism.</p>
<p>With the continuous development of graphics and image technology, the graphics of video games have evolved from pixel-level to today’s next-generation quality in order to continuously improve the immersion of the game. However, any art form is not deeply rooted in people’s hearts only by the sensory surface feelings, but more by its cultural connotations. To create an aesthetic experience for players is to transform complex game rules into an experience process, so that players can rise from emotional identification to the deep “understanding” of the soul.</p>
<h2 id="3-When-We-Design-Games-with-a-“Zen”-Style"><a href="#3-When-We-Design-Games-with-a-“Zen”-Style" class="headerlink" title="3. When We Design Games with a “Zen” Style"></a>3. When We Design Games with a “Zen” Style</h2><h3 id="Abandoning-Complex-Core-Mechanism-Choices"><a href="#Abandoning-Complex-Core-Mechanism-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Abandoning Complex Core Mechanism Choices"></a>Abandoning Complex Core Mechanism Choices</h3><p>Zhuangzi believed that “heaven and man were originally one, but the moral norms and典章制度(diǎn zhāng zhì dù - rules and regulations) designated in the human world make people lose their original nature, and become incompatible with nature. Only by ‘abandoning the sage and discarding wisdom’ can human nature be liberated, return to nature, enter into the ‘sitting and forgetting’ of emptiness and clarity, and then elevate to the spiritual realm of ‘all things and I are one’.”</p>
<p>As early as the 17th century, Schiller proposed the famous “game theory”, the purpose of which is simple, that is, to illustrate that “free games” have the characteristics of non-utilitarianism. Zen games abandon complex mechanisms, there are no settings such as stamina bar, ability bar, item bar, etc., starting from emotions, emphasizing their aesthetics and freedom, and bringing players into a “flow” state. The creation of Zen games often stems from this concept of purifying people’s hearts, establishing a virtual world that can be immersed in “pure emotion” interaction without any disputes. Here we can feel another new field outside of other games that pursue excitement and a sense of accomplishment - a journey of the soul. This “journey” allows our body and mind to be completely immersed in the “tranquility” and “Zen” aesthetic experience far away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>So, in addition to abandoning complexity, what exactly does it do? We have already explained that, in order to obtain what kind of aesthetic experience, in addition to the cultural connotation of the game itself, the game mechanism is very important. And the design of the core mechanism of Zen games is very different.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F4f1ccdee-a4d5-4bde-b4ac-134c6777f5f1.jpg/size/" alt="Core Mechanism Design Principle"></p>
<p>In this core design model, in the middle is the core mechanism, and outwards are the secondary mechanism, progression, story, or “hero myth”. The core mechanism is a behavior pattern in which players need to frequently use this element to interact with the game. It works with the other three layers on the player’s brain, and then conveys a specific experience to the player. We take the classic Zen game <em>Flower</em> as an example to analyze the core mechanism design of Zen games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F0166b2af-3f65-41d8-8101-eb8f70be7670.png/size/" alt="*Flower* Core Mechanism Design"></p>
<p>We can see that “flying” as the core mechanism of the game has a free and romantic color, and the behavior patterns of the secondary mechanism have an inherent interaction and connection with the natural world. Players play the role of invisible wind and use petals to revive flowers, which makes players imagine themselves as the power to awaken natural life in the game, reflecting the connotation of natural “symbiosis”. “Flying”, as the core mechanism, not only brings players a sense of freedom, but also makes players feel that they are integrated with nature, allowing players to have zero-distance contact with nature. When the player’s emotions are integrated with natural emotions, the player realizes that reviving nature is the mission of people in this game world. This is how Zen games bring players into a “flow” state - through their unique core mechanisms.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F8551572d-b56f-4a44-88b1-8539f10dba42.png/size/" alt="*Flower*"></p>
<p>Let’s look at <em>Unpacking</em>. Although its ideological connotation may not be so profound, you can still feel the role of its Zen core mechanism in the entire game. For most people, moving may be a very troublesome thing, but in the game, the developer made it a casual and decompressing game. Moving can have many connotations. It can be the pursuit of a desired goal, or it can be an escape from a past. No matter which one, they all mean that you will face a new stage in your life.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fdb83e29c-d918-408f-a9e4-2c14699ab6ec.png/size/" alt="*Unpacking* Core Mechanism Design"></p>
<p>In the design of the core mechanism, the game selectively abandons the “packing” part and only shows the “unpacking” part. “Packing” means letting go and preparing for the next stage, while “unpacking” means introspection. When we open the sealed box and take out the items, we are actually decompressing our hearts. When we examine the items and consider their placement, we are actually examining ourselves, examining the past, and planning for the future. The game gradually brings players into a “flow” state with the core mechanism of “unpacking and placing” corresponding to the psychological process of “decompression and introspection”. The player’s emotions gradually merge with the emotions of the game protagonist. While immersed in the game experience, it also allows players to internalize some emotional experiences into their own growth through introspection. Zen games bring players a fresh emotional experience through creative core mechanism design. Such a mechanism itself is full of humanism, satisfying the emotional demands of players and allowing players to always be in a state of “flow”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F65906e15-4d6c-40f3-b5b2-800f3c6ac6fc.png/size/" alt="Items to be &quot;Unpacked&quot;"></p>
<h3 id="Metaphorical-Narrative-Design-and-Emotional-Creation-in-Levels"><a href="#Metaphorical-Narrative-Design-and-Emotional-Creation-in-Levels" class="headerlink" title="Metaphorical Narrative Design and Emotional Creation in Levels"></a>Metaphorical Narrative Design and Emotional Creation in Levels</h3><p>The “Zen” style emphasizes “imagery”, which can be understood as the original concept of Chinese art aesthetics, fully integrating the dual levels of rational and perceptual understanding. Introducing the “Zen” style in the design of video games, making full use of the aesthetic symbols with “hint” functions in it, players can also get a more emotional deep aesthetic experience from it, stimulating each player’s exclusive emotions, and incorporating more deep connotations into the game.</p>
<p>In <em>Unpacking</em>, the game narrates through the design of metaphorical mechanisms. For example, the game introduces a new concept in the third stage – some items in the room cannot be moved, which forces players to negotiate their items with others and fill in the empty spaces. You will realize that the protagonist at this time is sharing a house with others, which can easily remind you of your life in a shared space when you were young. In the fourth stage, you can move the items already in the room at the beginning of the level, which represents a compromise in a romantic relationship. There are also specific placement rules that certain items must follow. These game mechanisms that are not explicitly expressed contain the “connotation” of each stage, symbolizing the protagonist’s growth stage and life trajectory. Local metaphors strengthen the overall emotional intensity of the game, making the game have deeper ideological depth and poetic connotation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F8300d4af-bd1f-491d-bcd7-f60d549c4260.png/size/" alt="Because of cohabitation, the proudest certificate has nowhere to be placed, and can only be hidden under the bed in the end."></p>
<p>If these implicit mechanisms have a strong emotional mapping and depict the character itself and the emotional interaction between the player and the character from a microscopic perspective. Then the level design brings players into a journey of emotional ups and downs from a macroscopic perspective. Players experience 7 changes in their life trajectory through 7 moves in the game, and at the same time feel the experience of each life stage in the level. The different details of the same item in each level and the different placement mechanisms perfectly imply the changes in different stages, thereby promoting the development of emotions, identifying with and resonating with the protagonist’s state of mind reflected in different details each time, and completing a journey of life.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Ffb7e65bf-f84e-444b-99ef-3f015f7c2f8c.png/size/" alt="The same item also undergoes different changes in the game with different levels."></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The experience that video games bring to players has become more diverse with the development of technology. It is no longer limited to the relatively primitive impulses such as survival or the desire for victory at the beginning. It is slowly evolving towards higher-level and more delicate emotional needs. People hope to create a spiritual pure land in the hustle and bustle of life, where they can release more emotions and liberate their minds.</p>
<p>Traditional games often attract players through wonderful plot settings or operating mechanisms full of a sense of accomplishment and excitement, bringing players emotional ups and downs. In Zen games, there is almost no specific plot and victory or defeat. The game touches players through the interactive experience created by the mechanism. The designer integrates his own life experience and values into the game mechanism, and promotes the emotional interaction between the player and the game world from a microscopic perspective. This is the aesthetic experience that Zen games bring to players.</p>
