<h2 id="Introduction-to-Disco-Elysium"><a href="#Introduction-to-Disco-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Disco Elysium"></a>Introduction to Disco Elysium</h2><p><em>Disco Elysium</em> is a role-playing game developed and published by ZA&#x2F;UM, a game studio from Estonia. It is also their first game. <em>Disco Elysium</em> won Best Role-Playing Game, Best Independent Game, Best Narrative, and Best New Independent Game Developer at TGA2019. The basic gameplay of this game is similar to the dice-rolling gameplay of DND (Dungeons &amp; Dragons), but the points required for successful judgment can be affected by skills, the Thought Cabinet system, and the plot. This game has a large amount of text and boldly abandons the combat part completely. The only bit of combat plot is also determined by plot choices. It can be said that this is a game where text is supreme.</p>
<p>Localization is a crucial part of the game’s dissemination. Especially for a role-playing game like <em>Disco Elysium</em>, which is similar to a visual novel, localization is indispensable.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Significance-and-Difficulties-of-Localization-for-Disco-Elysium"><a href="#1-The-Significance-and-Difficulties-of-Localization-for-Disco-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="1. The Significance and Difficulties of Localization for Disco Elysium"></a>1. The Significance and Difficulties of Localization for Disco Elysium</h2><p>In this game, almost all information is conveyed through text and voice. Players obtain information through text and interact with the game plot through text dialogue options. If players cannot understand the text, then this game is almost impossible to play. The original text of <em>Disco Elysium</em> is not only English, but also mixed with French, Spanish, and even Finnish dialects. Not only that, words from various fields such as astronomy, geography, politics, history, philosophy, and economics may even appear on the same page, including words created by the author. The original text is so “unfriendly” to non-native speakers that the members of the Chinese localization team “Whisper Studio” sighed “What is this?” when they first read the original text.</p>
<p>Therefore, localization is crucial to the dissemination and sales of <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Conversely, Chinese localization is indispensable for Chinese players to access <em>Disco Elysium</em>. However, it is obvious that the localization of this game is not an easy task. The localization staff is faced with not only the problems of multiple minority languages, mixed use of created words, but also the two major difficulties of a huge text volume of 1.3 million English words, a large number of obscure metaphors, and abstract sentences. The depth of its plot text can be seen from the first two scenes of the opening, and you can also see the puns and flexible combinations of self-made words in the text. It can be seen how arduous the localization work will be.</p>

<p>In an interview with the localization team “Whisper Studio”, they mentioned: “Starting from the official localization of the official version of the game in September 2019, we spent nearly 4 months completing the initial translation at the end of 2019. We spent another month localizing the updates and new texts. It is equivalent to completing the initial translation in December, and the internal test officially started in late January and early February.” As of August 28, 2020, the update announcement of <em>Disco Elysium</em> on this day mentioned that the text of the game is still being continuously revised, polished, and supplemented after its release. “According to the latest statistics, Disco Elysium has a total of about 1.3 million English words and 1.8 million Chinese characters.” At that time, it was only a year after the Chinese localization of <em>Disco Elysium</em> began. The localization team initially localized more than one million words in just 4 months, and it was the difficult-to-localize text as mentioned above. This is already a very rare thing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Communication-Between-the-Localization-Team-and-the-Developer-is-Indispensable"><a href="#2-Communication-Between-the-Localization-Team-and-the-Developer-is-Indispensable" class="headerlink" title="2. Communication Between the Localization Team and the Developer is Indispensable"></a>2. Communication Between the Localization Team and the Developer is Indispensable</h2><p>Nowadays, problems such as isolated translation and stiff transliteration in the localization of overseas games are common. There are many reasons for this, such as the game production team cannot allow localization personnel to fully understand the entire game or the scene of the text due to confidentiality and other reasons; or the game text is translated for the second time, and is not directly localized from the original text; or the game production team does not understand the market situation and finds an unprofessional and irresponsible localization team.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic game <em>The Witcher 3</em>, traveling merchants all became “female travelers”, merchants were all translated as “perfume merchants”, and the word “cat” was replaced with “cat’s eye” globally, and so on. A large number of such stiff and strange translations have added many difficulties for Chinese players to understand the game world, and are also likely to lead to misunderstandings of the plot, and also destroy the player’s immersion. It is also obvious that the localization team did not fully access the game content before translating.</p>
<p>For another example, recently, careful players have found that the localized text of multiple items in <em>Elden Ring</em> even has exaggerated, nonsensical, and deliberate use of rare words but incorrect use. For example, in the item description of the item “Death Prince’s Malignant Pustule”, the sentence “those who have concerns (from the Buddhist Heart Sutra, meaning: obstacles)” has no source at all in the Japanese version (it is suspected to be derived from the original text meaning “cannot die completely”), let alone whether the use of Buddhist terms here is in line with the atmosphere. Netizens speculate that this kind of translation is because the localization staff cannot access the entire game to understand the overall meaning, and they do not know how to localize this original text in isolation, so they deliberately mystify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220616%2F39d512c1-1e58-4f6d-95e5-92f6feb85733.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220616&#x2F;39d512c1-1e58-4f6d-95e5-92f6feb85733.png"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3. The item “Death Prince’s Malignant Pustule” in “Elden Ring”</em></p>

<p>For <em>Disco Elysium</em>, the Chinese version was not released simultaneously with the game, but after the game was released, so the localization team was able to experience the specific scene of the text in the game. R, a member of the localization team, mentioned in the interview that “most of the people in the team played the game”.</p>
<p>Moreover, the localization team can also communicate with the original author about the text content to ensure the accuracy of difficult points.</p>
<p>R said a story in the interview: “We constantly understand the details in the process of work, and even help the original author to correct mistakes”…”For example, a Chinese text says ‘I am very tired of XX’, and it feels that something is not right when connected with the context. After repeated comparisons, we proposed to ZA&#x2F;UM: ‘Is it that tried was typed as tired here?’ They checked and found that it was indeed a typo.” It can be seen that it is indispensable for the localization team to communicate with the original author about the text content.</p>
<p>Not only that, ZA&#x2F;UM also observed the effect of the initial Chinese sample in the Chinese player community. Kaur Kender and Danis H, two executive producers of ZA&#x2F;UM, participated in the “Guangzhou Nuclear Fusion” game exhibition. They observed the performance of players playing the sample at their booth. They said “players really understood our game”: players would smile where there were humorous elements, and corresponding emotions would also be conveyed where there were dramatic conflicts, which shows that the translated text can indeed express the creative intention. The game company is responsible for its own works, and also observes and researches the effect of the translated samples. Such careful localization work is worthy of praise from players. It can also be seen that they do not simply want players to be able to read the game text, but pursue that players can understand the game connotation. This should be the effect that localization should pursue. Even if they are native speakers of different languages, they can also understand the same game connotation.</p>
<p>But with such a large amount of text, the Chinese localization of <em>Disco Elysium</em> still has a long way to go. Even now, after multiple patches, there are still errors. For example, in the figure below, “broke” is incorrectly translated as “broken”, and the correct translation should be “the billboard prevented the car from falling into the canal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220616%2F0d1547d0-71f5-4525-95bb-abe1acef055b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220616&#x2F;0d1547d0-71f5-4525-95bb-abe1acef055b.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-One-key-Language-Switching-Letting-Players-“Localize-Themselves”"><a href="#3-One-key-Language-Switching-Letting-Players-“Localize-Themselves”" class="headerlink" title="3. One-key Language Switching, Letting Players “Localize Themselves”"></a>3. One-key Language Switching, Letting Players “Localize Themselves”</h2><p>What makes <em>Disco Elysium</em> different is that it has made a very practical feature in terms of localization - one-key language switching, that is, players can specify two languages and a key on the keyboard, and pressing the key can quickly switch the language of the entire game between the two on the spot.</p>
<p>For people who cannot understand English, this function is almost meaningless, but if players have a certain English foundation, combined with today’s convenient word search software, players can independently understand some sentences that they feel they have not understood. On the one hand, this is a kind of compromise, that is, a compromise to the profound and difficult-to-localize text, allowing players to combine dictionaries to independently translate and understand some difficult points; but on the other hand, this greatly facilitates players to deeply understand the original meaning of the game. It is impossible to localize English, which is very different from Chinese, without information loss. This function allows players to read the original text to make up for the inevitable information loss in the localization process. For a game that takes text reading as almost all content, this function can be said to be a perfect fit.</p>
<p><em>Disco Elysium</em> needs this system very much. This game has a lot of hints and puns. For example, the original text of the first dialogue at the beginning has a sentence “no ex-wives contains in it” (see Figure 2). “ex-wives” is a homophone of “ex-wife”. This almost explicit pun, even if it is translated into “no old love”, players may not be able to associate it with “ex-wife”. I believe that players who have a certain foundation in English have played the first week. When they return to this first dialogue during replay, they use one-key language switching to view the original text. When they see these hints and puns, they will definitely be able to understand different content from them and get a new sense of novelty as if they were seeing this game for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="4-Careful-Production-Creates-a-Successful-“Disco-Elysium”"><a href="#4-Careful-Production-Creates-a-Successful-“Disco-Elysium”" class="headerlink" title="4. Careful Production Creates a Successful “Disco Elysium”"></a>4. Careful Production Creates a Successful “Disco Elysium”</h2><p>In general, <em>Disco Elysium</em> has become the closest one to a novel in the game, but it has the flexibility that novels cannot have, flexible and complex plot dialogues that change with choices, a unique Thought Cabinet system, and a smart one-key language switching function. In addition, players can also be immersed in the shocking soundtrack and beautiful pictures with tension when playing, as if they are Harry, immersed in the scene.</p>
<p>The production company ZA&#x2F;UM once dabbled in creating music, painting, publishing poetry and novel collections, but they all fell silent. But they combined them and created this <em>Disco Elysium</em>, which found a carrier for their thoughts that had been precipitated for many years. They boldly wrote the text obscurely and difficult to understand, boldly deleted the combat elements in the “DND” game mode, but flexibly added many interesting elements to increase the fun, and smartly added a one-key language switching system that increases the possibility of players interpreting the deep meaning of the game. They have well integrated all this, so that even we who are far away on the other side of the Eurasian continent can also happily immerse ourselves in it and play Harry Du Bois to explore the world of <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>
