<p>What is gamification? Generally speaking, gamification is a method of enriching educational content and marketing or business processes through game mechanics. Gamification design is a powerful tool to enhance user engagement and transform products from function-centered design to human-centered design. For example, gamification in education can significantly improve learner engagement and knowledge retention, and help users complete tedious tasks or training. Gamification is also incorporated into some marketing strategies to attract customers and inspire loyalty.</p>
<p>In interaction design, gamification can motivate users to perform expected actions and provide a meaningful user experience. Inserting interesting features such as leaderboards and badges into existing systems will also stimulate users’ intrinsic motivation and drive user participation.</p>
<p>Gamification is not about turning the user interface into a game. Instead, it injects fun elements into applications and systems, motivating users by introducing gamification into existing systems. There are many ways to gamify a system, such as countdowns and encouraging completed tasks, etc. People like to interact with the system and satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Dynamic-Model-of-Games"><a href="#1-The-Dynamic-Model-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Dynamic Model of Games"></a>1. The Dynamic Model of Games</h2><p>In the player motivation model collated by Quantic Foundry, the pleasure brought by action, social behavior, the challenge and practice of thinking, creativity, the immersion of the virtual world, and the experience of achievement have become the main motivations of current game players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Ff1f82a54-cbba-4a77-9dac-25c560510204.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;f1f82a54-cbba-4a77-9dac-25c560510204.png"></p>

<p>The needs related to action and social interaction are based on immediacy and adrenaline surges. People who score high on these motivations are more likely to want a sense of excitement (commonly known as “thrill”), such as instant destructive behavior, social interaction with other players, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F42eed41b-b64b-48a7-8ac2-9ae297c89d13.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;42eed41b-b64b-48a7-8ac2-9ae297c89d13.png"></p>

<p>This item addresses the user’s need for progress, skill development, and overcoming challenges. Some players want to acquire more powerful skills and deeper thinking, which gives rise to this type of game that requires players to be calmer and spend a longer time playing. It seeks progressive and cumulative mechanics. <em>StarCraft</em> is a series of games that require more strategy and high cognitive load.</p>

<p>This item involves providing users with a platform that promotes exploration and creative expression. Users can try new options or combinations at any time and create unique content, and see the results of their creativity, receive instant feedback, and be rewarded for it. Users who value this point will seek a broad and expressive style of play, they are curious and always testing the boundaries of the game. A deeper sense of immersion can be created through a profound and sophisticated game style and a complete story narrative. Personalized design and providing a sufficiently open world and gameplay can also meet the user’s creative needs.</p>

<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Personalized Face Customization Interface</em></p>
<p>From the dynamic model of the game itself, we can gain insight into the three main needs of modern people in the game. By grasping such needs, we can help the user experience design of the product have a more systematic thinking and a more complete dynamic mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="2-Design-Principles-of-Gamification"><a href="#2-Design-Principles-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="2. Design Principles of Gamification"></a>2. Design Principles of Gamification</h2><p>The basic gamification elements are: points, levels, tasks, leaderboards, badges, progress bars, avatars, teammates, etc. The design principles of gamification come from the relevant mechanisms of the game itself, including five basic mechanisms and two design principles, through which the playability of the game is guaranteed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Goals:</strong> The game must have clear overall goals: Why are you here? What is the point of the mission? Therefore, when users achieve them, they will feel a sense of accomplishment when they win, which is a basic game element to enjoy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> There is no game without rules. The most effective rules are usually easy to understand and execute, requiring little or no learning from the user. From a user experience perspective, rules will determine the various touchpoints in the user’s journey.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback is the basis of every interactive system. Users want to see their progress and how they can improve. Feedback can be displayed in the form of progress bars, new levels, encouraging messages, greetings at each level, or animations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> Users have invested time and effort according to the rules of the game, so the game needs to provide some rewards! Rewards can be virtual badges, points, trophies, coins, leaderboards, stickers, avatars, or cash, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> User engagement is at the heart of any design philosophy. To inspire this engagement, designers must be aware of two types of motivation – intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from curiosity, pride, or a sense of accomplishment. Extrinsic motivation comes from tangible things we want to achieve, such as money, good grades, or praise. In mobile applications that prioritize engagement, intrinsic motivation is much stronger. The sense of pleasure that users experience after winning something is considered the ultimate intrinsic motivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Choice:</strong> When users voluntarily participate and abide by the rules to achieve their goals, the system&#x2F;product will be interesting to them. But when they are forced to do so, the fun is greatly reduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Failure:</strong> As long as users can fail without fear of punishment, the possibility of failure brings a sense of excitement, which will keep players coming back to try again. Therefore, we can find a way to inject enough risk to ensure that users stay engaged but not frustrated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the design principles of gamification, we can better analyze how games and applications design functional mechanisms and the visual specifications of interactive interfaces according to user psychology.</p>
<p>Next comes the application link. We will explore the application of gamification mechanisms in product experience through specific examples of games and Internet products.</p>
<h2 id="3-Commonly-Used-Gamification-Designs"><a href="#3-Commonly-Used-Gamification-Designs" class="headerlink" title="3. Commonly Used Gamification Designs"></a>3. Commonly Used Gamification Designs</h2><p>Starting from the different elements of the game, there are the following commonly used gamification designs:</p>
<h3 id="Badges-and-Stickers"><a href="#Badges-and-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="Badges and Stickers"></a>Badges and Stickers</h3><p>Combine badges and stickers to reward users for completing set challenges or collecting points. Small rewards can not only give users positive feedback and enhance their enthusiasm, but also give users a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fe1ede754-5028-43a2-a43f-bb356044b491.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;e1ede754-5028-43a2-a43f-bb356044b491.png"></p>
<p><em>Personalized Avatar Collection in the Game</em></p>
<p>In the design of the game <em>Onmyoji</em>, users can unlock multiple avatar frames through activity achievements, satisfying personalization while giving users a further sense of accomplishment, and can also play a function of showing identity in social interaction within the game.</p>
<p>In the gamification of products, we can also see a variety of user avatar frames, or personalized input method skins. The game elements of badges and stickers not only fundamentally satisfy users’ enthusiasm for stamp collecting, but are also an important part of showing personal identity. Taking the language learning software Duolingo as an example, reaching new levels, spending lingots, and following friends can all earn related user badges, promoting user participation in a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F1812df73-5c6e-4c2a-b840-7c75e9b21809.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;1812df73-5c6e-4c2a-b840-7c75e9b21809.png"></p>
<p><em>Duolingo App Badge Design</em></p>
<h3 id="Leaderboards"><a href="#Leaderboards" class="headerlink" title="Leaderboards"></a>Leaderboards</h3><p>It is a huge incentive for players to see their names on the leaderboard. After all, it is human nature to desire some healthy competition to win some sweet rewards. However, designers must be careful when applying this game element. Leaderboards can have a negative impact on some users: they may feel frustrated when the competition is fierce.</p>
<p>Specifically, the system prompt when failing can use “try again” to imply that players reduce their worries about punishment and provide positive psychological guidance. The ranking display is also more gentle with the text information “top n%”. At the same time, the interaction design does not overemphasize failure. The contrast in the interaction design between the winning and losing sides is small. Compared with punishment, it focuses more on highlighting the progress of individual growth levels, which can give the losing party less frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fe678e55b-5ea1-4998-9424-93212526f097.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;e678e55b-5ea1-4998-9424-93212526f097.png"></p>
<p><em>Ubiquitous Leaderboards in Games</em></p>
<p>In the efficiency tool product Forest, users can be motivated by seeing their concentration time ranking among friends. This design is also used in WeChat Sports to mobilize users’ enthusiasm. At the same time, users can also set not to display their rankings, avoiding a lot of embarrassment. From the interaction with friends, the enthusiasm of users is mobilized through social needs, and the initiative is generated from the comparison with users in the entire platform. Leaderboards are elements that can well stimulate user motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F01874ff2-52d0-4fa7-956d-10f33e537cf0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;01874ff2-52d0-4fa7-956d-10f33e537cf0.png"></p>
<p><em>Leaderboard Design in Applications</em></p>
<h3 id="Challenges"><a href="#Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Challenges"></a>Challenges</h3><p>From daily task check-ins, ranked match upgrades to various dungeon challenges, this gamification technique turns boring tasks into exciting activities. Challenges can push users out of their comfort zone and allow them to reach new heights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F94eeca65-1569-4db8-a35b-49c43eb6f04b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;94eeca65-1569-4db8-a35b-49c43eb6f04b.png"></p>
<p><em>《Revelation M》 Task Illustration</em></p>
<p>This technique is also often applied to various learning products, maintaining user retention by setting various task challenges. In the popular word memorization software, the number of words that can be memorized is used as a reward prop. Through continuous check-in as a challenge for users to obtain rewards, and check-in stamping as a random reward, it fully mobilizes users’ motivation to pursue rewards and their expectation of random surprises.</p>

<h3 id="Points"><a href="#Points" class="headerlink" title="Points"></a>Points</h3><p>Many games use a points system to measure the success of players in conquering challenges to motivate them to complete specific tasks.</p>

<p><em>Obtaining Points Through Operations in the Game</em></p>
<p>In the ballroom game of <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, the dance score of two players is calculated by averaging the scores of the two players. While motivating players to hit more full combos, it also cultivates the tacit understanding and friendship between players, and at the same time satisfies the user’s motivational needs for challenge and making friends.</p>
<p>The game mechanism of points is also often used in Internet applications, such as language learning, productivity, time management, task managers, and education. For example, Starbucks’ “Star Rewards” mechanism transforms the consumption process into a journey of “becoming a Gold Star member” - users become higher-level members by consuming and accumulating stars, giving the traditional consumption behavior more meaning of “gain”, and giving the “star collection” a romanticized experience with an integrated brand art image. Similarly, takeaway software such as Ele.me and Meituan give feedback and redeem red envelopes based on consumption volume, which also diverts users’ attention and improves user experience with gentle gamification design.</p>

<h3 id="Journey"><a href="#Journey" class="headerlink" title="Journey"></a>Journey</h3><p>This game mechanism makes people feel like real players in the adventure. In product design, designers can apply a branched approach, introducing new features as users gain experience.</p>

<p><em>New journeys unlocked according to level&#x2F;task can make players more involved in the growth of the game</em></p>
<p>In Alipay’s “Ant Forest”, sustainable environmental tasks give users a sense of mission when playing games. At the same time, the types of trees and map chapters that are continuously unlocked according to the accumulation of user experience ensure the motivation for users to continue to participate. In the experience process, there will also be a series of branch line unlocking linkages such as Ant Manor, Baba Farm, and Protected Area Patrol, which ensures the user’s turnover and retention.</p>

<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》’s Dark Tide Mode sets a limited time range and number of revives</em></p>
<p>Constraints, restrictions, and deadlines don’t sound fun, however, adding a countdown or life limit, allowing users to complete a task within a given time or with limited life energy, can increase people’s excitement and stimulate productivity. With the dynamic effects of the game interface and sound prompts, it can further promote the player’s tension and improve the level of concentration. Such constraints are also often used in promotional activities of shopping software and personalized functions of memory software.</p>

<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Gamification design not only comes from the various mechanisms of the game, but also an experience design born based on the deep logic of user psychology and experience. Based on the common ideas and principles of gamification design, we can better improve the product service experience, use game ideas to drive users’ enthusiasm and participation, and can also use this to create more new and fun functional modules.</p>
