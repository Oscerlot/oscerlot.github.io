<p>Players are often asked to play other roles in games, and these roles may be far from our real life, such as a stern “old father.” Those classic father figures on the screen seem to be questioning us: Why, even if we don’t have relevant life experience, can we still immerse ourselves in the role of the “old father” in the game?</p>
<h2 id="1-Becoming-a-“Good-Father”-in-the-Game"><a href="#1-Becoming-a-“Good-Father”-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="1. Becoming a “Good Father” in the Game?"></a>1. Becoming a “Good Father” in the Game?</h2><p>20 years ago, when I was receiving corporal punishment from my dad, I probably wouldn’t have thought that many years later, I would be playing a stern old father in a game, worrying about how to get along with my rebellious son.</p>
<p>The father-son relationship has always been a relatively unfamiliar topic to me. When I was in college, I basically maintained a one-sentence-per-month, three-words-per-sentence relationship with my dad. The impact of this kind of father-son relationship on me is that since I started playing games, I have been strongly skeptical about whether I can empathize with the “father” role in the game. After all, for most gamers, a generally accepted truth is:</p>
<p>Empathy often comes from each person’s differentiated life experience. We are more likely to resonate with plots that are similar to our experiences, and it is difficult to empathize with characters with different personalities.</p>
<p>However, this view gradually became less convincing as some players came into contact with more and more games with fathers as the protagonists. In fact, whether it is Kratos in the new <em>God of War</em> or Joel in <em>The Last of Us</em>, I can feel the strong sense of immersion brought to me by the game characters - I hope Atreus will not follow the same path as “me” and become a revenge machine; I also don’t want Ellie to be taken away for research and become the dawn of sacrificing herself to save mankind. These emotional fluctuations seem to imply to me: You have become a “good father” in the game, whether I really have a child or am a homebody gamer who never leaves home.</p>

<p>In the DLC “A Father’s Promise” of <em>This War of Mine</em>, the father “Adam” played by the player did his best but failed to save his daughter, bringing sadness and tears to countless players. Even if none of us players may have experienced war, and few players really have a lovely daughter, these do not affect the player’s empathy and immersion with “Adam”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fd5d68921-822a-40ed-bac3-fa6e816ed78d.png/size/" alt="This War of Mine"><br><em>Steam comments from players of the DLC “A Father’s Promise” of This War of Mine</em></p>
<p>I believe that players’ immersion in the “father” role is not grandstanding on social platforms or game comments. So we can’t help but wonder, what is the magic of these video games with “fathers” as the protagonists, that can make some players who have no relevant life experience become a qualified “good father”? This article will interpret this issue from three aspects: character image, gameplay, and narrative.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-Projection-of-the-Ideal-Father"><a href="#2-A-Projection-of-the-Ideal-Father" class="headerlink" title="2. A Projection of the Ideal Father?"></a>2. A Projection of the Ideal Father?</h2><p>The first aspect of creating a strong sense of immersion is to create a character setting that meets the player’s psychological expectations. The game character controlled by the player is the main medium for the player to interact with the game. In the virtual world, they are the player’s avatar and spokesperson. The first success of many games is that the father image in the game perfectly matches the player’s imagination, or projection, of the ideal father image.</p>
<p>Projection is a concept in psychology, which roughly means that individuals will subconsciously reflect their own thoughts, emotions, feelings, and cognition on others or external things. In games, the protagonist often becomes the object of our projection. We will project our understanding of the role and behavior of this character in life onto the identity and behavior of the character in the game. Images that conform to the projection are more likely to make players empathize and understand, while images that do not conform to the projection will blur the identity of the character and even create a sense of incongruity.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we can better understand why fathers in games tend to be taciturn, tall and majestic, fatherly love is like a mountain, because this represents the image of the ideal father in the hearts of most players - not that they want to have such a father, but that they think fathers should be like this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are far more than just old father images of fathers in reality, but if there is such a game where players need to play a meticulous, powerless old dad, I believe the sense of immersion will not be very good. In many cases, we don’t even need to go that far. As long as there are some atypical fathers, it is enough to make us question the character image in the game. For example, Ethan in <em>Resident Evil: Village</em>, apart from his love for his daughter, Ethan does not show much of the side of being an old father, so that many times I would think, even if Ethan is replaced by Mia (Ethan’s wife), the feeling the game brings to me does not seem to change much, especially in recent years when there are more and more female protagonists. If the father in the game is not “typical” enough, then this “neutral” parental image does not necessarily need to be undertaken by the father. You can replace him with any family member, it can be a mother, or a brother or sister.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F0cbcc05c-a701-4a67-ade4-05c25f2f9e48.png/size/" alt="Plague Tale: Innocence"><br><em>In Plague Tale: Innocence, the older sister is the representative of the family image</em></p>
<h2 id="3-Gameplay-that-Better-Matches-the-Behavior-of-the-Father-Character"><a href="#3-Gameplay-that-Better-Matches-the-Behavior-of-the-Father-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Gameplay that Better Matches the Behavior of the Father Character"></a>3. Gameplay that Better Matches the Behavior of the Father Character</h2><p>The behavior of a character is largely reflected in the specific gameplay of the game, and players often have their own expectations for the behavior of a character. If the gameplay does not match the character image and personality, it will be difficult for players to immerse themselves in the game image.</p>
<p>The reason why switching the gender of the protagonist in <em>Resident Evil</em> is relatively less incongruous for some players is largely because they are already used to operating female characters to struggle for survival in zombies. There are enough female protagonists in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. But if the player is asked to play a feminized Kratos, Kratos, no, “Krat-Mom” stretches out her arms and tears the monster in half like tearing a chicken, I believe the sense of incongruity has already exploded. This sense of incongruity may not be brought about by the image. Even if we design Krat-Mom into the classic mother image, gentle and amiable, understanding, tearing monsters by hand will still make us instantly detach from the role. The source of this sense of incongruity is actually that the game did not achieve such a content very well, that is: the matching of character image and gameplay.</p>
<p>Let’s make another assumption. If Krat-Mom doesn’t fight by tearing chickens by hand, but takes out a staff and releases cool magic, it seems much more reasonable.</p>
<p>If the new <em>God of War</em> was all about puzzles and no longer had combat elements, it wouldn’t matter whether Kratos was a Krat-Mom - puzzle, leisure and other gameplay generally do not have a particularly obvious character tendency. These neutral gameplays generally do not encounter the problem of matching gameplay and characters, but some gameplays will have relatively strong character implications: such as bloody action gameplay, parenting, war, military simulation, and so on.</p>
<p>From a macro perspective, games with fathers as the protagonists are more suitable for action, FPS and other combat-oriented gameplays. These gameplays that focus on strength will be more in line with our expectations of character behavior. Conversely, gameplay focused on parenting and leisure is often not found in games that emphasize the father-son or father-daughter relationship. Because many times, sweeping the floor, cooking, washing clothes and mopping the floor are often not in line with most players’ expectations of their father’s behavior. This is why we often play action games with dads, but not moms.</p>
<p>From the perspective of more detailed gameplay design, the interaction between father and son can also often increase the player’s sense of immersion as a father. For example, in <em>God of War</em>, players can call Atreus to shoot arrows, or let Atreus be a puzzle-solving tool. In these simple gameplay designs, players can also feel the unquestionable, cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside father-son relationship between Kratos and his son.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F15140c63-f372-43e3-adbf-72e6cc7bf7fe.png/size/" alt="God of War"><br><em>In the game, you can use specific keys to command Atreus to shoot arrows</em></p>
<h2 id="4-Empathy-Brought-by-Delicate-Emotional-Narrative"><a href="#4-Empathy-Brought-by-Delicate-Emotional-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="4. Empathy Brought by Delicate Emotional Narrative"></a>4. Empathy Brought by Delicate Emotional Narrative</h2><p>Good game narrative is crucial, otherwise even if the character image conforms to the player’s projection and the gameplay perfectly matches the character, what we may be playing is an enhanced version of <em>Contra</em>. To this day, some players still lack a sufficient impression of the characters in <em>Contra</em>. They don’t know who “I” am, where “I” came from, or why “I” killed so many strange enemies. What <em>Contra</em> lacks, in fact, is: empathy between the player and the character.</p>
<p>From the perspective of pure plot production, empathy is not particularly difficult. There are causes and consequences in script creation, and creators can have ample space and ink to foreshadow a character so that the character’s behavior is logical. But in games, it is often difficult for us to make players have a strong sense of empathy, because game narrative is often limited by the design and volume of the game itself (unless it is a text adventure game).</p>
<p>If some inherent logic in the plot cannot be expressed in the game through delicate narrative and effective design, the audience will be detached from the character and feel that “he is not me, because I don’t know why he does this.”</p>
<p>The first DLC “Legacy of the First Blade” of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> is actually a relatively typical negative example. The protagonist played by the player will quickly experience a series of “turbulent” plots such as meeting NPCs, marrying NPCs, having children, and then having their family destroyed and sending their children away in less than 10 hours of plot. The plot content does not match the story rhythm. Marriage and childbirth itself is a major event in a character’s life, but there is no foreshadowing, and the character does not have enough inner monologue to support a series of behavioral logic. This series of narrative problems makes players feel as if they are operating a completely unrelated character, and the DLC with the lowest score in history was born.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F816abffd-fdd8-4b25-97b9-78b35401eb7f.png/size/" alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey"><br><em>In the DLC, the character played by the player will conceive new life. This segment, which should have evoked strong empathy, has been criticized by players.</em></p>
<p>In terms of game narrative to make players empathize, <em>God of War</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em> do much better. In explaining the changes in the father-son (father-daughter) relationship, they use a slow pace to tell a not very complicated emotional entanglement, which is enough for players. Of course, this does not mean that there are no narrative problems at all. For example, from my personal experience, the source of the father-son conflict in <em>God of War</em> comes from the foreshadowing of the previous work (Kratos himself is a god, but his son does not know). Without playing the first three parts, it is actually difficult for players to understand the畸形 (jī xíng - abnormal, deformed) father-son relationship between them in the early stage. Fortunately, Kratos opens up to Atreus in the middle of the game, which also makes players understand the cause and effect of Kratos’ behavior logic.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Back to our original question: how do video games make players become “good fathers”? It requires the guidance of character image, gameplay, and narrative. Although most players agree that the player’s sense of immersion comes from each person’s differentiated life experience, this is not a false proposition, but it is also not a necessary condition for players to have a sense of immersion.</p>
<p>If the game can shape its character image that conforms to the player’s projection, build relevant gameplay that matches the character, and design a game narrative with smooth internal logic, it is not an impossible task for a player who has never been a father to become a qualified father in the game.</p>
<p>Games, as the ninth art, come from life and give back to life. Our thoughts, sights, and ideas in life are projected onto our game characters, and the plots we experience through game characters will become catalysts for us to understand the world and our families. Countless players commented under the <em>God of War</em> game that Kratos’ story reminded them of their own fathers, and I am one of them. After finishing <em>God of War</em>, I called my dad after a long time. My dad hadn’t received my call for a long time and was slightly flustered, very worried that I was sick or encountered some problems. I suddenly realized that fathers are probably the same. They may not be as powerful as Kratos, but they will definitely love you like Kratos, silently but powerfully.</p>

<p>Player comment in the God of War section of Reddit: I don’t usually post things like this, but I have to do it in the face of this game. If the game is out of 10, I would rate it 11. I have a deep understanding of this story because my mother recently passed away, leaving only me and my father whom I have never been close to. Thank you, God of War.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to dedicate this article to all the fathers in the world and wish them a happy Father’s Day. The prose poems written by fathers are still circulating, don’t let them dissipate in the wind.</p>
