<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220621/28584_1025296.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game design itself exists to realize people’s dreams. In games, people can get a highly realistic experience of flying a plane to defend their homeland, or play famous figures to interpret the joys and sorrows of different destinies. This characteristic of the game destined it to be a global product from the day it was born. Language is just an obstacle to the realization of dreams in games.</p>
<p>Today, with globalization and highly developed technology, almost all game products cannot be satisfied with the success of a single market. How to acquire more players and occupy more game markets in more countries is a question that all game manufacturers must consider.</p>
<p>This article will take <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example to explore the choices and challenges faced by Chinese games in the process of going global and localization, to help more Chinese games ride the wave in the global game market.</p>
<h2 id="1-Language-Selection-Localization-VS-Internationalization"><a href="#1-Language-Selection-Localization-VS-Internationalization" class="headerlink" title="1. Language Selection: Localization VS Internationalization"></a>1. Language Selection: Localization VS Internationalization</h2><p>Internationalization refers to the modification or porting of a product or service so that it obtains the widest acceptance in different language countries and regions around the world. In practice, English is generally used as the internationalization language, and corresponding universal symbols are used.</p>
<p>Localization refers to the modification or porting of a product or service to make it more suitable for the needs of audiences in a specific language or country. In practice, the most frequently selected languages are Spanish, German, French, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Korean, Russian, and Polish. At the same time, Indonesian, Thai, Hindi, and Vietnamese are also rapidly gaining popularity. Given the growth prospects of the game market in South Asia and the Pacific region, it is expected that these languages will become popular languages in the next few years.</p>
<p>Obviously, localization is a higher stage of development of internationalization. If a game wants to achieve greater success worldwide, localization is a must.</p>
<p>NetEase’s 24 Entertainment’s <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> shoulders the important task of promoting traditional Chinese culture. From the beginning of its launch, it chose the path of global localization, hoping to provide players around the world with the ultimate user experience. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> launched its global open beta on August 12, 2021. Initially, 11 language versions were launched simultaneously for players around the world, and then Vietnamese and Thai versions were added. At the same time, it has Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean voiceovers, covering game players in more than 200 countries and regions around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F521e00e7-d269-4d97-a7d3-b341ea97ccf3.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;521e00e7-d269-4d97-a7d3-b341ea97ccf3.jpg"></p>
<p>When choosing the localization language, the first factor considered by <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> was which countries&#x2F;regions would be most popular for a Chinese-style martial arts multiplayer competitive game. Obviously, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s unique gameplay is widely popular around the world. The weapon system that combines melee + ranged weapons, the unique grappling hook design, and the unique hero skills, coupled with the blessing of Chinese martial arts elements, make it stand out among many games of the same type.</p>
<p>Secondly, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> needs to consider how to enter the world’s mainstream game market and acquire a wider game audience. Therefore, countries and regions that rank among the top in global game revenue are taken into consideration. According to Newzoo data, the top ten countries and regions in global game revenue in 2021 are: China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Brazil. This ranking has been very stable. Therefore, similar to the localization choices of many Western companies, 24 Entertainment chose French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, as well as Japanese and Korean, as the localization languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F0d8d2d61-4890-4133-b877-59df5644d31f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;0d8d2d61-4890-4133-b877-59df5644d31f.png"></p>
<p>In addition, Traditional Chinese (used in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, China) is also worth considering, because game players in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, China have high purchasing power: Taiwan, China ranks 16th and Hong Kong, China ranks 20th in the list of countries and regions with global game revenue.</p>
<p>Third, as a computer game, the main purchase channels for <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are the official website, Steam, and Epic. As one of the world’s largest comprehensive digital distribution platforms, the five most popular languages on Steam other than English are Simplified Chinese, Russian, Spanish, German, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the more popular the language and market, the more intense the market competition. The US market is known for being difficult to penetrate; while the Japanese market is lucrative, it is not the best target market in terms of specific game graphics or types. Therefore, while focusing on mature markets, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also focuses on emerging markets with huge development potential, such as: Thailand, Vietnam, and Turkey. These markets lack games in their native language and have less competition, so it is easier to achieve success.</p>
<h2 id="2-Narrative-Brushstrokes-Sinicization-VS-Westernization"><a href="#2-Narrative-Brushstrokes-Sinicization-VS-Westernization" class="headerlink" title="2. Narrative Brushstrokes: Sinicization VS Westernization"></a>2. Narrative Brushstrokes: Sinicization VS Westernization</h2><p>As an action-adventure multiplayer competitive game, the text in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is mainly divided into two categories: one is related to the setting of the game’s worldview and character background stories, and the other is related to the setting of the game’s gameplay itself. Its overall narrative style is a typical oriental style, including a large number of Chinese elements, such as: Longmen Grottoes, Bruce Lee, nunchucks, Sunwing, koi, dragon boat racing, zongzi, etc.</p>
<p>In the choice of game narrative style, the first thing is to ensure that players correctly understand the gameplay of the game, to ensure that they can quickly get started and have an immersive experience of the oriental martial arts style. Therefore, most of the texts related to the gameplay of the game adopt a straightforward narrative style.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that the correct cultural symbols are conveyed. The spread of culture is a subtle process. The clothing, weapons, props, and event settings in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> all reveal a mysterious oriental charm.</p>
<p>For cultural symbols that are well-known and accepted worldwide, the established expressions are generally used. For example: Bruce Lee, the Longmen Grottoes. On the one hand, these mature cultural symbols can help the game attract more potential players, and on the other hand, they promote the further spread of Chinese culture among the existing players of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F7f0b357b-91ed-462e-84b8-68b53a1298d7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;7f0b357b-91ed-462e-84b8-68b53a1298d7.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F634bcdae-54df-498f-a5aa-615b31847954.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;634bcdae-54df-498f-a5aa-615b31847954.png"></p>
<p>However, for cultural symbols that are relatively less well-known and accepted, and have no fixed expression, the method of free translation is adopted, careful consideration and repeated deliberation are made, and efforts are made to express the cultural meaning behind the text while increasing the understandability and acceptability of the text.</p>
<p>For example: <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has carried out a series of development plans called “Sunwing” based on the traditional cultural symbol “Golden Crow” (金乌 - Jīn Wū). The Golden Crow is a Chinese cultural symbol with an origin concept, originating from the sun bird of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. It is a symbol of Chinese cultural heritage. In the game, the Golden Crow is also the god of Naraka: Bladepoint. The development plan of “Sunwing” shows that 24 Entertainment will systematically and continuously carry out the inheritance of Chinese culture in the name of the Golden Crow. In this regard, the Thunder Fire UX global localization team carefully considered and chose “Sunwing Relics” as the translation of “金乌纪” (Jīn Wū Jì). “Sunwing” reflects the origin of the Golden Crow as the sun bird, perfectly matching the image of the “Golden Crow” in the game, and “Relics” reveals the connotation of the “Sunwing” project to inherit traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fe2c68e8e-f781-419b-9d19-a3b69edf9e52.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;e2c68e8e-f781-419b-9d19-a3b69edf9e52.png"></p>
<p>Third, the localization narrative of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> must ensure the readability and spreadability of the game text. For the oriental style worldview and character background story settings in the game, a set of parallel and corresponding Westernized worldview and character backgrounds have been constructed separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F37687f88-9ee0-4d19-9bfe-8a7a7ab28cbf.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;37687f88-9ee0-4d19-9bfe-8a7a7ab28cbf.png"></p>
<p>The concise and straightforward narrative style of the gameplay is to ensure that players quickly understand the game and ensure the basic game needs of players; the Sinicized narrative style of Chinese cultural symbols is to reflect the unique oriental style of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, give the gameplay additional cultural meaning, and increase the stickiness of players; the Westernized narrative of the worldview and character settings is to facilitate communication among Western players and improve the spread and acceptance of the game. As a successful overseas product, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> adopts different narrative styles as needed to present foreign players with a game product that perfectly combines Eastern and Western narrative styles.</p>
<h2 id="3-Common-UI-Issues-Text-Overflow"><a href="#3-Common-UI-Issues-Text-Overflow" class="headerlink" title="3. Common UI Issues: Text Overflow"></a>3. Common UI Issues: Text Overflow</h2><p>One of the most common problems in localization practice is text overflow, that is, the target language length exceeds the length of the UI reserved text box in the game, resulting in incomplete text display or text overlap. The main reason for text overflow is that Chinese text is generally compact. When the text content is translated from Chinese to other languages, the number of characters in the target language is often much larger than that of the original text.</p>
<p>In the localization practice of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the number of characters in the full-language text and the number of characters in the Chinese text were pulled and compared. The ratio of the length of different languages relative to Chinese was obtained by using the number of characters in the target language&#x2F;corresponding Chinese characters. Some interesting phenomena were found:</p>
<p>(Note: If the ratio is less than 1, it means that the number of characters in the target language is less than the number of Chinese characters, and there is no risk of text overflow; if the ratio is greater than 1, it means that the number of characters in the target language is greater than the number of Chinese characters. The larger the value, the more serious the risk of text overflow)</p>
<ol>
<li>The risk of text overflow in Korean is the lowest, at 61%; while the risk of text overflow in Thai is the highest, at 81%, and only 19% of the Thai character length does not exceed the corresponding Chinese character length;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F95a11f9d-1ef9-4346-806f-7e21a0d332eb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;95a11f9d-1ef9-4346-806f-7e21a0d332eb.png"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Among Western languages, the character length distribution of German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian tends to be consistent, which is related to the fact that these languages belong to the Indo-European language family, and there are certain similarities in word origin and grammatical structure; among them, the risk of text overflow in German, French, and Spanish is the same, and they are all relatively high, at 79%, and the risk of text overflow in Russian is slightly lower than other languages, at 73%;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F37a713b4-6070-45a1-8bbb-f44bfc814824.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;37a713b4-6070-45a1-8bbb-f44bfc814824.png"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Among Eastern languages, the character length distribution of Korean and Japanese is relatively similar, and the distribution of Thai and Vietnamese is relatively similar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Korean and Japanese belong to different language families, their grammatical structures are similar. In simple terms, the similarities between the two: the grammatical structure is subject-object-verb, and they are both “agglutinative languages”, which express grammatical forms through changes in the final ending. In addition, honorifics are developed, and the honorifics used are completely different when facing people of different generations, ages, and social status.</p>
<p>There are also many similarities in the composition and origin of Japanese and Korean vocabulary. They are mainly divided into three categories: Sino-Korean words, native words, and loanwords. Among them, native words are the most important in sentences and can express the core meaning of sentences. Sino-Korean words account for a considerable part of Japanese and Korean, both of which were once deeply influenced by Chinese culture, so Sino-Korean words come from China. In addition, in modern Korean, some Japanese-translated Chinese characters were absorbed to express new concepts. In terms of loanwords, both Korean and Japanese use a large number of transliterated words borrowed from Western languages such as English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fe0c87815-6723-48d3-9cd2-9a7742c0e3ba.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;e0c87815-6723-48d3-9cd2-9a7742c0e3ba.png"></p>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon is that the character length distribution of Thai and Vietnamese, which also belong to Southeast Asian languages, is also very similar. Although Thai uses Thai letters, Vietnamese uses Latin letters. However, in terms of grammar, both Thai and Vietnamese are similar to Chinese, and they are both isolating languages. Verbs have no morphological changes, nouns have no grammatical gender and number forms, and there are no grammatical case changes. Adjectives do not need to maintain grammatical gender, number, and case consistency with the nouns they modify. The basic word order is the same as Chinese, which is the “subject-verb-object” structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fb61016d0-7527-4653-8bc7-08e3c06deed5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;b61016d0-7527-4653-8bc7-08e3c06deed5.png"></p>
<p>In short, the risk of text overflow in various languages generally exists. In response to this situation, the problem can be solved from the following three perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the development stage, front-end personnel can indicate the recommended character length and the maximum allowed character length of the field in the localized resource configuration file;</li>
<li>When the number of characters in the target language is 1-2 times that of Chinese, focus on the accuracy of the language and the conciseness of the language during the localization translation stage. If necessary, abbreviations or manual line breaks can be used;</li>
<li>When the number of characters in the target language is more than 2 times that of Chinese, in the localization testing stage, cooperate closely with the UI team, adjust the length, width, and height of the reserved text box or table, the size of the font, or solve the text display problem through UI design (adding scroll bars), so that the text is displayed completely and the interface layout is reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thunder Fire UX’s global localization team undertook the localization of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in 13 languages. In this process, the global localization team and the interactive experience design team cooperated closely and complemented each other, and promptly solved the display problems in the language packs of various languages, providing a template for the game to go overseas and the efficient localization process.</p>
