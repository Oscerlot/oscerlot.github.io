<p>The “drop rate” is the probability that a player will get a “pleasant surprise” in the game. With the continuous development of game categories and gameplay, the “drop rate” in the player’s mouth has also expanded from the most basic monster drops to card draws, loot boxes, and all “low probability” events. In all player feedback, “drop rate” has always been a hot topic, existing extensively in various public opinions, and game industry personnel cannot avoid responding to it.</p>
<p>Why has “drop rate” received so much attention? How should we understand the “low drop rate” that players talk about? As a game user researcher, how should we dig out the “real problem” behind this feedback?</p>
<h2 id="1-Know-Yourself-and-Your-Enemy-Why-Do-Games-Set-a-“Drop-Rate”"><a href="#1-Know-Yourself-and-Your-Enemy-Why-Do-Games-Set-a-“Drop-Rate”" class="headerlink" title="1. Know Yourself and Your Enemy: Why Do Games Set a “Drop Rate”?"></a>1. Know Yourself and Your Enemy: Why Do Games Set a “Drop Rate”?</h2><p>Compared with the “functionality” emphasized by commonly used apps, games, as a form of entertainment design, pay more attention to the player’s “flow experience.”</p>
<p>The game experience pursues a process that makes players “excited and happy”. When a low-probability event like a “low drop rate” occurs, the pleasure feedback generated by the player will be greater. If doing something can get a reward, it will drive people to repeat it to get the reward multiple times. In games, this reward feedback is more immediate and obvious. Remember when you first came into contact with <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>, how many players wandered around in the wild just for a mutated monster, a precious bubble.</p>

Put Yourself in Their Shoes: How to Understand the “Low Drop Rate” Players Talk About?"></a>2. Put Yourself in Their Shoes: How to Understand the “Low Drop Rate” Players Talk About?</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous article “What Does it Mean When Players Say a Game is ‘Grindy’?”, the “grind” mentioned by players does not necessarily equal the actual time spent in the game, but rather “I feel” that it takes a long time. The same is true for “low drop rate,” which does not necessarily reflect that the game’s numerical settings are really unreasonable, but may just be “I feel” that the drop rate is low.</p>
<p>We can break down the problem behind this as follows:</p>
<h3 id="What-Exactly-is-the-“Drop-Rate”-that-Players-are-Talking-About"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-the-“Drop-Rate”-that-Players-are-Talking-About" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is the “Drop Rate” that Players are Talking About?"></a>What Exactly is the “Drop Rate” that Players are Talking About?</h3><p>“Low drop rate” is not just a “mathematical problem,” but also a game experience problem. And it will produce different situations when it corresponds to different games and different gameplay. To analyze this problem, we need to identify the context in which players mention “drop rate.”</p>
<p>For example, after a card game is launched, it often receives feedback of “low drop rate” in the early stage. Our first reaction might be: to confirm the drop rate… to think about whether the drop rate is very low…</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fa3f780c2-fdc7-49e9-8299-ae0ca89ff9c3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;a3f780c2-fdc7-49e9-8299-ae0ca89ff9c3.png"></p>
<p>Wait a minute!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into the “number trap” so quickly. Think about it first, is the “drop rate” that the player said consistent with what you understand now? “Low drop rate” does not necessarily mean “the value set by the game is low,” but the gap between the player’s psychological expectations and the current situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F907774b9-df26-43d6-8550-ddbcd6579e54.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;907774b9-df26-43d6-8550-ddbcd6579e54.png"></p>
<p>On the game’s official website and card draw page, developers have disclosed the probability of high-level items appearing. At this time, it is not necessarily the “item” itself that is the problem, but that there are items and characters in this pool. The guaranteed minimum that players want is a “character”, but what they may draw is an “item”. Therefore, even if they draw a guaranteed item, some players will think that the “experience is not good”. They didn’t get what they wanted, and they may even feel unhappy because they “wasted a guaranteed opportunity”.</p>
<p>So in this scenario, the “low drop rate” that players are talking about should actually be interpreted as “low probability of dropping characters”. Knowing the player’s needs makes it easier for us to take the next step. In subsequent updates, the product also improves the player’s experience in drawing cards through more detailed card pools, designated guaranteed directions, and exchange of specific cards after a certain number of draws. These are specific adjustments made based on specific issues.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Do-Players-Think-the-“Drop-Rate”-is-Low"><a href="#Why-Do-Players-Think-the-“Drop-Rate”-is-Low" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Players Think the “Drop Rate” is Low?"></a>Why Do Players Think the “Drop Rate” is Low?</h3><p>So why do players frequently report “low drop rate” problems?</p>
<p><strong>The first common reason: “Unscientific experimental attempts” and “Survivorship Bias”</strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, domestic online games are required to disclose the probability of drawing or synthesizing, but although the probability has been disclosed, “misunderstandings” still exist.</p>
<p>Example: The success probability of strengthening in a certain game is announced as 25%. Players may subconsciously think that this means “as long as I strengthen 4 times, it is a 100% probability”. This is definitely unreasonable from a statistical point of view. Probability cannot be accumulated. Each strengthening is a separate event. “25%” is an expected value, not a guaranteed result. But it is easy to be subjective in player feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, players who are particularly lucky are also more willing to show their results on public platforms, that is, “Survivorship Bias”, which makes other players who browse the posts more unbalanced: “Why are they all so lucky? Is this game targeting me?”</p>
<p>Here we also recommend a previous article “Demystifying How Random Numbers Are Generated”, which may help you more intuitively see the distribution of 10,000 people drawing 100 cards and obtaining SSRs in a purely random state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Ffab47a52-918a-4b1f-a1c5-656596998e63.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;fab47a52-918a-4b1f-a1c5-656596998e63.png"></p>
<p><strong>The second common reason: The profound impression under the influence of the “Zeigarnik Effect”</strong></p>
<p>People have a natural drive to “finish things from beginning to end”. The reason why they forget the completed work is because the motivation to complete it has been satisfied. If the work is not yet complete, this motivation makes people have a deep impression of it.</p>
<p>This mentality of keeping unfinished things deeply in memory is called the Zeigarnik Effect. The same is true in games. Players will have goals and tasks one by one. For example, after a new card pool comes out, players want to draw a new character. When they haven’t drawn it, they always feel uneasy and upset, and have an unfinished emotion. This emotion enhances the player’s memory of their card draw status (how many draws, what pity pulls), and keeps driving them until they draw the target card.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the number of players who obtain items at normal odds is larger in the overall player group, posts complaining about “low drop rates” can always outperform in terms of the number of feedbacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fecb0f19f-3576-40e8-98c6-2bbc24086391.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;ecb0f19f-3576-40e8-98c6-2bbc24086391.png"></p>
<h3 id="Not-Noticing-What-the-“Core-Problem”-Is"><a href="#Not-Noticing-What-the-“Core-Problem”-Is" class="headerlink" title="Not Noticing What the “Core Problem” Is"></a>Not Noticing What the “Core Problem” Is</h3><p>Most of the time, “drop rate” is not the core contradiction, other problems are. The game has a complex system. In this system, dropping equipment is not the whole of the game, let alone the whole of the player experience. The feedback that players ultimately express seems to be a “drop rate” problem, but it is not actually caused by the drop rate, but other content of the game that amplifies this problem.</p>
<p>In a player survey, we had this conversation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F93e02b56-203e-4798-aee1-2eb99faea2da.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;93e02b56-203e-4798-aee1-2eb99faea2da.png"></p>
<p>Here, the player thinks that the “low drop rate” is slowing down his development speed, and we should reflect on what methods we have designed to help players improve, and why these methods have not been effective. Perhaps the game provides too few channels for players to improve. In addition to direct drops, can players obtain them through trading, crafting, etc.?</p>
<p>That is to say, to solve this “drop rate” problem, we actually need to look at the development design provided by the game, whether it is rich and adapted to the player’s game habits. More output channels and the conversion between discarded equipment may all be directions for optimization.</p>
<p>There are two perspectives that can help us think about and break down the “low drop rate” problem.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking direction 1: Use “game design” to reverse engineer the drop rate problem, and trace back to the pre-drop rate link</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that the operation directly related to the drop rate is an “activity”, we need to calculate the player’s “effort” in it. The more complex and difficult the activity, the different the player’s feedback will be.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking direction 2: Use “user experience” to reverse engineer the drop rate problem, and what other factors have an impact</strong></p>
<p>The various links in the game are interconnected. When analyzing player feedback, consider whether the problem of low drop rate raised by the player at this time can be transformed into focusing on the player’s feelings in daily gameplay, and analyzing whether the current player’s combat power level&#x2F;achievement status&#x2F;game goals have reached a bottleneck or far exceed the game development progress.</p>
<p>In summary, when we encounter feedback of “low drop rate”, we might as well ask a few more “whys”. Why do players think the drop rate is low? And why do players think that the low drop rate is the most important factor affecting their gaming experience?</p>
<h2 id="3-Countermeasures-How-to-Adjust-in-the-Face-of-“Low-Drop-Rate”"><a href="#3-Countermeasures-How-to-Adjust-in-the-Face-of-“Low-Drop-Rate”" class="headerlink" title="3. Countermeasures: How to Adjust in the Face of “Low Drop Rate”?"></a>3. Countermeasures: How to Adjust in the Face of “Low Drop Rate”?</h2><h3 id="Will-Increasing-the-Drop-Rate-Solve-the-Problem"><a href="#Will-Increasing-the-Drop-Rate-Solve-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Will Increasing the Drop Rate Solve the Problem?"></a>Will Increasing the Drop Rate Solve the Problem?</h3><p>In response to the “low drop rate” problem, directly “adjusting the drop rate” is certainly not the best choice. In all user experience optimization, we must refuse the behavior of “treating the symptoms but not the root cause”. In the cases mentioned above, we have seen the different root causes that can be derived from the same feedback of “low drop rate”: “what is dropped is not what is wanted”, “there are few channels for development”, “the pre-activity is too boring&#x2F;too difficult” and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine what would happen if the drop rate were increased?</p>
<p>① Games focus on the state of flow. The reason why “dropping top-quality equipment” can make players think it is interesting and interesting is precisely because of its scarcity. If a prop with a 10% drop rate is changed to a 90% drop, what excitement will players have?</p>
<p>② What if it’s just a fine-tuning? For example, adjust the probability of 10% to 20%, which maintains the rarity and does increase the drop rate. If this is the case, it cannot eradicate the player’s perception of probability. Under a large sample, this adjustment of the drop rate may be diluted, and there will still be some players who will achieve it in a way that far exceeds the actual probability - they will still receive a lot of feedback about the low drop rate.</p>
<p>③ What about adding a guaranteed mechanism? The guaranteed mechanism is indeed the current mainstream operating model. At least players can get a reward after a certain number of times. But there is also a problem with this. What kind of guarantee is “conscientious”? When the game is directly linked to payment, this matter becomes even more difficult to please everyone.</p>

Players may raise the problem of low drop rate at different stages of the game version. We need to keep tracking and constantly analyzing: Perhaps the solution we designed in the previous time did not achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>For example, unlike the “guaranteed” method used in the card draw gameplay, the common method in cultivation games is to produce a substitute material A. Even if the player cannot obtain the equipment by directly farming, they can also obtain material A with a certain probability. After accumulating a certain amount, they can use A to make the desired props. If the player mentions “low drop rate” again under this condition, we can further analyze the effect and usage of material A: whether the drop also involves probability, which lengthens the timeline? Is the threshold too high, and players are caught in a cycle of wanting to get material A to improve their equipment, but their equipment needs to be made with material A.</p>
