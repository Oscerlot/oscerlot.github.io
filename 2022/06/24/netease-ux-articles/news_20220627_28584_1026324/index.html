</blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a love for beauty. This is no exception in games. If you want to become more beautiful in the game, in addition to face sculpting and makeup, fashion is essential.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the needs of players for aesthetics and personalized display, fashion also plays a very important role in the revenue of many games. Especially in fair competition games such as MOBA and Battle Royale, fashion and skins are an important part of the revenue. Even in MMO games that emphasize stats, many games have begun to adopt a dual-path operation model of “stats + fashion”.  In some games, fashion appearances are also rewarded as gameplay rewards, becoming another long-term goal in addition to stat rewards, providing players with motivation for daily activities. The importance of fashion to the game is self-evident.</p>
<h2 id="1-Do-Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Always-Sell-Well"><a href="#1-Do-Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Always-Sell-Well" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Beautiful Fashion Sets Always Sell Well?"></a>1. Do Beautiful Fashion Sets Always Sell Well?</h2><p>“What kind of fashion sells well?” is a question often asked at the beginning of many games.</p>
<p>When studying this issue, we often use another concept to replace this question, “What style and design of fashion do players prefer?”  Generally, we would think that players buy a fashion set because the design is beautiful and attractive to them.</p>
<p>However, do beautiful fashion sets always sell well?</p>
<p>The answer is, not necessarily. Beautiful fashion sets do sell relatively better, but it is not a perfect positive correlation.</p>
<h3 id="Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Do-Sell-Relatively-Better-But-It’s-Not-a-Perfect-Positive-Correlation"><a href="#Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Do-Sell-Relatively-Better-But-It’s-Not-a-Perfect-Positive-Correlation" class="headerlink" title="Beautiful Fashion Sets Do Sell Relatively Better, But It’s Not a Perfect Positive Correlation"></a>Beautiful Fashion Sets Do Sell Relatively Better, But It’s Not a Perfect Positive Correlation</h3><p>When evaluating a fashion set, we often introduce two indicators, one is sales, which represents the objective income brought by the fashion; the other is the approval rating, which represents the player’s subjective evaluation of the fashion’s aesthetics.</p>
<p>Approval rating &#x3D; Number of people who rated it as beautiful &#x2F; (Number of people who rated it as beautiful + Number of people who rated it as not beautiful)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F292f1baf-18af-4825-9513-59ddff9d9a72.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;292f1baf-18af-4825-9513-59ddff9d9a72.png"><br><em>Game A fashion sales and approval rating chart</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fa73af863-f1d8-4bcd-bcdf-f057e6847593.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;a73af863-f1d8-4bcd-bcdf-f057e6847593.png"><br><em>Game B fashion sales and approval rating chart</em></p>
<p>From the two figures above, we can see that, first of all, beautiful fashion sets do sell well, and this is the general trend. However, sales and approval ratings are not perfectly positively correlated.  In particular, the approval ratings of several top-selling fashion sets are not much different from the following fashion sets, but the sales are far apart. (The fashion sets in the charts have similar prices, the same sales methods, and no additional special effects, so they are not affected by these factors)</p>
<h3 id="The-“Breakthrough”-of-High-Sales-Fashion"><a href="#The-“Breakthrough”-of-High-Sales-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="The “Breakthrough” of High-Sales Fashion"></a>The “Breakthrough” of High-Sales Fashion</h3><p>To explain this data, we can start with the players who buy fashion. Through player contact, we can divide players who buy fashion into two categories: one is the fashionista who will steadily buy fashion and almost never miss any fashion sets. They use exclusion factors when making fashion purchase decisions. As long as the fashion is not particularly ugly, they will generally buy it.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be beautiful, but my wardrobe can’t be without it,” is a phrase often uttered by a fashionista friend of mine, which also explains to some extent why the sales of mid-ranked fashion are relatively close.</p>
<p>The other group of non-stable audiences do not have a strong need for “fashion collection” or “changing new clothes”. They will only buy when they really like it or really need it.  Therefore, if there is a significant change in sales, the reason is mainly that it has hit that large group of non-stable audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fd8192344-d0b7-43a0-abf6-ca08f816b89e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;d8192344-d0b7-43a0-abf6-ca08f816b89e.png"></p>
<p>So, what kind of fashion can cause a ripple among this group of non-stable audiences? After carefully studying the players’ discussions on fashion, we found some answers.</p>
<h2 id="2-Those-Fashion-Sets-that-“Broke-Through”-Over-the-Years"><a href="#2-Those-Fashion-Sets-that-“Broke-Through”-Over-the-Years" class="headerlink" title="2. Those Fashion Sets that “Broke Through” Over the Years"></a>2. Those Fashion Sets that “Broke Through” Over the Years</h2><p>For these breakout fashion sets, we can divide them into two categories according to the way they broke out. One is the breakout brought by self-propagation, and the other is the audience of the fashion itself.</p>
<h3 id="Breakout-Brought-by-Self-Propagation-Mainly-Social-Factors"><a href="#Breakout-Brought-by-Self-Propagation-Mainly-Social-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Breakout Brought by Self-Propagation - Mainly Social Factors"></a>Breakout Brought by Self-Propagation - Mainly Social Factors</h3><p>When studying breakout fashion, we found that some breakout fashion sets are accompanied by a very high level of discussion in the game.  Generally, after a new fashion set is released, the number of related keywords in the game will increase briefly, and players will express some opinions on the new fashion.  However, most of the time, the discussion heat of different fashion sets is relatively close, while the discussion heat of some breakout fashion sets can reach 2-3 times that of ordinary fashion.</p>
<p>For example, the following fashion set. In addition to more people participating in the discussion of new fashion, we also saw comments in the game such as: “Male characters, please consciously put on new fashion, don’t make me kneel down and beg you”, “Are there any handsome guys wearing new fashion, give me a location, let me see the abs”.  The first male fashion set with exposed abs in an ancient style game became a carnival for female players in the game.  Many male players who are not usually interested in fashion will also “reluctantly” put on new clothes for this social currency, making this fashion set an annual breakout fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F12d8f513-dd32-4682-bd49-c6b2ea355ef3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;12d8f513-dd32-4682-bd49-c6b2ea355ef3.png"><br><em>Annual Breakout Fashion Set</em></p>
<p>There are also some series of fashion sets, which are also very suitable for group building scenes among female friends and guilds in the game.  In the game, players don’t like to wear the same clothes, but wearing clothes of different colors and standing in a row has a very strong visual effect.  “Family, let’s wear swimsuits and take a group photo together”, “We are the seven swimsuit fairies” are comments that players often mention when discussing these fashion sets.  In order to wear sister outfits with their female friends, to show the relationship of the small group; to participate in the group photo of guild members; or even a shout out on the public screen for a photo, can become the purchase motivation of this group of non-stable fashion audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F6f67dcb9-cfcd-4594-81ac-238f07b14a32.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;6f67dcb9-cfcd-4594-81ac-238f07b14a32.png"><br><em>Seven Swimsuit Fairies</em></p>
<p>In addition, Qixi Festival and Valentine’s Day are also excellent times for buy-one-get-one-free self-propagation and “bundled” sales.</p>
<h3 id="The-Audience-of-the-Fashion-Itself-Fashion-with-a-High-Class-Temperament-is-Easier-to-Attract-More-Players"><a href="#The-Audience-of-the-Fashion-Itself-Fashion-with-a-High-Class-Temperament-is-Easier-to-Attract-More-Players" class="headerlink" title="The Audience of the Fashion Itself - Fashion with a High-Class Temperament is Easier to Attract More Players"></a>The Audience of the Fashion Itself - Fashion with a High-Class Temperament is Easier to Attract More Players</h3><p>In addition to the above-mentioned fashion with social attributes, we also found that fashion sets described by players as “immortal”, “luxurious”, and “noble” often have significantly higher sales.  We speculate that this phenomenon is mainly affected by the following two reasons.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to like the fashion temperament + “Value” &gt; “Price”</p>
<p>① Fashion temperament that everyone can hardly dislike.  When players evaluate fashion, they evaluate the temperament presented by the character after putting on the fashion, rather than the style of the fashion itself. For example, “cute”, “sexy”, “lady-like”, “elegant”. Each temperament will have its own audience, and it is relatively stable, and rejection is also obvious. For example, some people just don’t like to dress cutely and cutely, and prefer a tough and capable temperament. The audience size of this temperament also determines the sales of fashion sets corresponding to this type of temperament.  In a survey of fashion temperament preferences in a certain game, we also found that most of the temperaments correspond to an audience of no more than 30%, that is, to each his own; temperaments such as toughness and competence are relatively niche preferences among female players, so the sales of fashion sets with such temperaments will also be relatively low; while temperaments such as cuteness, immortality, and nobility have a relatively prominent audience among female players, exceeding 40%, so it is not surprising that the sales of fashion sets with such temperaments are high.</p>
<p>② “Value” &gt; “Price”.  When players make fashion purchase decisions, price is inevitably a necessary consideration. When prices are similar, whether it is “worth it” becomes the main criterion. Under the influence of various ancient costume dramas and Xianxia dramas in China, we subconsciously feel that clothes with the temperament of “immortal” and “noble and luxurious” are worn by people of higher status, and the clothes worn by these people of high status are all exquisitely tailored and made of exquisite materials, and the prices are not cheap. Therefore, when a cute fashion set and a noble and gorgeous fashion set are placed in front of the player, the player will naturally feel that the noble and gorgeous clothes are more expensive. When the “value” increases, “value” &gt; “price”, it is easier to make a purchase decision.</p>
<p>(But it is worth noting that the results of fashion temperament here all come from MMO games with oriental themes.  Games with different themes and art styles, and players from different cultural circles will have great differences. For example, in the Japanese server, the niche “dark” temperament in China has become the favorite of Japanese server players.  Temperament is a relatively good dimension for fashion preference research. The results in the text cannot be generalized and are only used as examples)</p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In general, in addition to the aesthetics of the fashion itself (the approval rating of the fashion is also relatively high), the self-propagation brought by social attributes and the character temperament perceived by the player after putting on the fashion (rather than the style of the fashion itself) are all powerful drivers behind these breakout fashion sets.</p>
<p>In multiplayer online games, fashion is not just an appearance. For players, fashion is sometimes a symbol of the relationship between female friends, sometimes a prop for group building among friends, and sometimes an expectation and sustenance for an image that cannot be realized in reality. In the study of fashion, starting from the player side and analyzing and understanding the player’s fashion needs and purchase motivations can also bring us many interesting answers.</p>
