<p>Recently, Sony released the final version of the PlayStation popular game related terminology list - “Game Dictionary”. This list contains more than 100 words and phrases frequently used in the game world, including game types, various gameplay terms, and slang among players. The “QTE” to be introduced next is also among them. It is a gameplay system with rich forms that can be well applied in various games, and it can even be said to be ubiquitous. When you see this term, what game scene comes to your mind first?</p>
<h2 id="1-Introduction-to-QTE"><a href="#1-Introduction-to-QTE" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction to QTE"></a>1. Introduction to QTE</h2><p>QTE, namely Quick-time event. Sony’s game dictionary explains it as a game scene in which players need to respond to multiple screen prompts and enter the correct buttons to trigger specific screen actions.</p>
<p>Players can obtain buffs, advance the game process, or avoid damage by completing QTEs. After decades of development, QTE has become an indispensable gameplay in many games and is widely known.</p>
<p>The history of QTE dates back to video games in the 1980s. Due to technical limitations, some early interactive movie games - such as <em>Dragon’s Lair</em> - pre-recorded established storylines in the form of animation or live-action movies, and then required players to perform specific operations at a fixed time period to facilitate the continued playback of subsequent game content. If the player does not follow the instructions, it will lead to the end of the game or a BAD END. This is one of the sources of QTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F184e3c03-c957-427e-b925-b9167786476f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;184e3c03-c957-427e-b925-b9167786476f.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Dragon’s Lair》 prompts the player to press the left button to enter the next animation</em></p>

<p>But the true QTE in the modern sense comes from the milestone masterpiece <em>Shenmue</em> on the Sega Saturn console in 1999. At that time, the game producer Yu Suzuki first proposed the concept of Quick Timer Events. Compared with previous works, <em>Shenmue</em> integrated QTEs into cutscenes and various aspects of the game. There are many chase and fight real-time rendered CGs in the game. During this period, players need to press the correct buttons within a certain period of time according to the prompts on the screen to avoid obstacles or block enemy attacks. If the player presses the wrong button or presses it too slowly, the player may bump into pedestrians or get punched in the face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F95fe147a-ab59-4ee5-8681-9bf5e9b6da02.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;95fe147a-ab59-4ee5-8681-9bf5e9b6da02.gif"></p>

<p>Since then, QTE operations have begun to be widely used in games, especially action games and interactive movie games. The increasingly rich forms of expression of QTE and its more diverse integration with games have brought unique interactive experiences to players.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-Design-of-QTE"><a href="#2-Interaction-Design-of-QTE" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction Design of QTE"></a>2. Interaction Design of QTE</h2><p>Currently, mainstream QTEs can be divided into two types. The first is a system that tests the player’s instant reaction. In the actual game process, the player must quickly respond to the buttons that appear on the game screen and press the buttons corresponding to the screen. With the development of technology, button operations have also evolved from the initial single button to combination buttons, joystick operations, and so on. The second is a specific or random symbol that moves back and forth quickly within a length. The player needs to press the corresponding button when the symbol moves to the valid area.</p>
<p>QTE relies on screen prompts, which will inevitably involve interaction design. Observing the constituent elements of QTE, the screen prompt includes two parts: “quick time” and “event”.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, the design of “event”, that is, the button, is relatively simple, mainly to make it clear for players to see and not to conflict with the game style. In mobile games, you can draw a schematic diagram of the finger and cooperate with pressing and sliding dynamic effects to prompt the player to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F90deb853-7da9-4781-a582-2460b607704f.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;90deb853-7da9-4781-a582-2460b607704f.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>QTE prompt in the mobile game 《Guardian Tales》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The design of the “quick time” part, that is, the visual representation of the reaction time left for the player, has a richer design expression. The two QTE forms mentioned above are also distinguished by the different design of the player’s response form.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Tomb Raider</em>, buttons appear on the screen to prepare the player, and at the same time, “bullet time” appears to “stretch” the emergency moment for the player to react. When the circle shrinks to the correct size, the player presses the corresponding button to complete the QTE operation. While retaining the “quick” element, it also makes obvious prompts from both the picture and the button dynamic effects, effectively utilizing the player’s reaction time, thereby reducing the player’s cognitive load and improving the player’s QTE experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F2fb81e9b-c518-414f-8042-0064a01cc1cb.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;2fb81e9b-c518-414f-8042-0064a01cc1cb.gif"></p>
<hr>

<p>The calibration operation when repairing generators in <em>Identity V</em> is a typical second type of QTE form. A completion judgment area is set on the arc-shaped track, and there is also a perfect judgment area. In the game, a sound prompt appears first, and the right finger area flashes, prompting the player to prepare to tap. Then the judgment area and the red pointer that sweeps across appear, and the player taps the screen to complete the QTE operation. With the help of the length of the track, a richer design of the QTE operation can be carried out that is closer to the game form, such as the length and number of judgment areas. In <em>Identity V</em>, different characters may have different judgment difficulties (different lengths of judgment areas), which also enriches the character mechanism to a certain extent.</p>

<h2 id="3-Use-of-QTE-in-Different-Games"><a href="#3-Use-of-QTE-in-Different-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Use of QTE in Different Games"></a>3. Use of QTE in Different Games</h2><p>Music games are a game genre that can be regarded as purely QTE-driven. Precisely because they are so closely integrated with QTE, they don’t immediately come to mind. Combining the judgment method of QTE with the rhythm of music has slowly developed into a separate game category. The difference in buttons and judgment methods has also created various game forms in music games. This natural QTE form is very easy to accept and even becomes a memory of a generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fdc3c0475-68dd-49a4-b4a6-9358522a789b.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;dc3c0475-68dd-49a4-b4a6-9358522a789b.gif"></p>

<p><em>《Audition》 This mode combines two QTE methods at the same time</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In action games, there are many ways to bring players the excitement and impact of the picture while simplifying the action. But the most direct way is to work hard on visual expressiveness. The most typical is to increase the effect of animation performance and make sufficiently rich QTE effects.</p>
<p>In the <em>God of War</em> series, QTEs are used to show cinematic plots. They convert various directions of pushing, pulling, and struggling into buttons on the controller, simulating a series of operations. This game hopes that when Kratos is fighting the big boss, players can also participate in this thrilling battle. At the same time, the picture can also retain the cinematic scenes and sense of lens. The first half is handed over to the traditional action mode, and the second half is supplemented by QTE expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F253a50f2-413c-40cc-ad37-d7a9df3958a1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;253a50f2-413c-40cc-ad37-d7a9df3958a1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《God of War》 combines QTE with character actions</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another type of game that makes extensive use of QTE gameplay is interactive movie games. As a plot-driven game genre, it is usually criticized for its lack of gameplay. On the one hand, letting players make various choices and independently decide the direction of the plot greatly deepens the player’s sense of substitution and control; on the other hand, using the tension and sense of operation of QTE, to a certain extent, makes up for the lack of gameplay with a low threshold. Compared with earlier games of the same type, today’s interactive movie games have more interesting designs for the consequences of judgment failure. Whether the QTE is successful or not sometimes determines the direction of different endings. This may be a passive result of the player or an active choice. At the same time, like action games, the position of the UI is no longer fixed in the center or on the left and right sides of the screen, but is combined with the character’s actions to minimize the impact of the inserted QTE operation on the plot immersion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F5aaed015-674b-4eea-add3-e71571557e46.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;5aaed015-674b-4eea-add3-e71571557e46.png"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>It can be seen that QTE has rich applications in various games. “Quick time” is a good way to mobilize players’ emotions. Whether it is to enhance the plot and action of the game, or as a small game form alone, it has good performance. But at the same time, it is also necessary to avoid its abuse, and to reasonably combine it with the game when using it, otherwise it will only interrupt the player’s game experience. Too much is as bad as too little.</p>
