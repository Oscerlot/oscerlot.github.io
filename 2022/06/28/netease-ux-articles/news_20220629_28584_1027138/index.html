<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220629/28584_1027138.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, we often see all kinds of complaints about “raising children” online: being too tired from working during the day and taking care of children at night, being driven to tears when tutoring children, and so on. These complaints invisibly make people feel very stressed about “raising children”.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to reality, “raising children in games” has been praised and favored by many players. In many MMORPG games, in order to promote player interaction, the game will solidify the emotional bond between players through the relationship (情缘 - qíng yuán) system. The child-rearing system is the “next stage” of the relationship system. It is built on in-depth player interaction and the emotional foundation of relationship players, bringing a lot of fun to the player’s game life.</p>
<p>Similar to reality, raising a child in the game is not a simple matter. In order to make players qualified parents, every player who wants to have a baby needs to pass an entrance exam to obtain the qualification to raise a child; during the pregnancy and raising process, players need to take care of the child every day and interact with the child; and after the child grows up , Players also need to supervise their children’s learning every day to improve various numerical dimensions.</p>
<p>We can see that in order to raise children, players not only need to log in to the game frequently, but also need to complete different tasks in order to take care of their children. However, even if it is so “hard”, players are still keen to “raise children” in the game. From “raising pets” to “raising children”, this kind of gameplay system with nurturing elements frequently appears in many games. Some players use them as a reflection of their inner emotions, and some will use them as an outlet for their own emotional expression. This article will further analyze the parenting gameplay in MMO games from the following aspects.</p>
<h2 id="1-Simulated-Nurturing"><a href="#1-Simulated-Nurturing" class="headerlink" title="1. Simulated Nurturing"></a>1. Simulated Nurturing</h2><p>With the enrichment of game play, the design of the parenting system in MMO games is very realistic, and the entire process of pregnancy and raising can bring a strong sense of immersion. In addition to the content mentioned earlier, players need to complete daily tasks to bring experience growth to their children. Different stages of children’s growth will also have different body types and appearances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F28b5dc1f-9bcd-4d50-a3ff-51cbc381e35a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;28b5dc1f-9bcd-4d50-a3ff-51cbc381e35a.png"></p>
<p>For example, in <em>Justice Online</em>, parents can arrange for their children to complete different courses every day, such as “going to Liyun Pavilion to listen to operas”, “going to the academy to study”, “raising flowers and plants”, etc. Correspondingly, after completing the courses, players can improve attributes of charm, intelligence, character, etc.. Because the child’s energy is limited every day, the number of courses completed is also limited, so parents need to choose and arrange courses according to their own ideas. This is like in reality, parents need to choose which subjects, such as language, mathematics, English, etc., to tutor their children according to their weaknesses.</p>
<p>After the child grows up, the child will not only repay the parents by helping them complete tasks, but also travel, and bring back travel photos of himself in different scenes to the parents. Maybe he met a little frog by the pond, or maybe he was chased by a dog named “Wangcai” (旺财 - wàng cái: a common name for dogs, literally “Prosperous Wealth”) by the road. Imagine that when parents see the bits and pieces of their children’s journey shared with them, they will definitely have a full sense of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fa91c97cd-0b61-4154-bd4b-84d089d42906.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;a91c97cd-0b61-4154-bd4b-84d089d42906.png"></p>

<p>In this process, players can obtain a real baby-raising experience at a lower cost, thereby obtaining the pleasure of nurturing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Projecting-Oneself"><a href="#2-Projecting-Oneself" class="headerlink" title="2. Projecting Oneself"></a>2. Projecting Oneself</h2><p>Compared with competitive gameplay that focuses more on operation and a sense of accomplishment, the parenting system in MMO games can provide players with a reflection of their own ideals and a proof of their emotional investment.</p>
<p>In reality, parents often project their expectations of their children onto their children. This is reflected in the fact that parents will expect their children to become what they want them to be through their own education methods.</p>
<p>In <em>Justice Online</em>, each baby will have exclusive personality tags (such as outgoing, introverted, naughty, etc.). Personality traits will be reflected in the daily interaction between the baby and the parents. Parents can also set personalized face customization and outfits for the baby according to their own preferences. Therefore, every baby is unique. In addition to personality, babies in the game will also have their own body types (such as burly, strong, petite, slender, etc.). In the process of “raising” children, players can raise a “baby” that meets their expectations according to their ideal settings, and can also obtain happiness and satisfaction other than upgrades.</p>
<p>Parents improve the baby’s values in various dimensions by giving gifts, chatting and other interactive forms, as well as taking classes, thereby projecting their expectations of the baby. And when the parents’ expectations are met, the parents’ sense of happiness and superiority will also be nourished.</p>

<h2 id="3-Warm-Companionship"><a href="#3-Warm-Companionship" class="headerlink" title="3. Warm Companionship"></a>3. Warm Companionship</h2><p>In games, the use of AI is very common, including the parenting system. A powerful AI system can allow babies to give playful feedback to different chat content sent by parents, allowing players to obtain psychological comfort through the company of their children in a boring life. Many players will chat with their babies when they are free and bored. If they encounter interesting conversations, they will also take screenshots and share them on social platforms. This not only provides a sense of companionship in conversations with the child you raised yourself, but also a great outlet for emotions when sharing with game friends&#x2F;real-life friends.</p>
<p>In various games, there are actually many players who are “socially phobic”. They will feel that socializing with other players is troublesome or stressful, but when facing their own baby, this pressure disappears. Through such companionship, “socially phobic” players can also have fun playing alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F1deea576-6975-4c2b-a786-24ed8c581c67.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;1deea576-6975-4c2b-a786-24ed8c581c67.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Picture: Players晒(shài - show off&#x2F;share) their conversations with their children on the Tieba (贴吧 - a Chinese online forum)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the parenting system of <em>Justice Online</em> was launched, many players would communicate with their “babies” in various ways, finding more companionship in this kind of casual and nurturing gameplay; many players also shared their daily baby-raising life on platforms such as Tieba and Dashen (大神 - a game community platform), communicating interesting stories experienced during the parenting process with friends, and recording the growth of their children. This is actually the same as parents in reality going crazy showing off their babies on WeChat Moments.</p>
<h2 id="4-Intimate-Social-Interaction"><a href="#4-Intimate-Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="4. Intimate Social Interaction"></a>4. Intimate Social Interaction</h2><p>The connection between the parenting system and the relationship system is very close. Although single players can also adopt children in the game, many players have children together after forming a relationship between the opposite sex. In the process of raising children with their game partner, players can also strengthen their intimate relationship. Because raising children can add more topics between partners and bring more companionship to each other.</p>
<p>In the game, both parents can often complete parenting tasks together, and there will be no tasks that can only be completed by the father or the mother. In this process, players need to arrange the parenting of their children according to their own daily situation, and at the same time, they also need to discuss the parenting direction of their children together. This is very important for promoting social interaction between relationship partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F3ba0b671-cdd8-4762-af11-99d34e756245.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;3ba0b671-cdd8-4762-af11-99d34e756245.png"></p>
<h2 id="5-Ordinary-Social-Interaction"><a href="#5-Ordinary-Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="5. Ordinary Social Interaction"></a>5. Ordinary Social Interaction</h2><p>In addition to intimate social interaction between relationship partners, players can also use children as a topic to establish social relationships with other parents. Social interaction has always been an extremely important element of MMORPG games, and it plays an important role in maintaining players’ relationship networks and creating game topics. As one of the derivative gameplays of MMO games, the parenting system can establish another important social field between “parents” in addition to fixed teams, guilds, PVP arenas, etc.</p>
<p>In the daily tasks of the parenting system, the game will set some tasks related to social interaction with children, such as playing with other children. In order to complete these tasks, parents also need to find friends for their children, which actually promotes social interaction between players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fc17effd7-8858-4617-b18c-81c022f5d1b2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;c17effd7-8858-4617-b18c-81c022f5d1b2.png"></p>
<p>In addition, the game will also design exclusive play scenes for children (actually also for adults), such as amusement parks. These scenes generally have interactive props, such as seesaws, merry-go-rounds, etc. Players can play with their children. In these scenes, parents can not only interact with their children, but also interact with other parents, thereby establishing social relationships.</p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The parenting system has gradually become one of the “essential systems” of MMO games. In some games, the parenting system will be tied to numerical growth, and players will also raise children in order to improve their combat power. But for most players, raising children is to be able to obtain a real baby-raising experience in the game world. I believe that the parenting system in the game will continue to be optimized in the future, bringing players a more realistic sense of nurturing.</p>
