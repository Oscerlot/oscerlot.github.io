<p>A survey in the book “How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design” pointed out that when asked “What moments in games make you want to cry?”, the vast majority of players answered that it was when facing the death of an NPC who fought alongside the player. As an object of emotional projection for players in the game, NPCs are one of the main sources of emotional experience for players in the game. The interaction between NPCs and players is particularly important in story-focused RPG games. So how do NPCs bring players a profound and three-dimensional emotional experience through interaction with players in RPG games?</p>
<h2 id="1-Credible-NPCs-Meeting-Player-Expectations"><a href="#1-Credible-NPCs-Meeting-Player-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="1. Credible NPCs - Meeting Player Expectations"></a>1. Credible NPCs - Meeting Player Expectations</h2><p>First of all, the appearance of NPCs in the game needs to meet the player’s expectations. If the behavior of the NPC and the interaction with the player are in line with the player’s expectations of the character’s inner and psychology, the NPC is credible. Such an NPC gives a lifelike feeling, even if the player knows that the facts are not so. Credibility must be consistent with the player’s expectations in order to create a high-quality, credible NPC. These expectations can be divided into three levels from the perspective of psychology: physics, biology, and psychology.</p>
<p>From a physics perspective, players expect animated and non-animated objects to follow what physicists call “naive physics”, which involves our everyday understanding of how the physical world works. For example, the movement of NPCs has a trajectory and does not appear out of thin air; NPCs are affected by factors such as weight and inertia, and will collide with each other rather than penetrate each other, and so on. These most basic rules that conform to the operation of objects in the physical world need to meet the original expectations of players. The magical creatures that resemble jellyfish in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em> line up in the air to form a path that helps players move forward; the NPC Robin in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, although walking around the library at will, will immediately turn around when the player touches her. These all conform to the basic rules of the physical world.</p>

<p>From a biological point of view, the real creatures that appear in the game world bring us a lot of “original” expectations. When players interact with other creatures, whether they are new creatures created in the game or portrayals of real creatures, our “original” expectations will evaluate these creatures. Psychologists call the results of these expectations “naive biology”. In the production of game NPC creatures, it should conform to people’s most basic expectations of the biological system. For example, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the interaction with pets, the feedback behaviors generated by players in the process of interacting with pets are based on the reactions of real creatures after being stroked and patted.</p>

<p>Psychological expectations are called “theory of mind”, which refers to the “naive theory” that everyone has to understand each other. However, it is very difficult to make all artificial characters in the game pass the Turing test. In order to meet the players’ naive expectations for artificial characters, game social interaction can respond accordingly. Starting from <em>GTA</em>, the game has a corresponding feedback design for NPCs to players. For example, when players enter a new scene, enter someone’s field of vision, or do something that attracts their attention, players can get corresponding feedback, such as the attention, greetings, complaints, and abuse of passers-by NPCs. In this way, the player’s game experience in this scene will be more vivid and interesting.</p>

<p>The NPC behavior in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is even richer. When a player walks into a room, the NPCs in the space will lock their eyes on the player, and even actively interact and talk with the player. The reactions of NPCs of different characters will also be different, such as the attention of guests, people standing waving to the player, greetings from the bar waiter, etc. These all realistically simulate the scene where people suddenly break into a space in life and attract the attention of passers-by, so the player’s emotional experience will be better.</p>

They have different personalities, introverted or extroverted, stubborn or open, stingy or friendly. Personalized and distinctive NPC shaping can bring players a vivid game experience and make the game world come alive.</p>
<p>Cassandra in the mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> will say in a slightly contemptuous and mocking tone: “You’re dressed just right for you—ordinary enough”, making players want to change into new clothes. Cassandra’s spicy and arrogant princess-like character makes people instantly think of the difficult classmates they would meet in school.</p>

<p>Or Xia Yan in the mobile game <em>Revelation</em>. Players will get Xia Yan’s help when they first enter the game. As an NPC, Xia Yan witnessed the player’s growth in the game. She always looks at you with a smile and tells you what the next step of the task is in the gentlest tone, like a caring older sister of the player in the world of Revelation. Players always think of good things happening when they see her, and there is a sense of intimacy. NPCs like this with unique personalities can bring players a more three-dimensional game experience, as if they are in a parallel world, and NPCs are the people we can also meet in this world.</p>

<h3 id="The-Depth-of-“Evil”"><a href="#The-Depth-of-“Evil”" class="headerlink" title="The Depth of “Evil”"></a>The Depth of “Evil”</h3><p>In RPG games that pay more attention to the story, the emotional interaction between villain NPCs and players is often more deeply rooted in people’s hearts. The “evil” of villains often stems from the tragic stories behind the NPCs, allowing players to understand their “evil” and create emotional connections with the NPCs. Arthas in <em>Warcraft</em>, the human prince with a superior background, pulled out the cursed sword under the lure of the dreadlord Mal’Ganis in order to defend his homeland. Under the impact of strong revenge, he gradually moved towards darkness and became a death knight who believed in darkness. Finally, he was killed under the attack of several coalition forces. Arthas is a tragic villain in ancient Greece and one of the most classic villain NPCs.</p>

<h3 id="Connection-with-the-Player’s-Subconscious"><a href="#Connection-with-the-Player’s-Subconscious" class="headerlink" title="Connection with the Player’s Subconscious"></a>Connection with the Player’s Subconscious</h3><p>What kind of characters do players want to punish in the game? The materialized monsters in the player’s subconscious, the most typical are the zombie NPCs in shooting games. They are villain NPCs that disrupt world peace and disrupt players’ task plans. In terms of appearance, they are monsters that look like humans, so in the player’s subconscious, killing zombies will have the same sense of accomplishment as “killing” real players, but at the same time, there is no guilt like “killing” real players. The Wujian Abyss mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is a typical case. In this mode, players become heroes who fall into the Wujian Abyss, and they “kill” the zombies in the chaotic abyss, bringing players a lot of pleasure.</p>

Fighting side-by-side with players is the most direct way to generate emotional experience with players. For example, Pu Songling in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em> serves as the player’s “guide” throughout the novice guidance process of the game, playing a great role in helping players quickly participate in the game and promoting the development of the story.</p>

Even if it does not directly interact with the player, the self-interaction of NPCs with the scene can create a more vivid game environment for the player, so that the player will not feel bored and lonely even in a single-player game. In <em>The Sims</em>, after the player chooses to interact with an NPC, the NPC will form its own actions according to the scene. For example, sit down on a nearby chair or lie down on the bed.</p>

In the game, an NPC with a mission is more dynamic and real than an NPC that simply guides players to complete tasks.</p>

NPC Behavior - Strengthening Emotional Experience"></a>4. NPC Behavior - Strengthening Emotional Experience</h2><h3 id="Protection"><a href="#Protection" class="headerlink" title="Protection"></a>Protection</h3><p>“Sense of responsibility” is an emotional experience that other traditional media cannot bring to the audience except for games. When the choice is given to the player, a sense of responsibility arises. Because the game background and game mechanics are easy to create a sense of heroism, the protective relationship is a relationship between the player’s avatar and the NPC that often appears in the game.</p>
<p>A very famous example is the game <em>ICO</em>, which uses a simple mechanism of holding the girl’s hand by pressing R1 to play the game. The girl can help the player cooperate to open doors and so on in some aspects. The girl is also very fragile, so much so that the player is very worried about losing her. Holding her hand means that the player is with the girl, and no matter what the situation, the player can protect the girl from harm. Through the extremely simple mechanism of “holding hands”, all the emotions and warmth in the game are created. This kind of emotion and healing do not need words and plot pictures to express. Through the interaction between the player and the NPC, the player forms a profound emotional experience.</p>

<h3 id="Cooperation"><a href="#Cooperation" class="headerlink" title="Cooperation"></a>Cooperation</h3><p>In recent years, games in which players and NPCs are dominated by cooperative relationships are also increasing. This cooperative interaction can usually be promoted through the game plot, thereby strengthening the player’s emotional experience. <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> tells the story of two brothers who embark on an adventure to save their seriously ill father. Both brothers are controlled by one player. They cross obstacles, meet allies, save people and save themselves along the way. The NPC giant in the game is very powerful and looks fierce, much like the big BOSS in the game. But the giant always wears a crying expression when he appears, because the giant has lost his wife and expects the protagonist brothers to help him rescue his wife. To this end, the giant and the two brothers reach a cooperation. The giant provides a lot of help to the player during the adventure, such as using his arms to build a bridge for the protagonist brothers, and the two brothers played by the player help the giant rescue his wife.</p>

<h3 id="Competition"><a href="#Competition" class="headerlink" title="Competition"></a>Competition</h3><p>As a special NPC in the game, the enemy and the competitive relationship formed by interacting with the player can also trigger the player’s emotional experience after being designed. In <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em>, through the promotion of plot tasks, the game helps players deeply understand the events that happened in the village and the love story told in the game background, allowing players to accept challenges and defeat one NPC after another. In this process, players not only have a high sense of participation, but also cultivate a stronger role for themselves and obtain rich equipment, thus bringing players a high emotional experience.</p>

<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>The term NPC reveals that they mostly appear in narrative games. As the objects of players’ emotional projection, they are the key to narrative games to tell good stories and improve players’ emotional experience. For example, in RPG games, the relationship between NPCs and players is presented through dialogue or narration, and the word “relationship” is often the key word for emotional experience related to NPCs. Through the three perspectives of biology, physics, and psychology, credible and high-quality NPC characters that meet players’ expectations can be established; at the same time, shaping the complete personality and background of NPCs can allow NPCs to interact with players and scenes in the game and witness the growth process of players; finally, taking the behavior of NPCs as the outlet for players to strengthen their emotional experience, establishing relationships such as “protection”, “cooperation”, and “competition” in the process of tasks, creating diverse and profound emotional experiences for players in the game.</p>
