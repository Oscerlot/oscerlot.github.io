<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220704/28584_1028724.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 30, 2022, the French government officially announced a major reform of the expression and use of video game terminology, stipulating the prohibition of English game terminology and requiring state public officials to take the lead in using pure French game terminology in their work to protect the purity of the French language.</p>
<p>The French Ministry of Culture stated that, given that the French e-sports field has been occupied by English, causing “understanding barriers” for non-gamers in France, banning English game terms will help facilitate the daily communication of the French people. In fact, French people or those who understand the development of French language and culture may already be indifferent, because the French official circles have taken many similar actions in the name of “French purity” in recent years, but the results have always been minimal. Behind such policies, it is not entirely the will of the French government, and the participation of the famous Académie française and the “Immortals” is indispensable.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Immortals-and-Generation-Z"><a href="#1-The-Immortals-and-Generation-Z" class="headerlink" title="1. The Immortals and Generation Z"></a>1. The Immortals and Generation Z</h2><p>Government intervention in the use of language is not an uncommon event: since the birth of French, France has used the power of the state and government to intervene in the use of standard language for hundreds of years. The Académie française is the oldest and most prestigious academic authority in France, composed of 40 academicians, who are appointed for life and are called “Immortals”. The main task of the Académie française is to standardize the French language and protect various arts. The “Immortals” work to maintain the clarity and purity of French in development and change. They not only compile dictionaries, but also achieve this goal by making suggestions and participating in various committees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(The people in formal dress in the picture are academicians of the Académie française, i.e. “Immortals”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1975, France passed the “Act on Maintaining the Purity of French”, stipulating that the use of explicitly prohibited English words would be fined. In 1994, the “Law on the Use of French” was passed, prohibiting the use of foreign languages in public advertisements and radio and television programs (except for foreign language programs), and violators would be heavily fined. At the same time, the law also stipulates that all new French words must be explained and approved by the Académie française and published in the official gazette before they can be used.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the power of English has conquered cities and territories in countries around the world along with the development trend of the macro economy, and France, as a cultural power, has not been spared: in February 2022, the Académie française stated that French is undergoing “degeneration”. The reason is that the use of English words has become a habit among young people of Generation Z in France. This generation is deeply influenced by the Internet, instant messaging, mobile phones, computers and other technological products, and the community relations and values brought about by technological development have deeply affected their self-identity.</p>
<p>While American technology and entertainment companies are leading the global trend, they have also subtly introduced the core pronouns of their respective fields into the languages of different countries. This kind of invasion first made the French directly copy English, such as “hashtag”, “cloud computing”, “big data” and other words, which are already commonly used words in the daily expression of the French people. Then, the French were forced to graft flowers and trees, and speak English in a French way, such as “bugger &#x2F; buguer”, is the reader familiar? Add a French suffix to the English word “bug” and English becomes French. Finally, there is another type of English word, which belongs to “blossoming inside the wall and fragrant outside the wall”. For the “Customiser” used by many French network platforms, everyone must be familiar with it - a variant of the English word “Customize”, but in fact, many French people themselves may not be clear that this English word originated from the Old French word “Custume”.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Does-the-French-Government-Go-to-Great-Lengths"><a href="#2-Why-Does-the-French-Government-Go-to-Great-Lengths" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Does the French Government Go to Great Lengths?"></a>2. Why Does the French Government Go to Great Lengths?</h2><p>Behind all relevant news is a huge industrial chain - the cultural and creative industries have long become one of the important pillar industries of the French national economy, and the French government has played a vital role in the development of the digital publishing industry and the e-sports industry. Taking the direct income of the French cultural and creative industry in 2013 as an example, compared horizontally with other major production areas in France, the turnover of the cultural and creative industry has exceeded that of the automobile industry (60.4 billion euros) and the luxury goods industry (52.5 billion euros), approaching the communications industry (66.2 billion euros) and the chemical industry (68.7 billion euros). In other words, the cultural and creative industries play an important role in enhancing France’s international competitiveness and influence. The results of the “France Macroeconomic Imbalance Report” of the European Commission released in 2014 showed that video games have the most amazing high growth rate (72%) among all French cultural industries. From a consumption perspective, the cultural consumption habits of the French have undergone tremendous changes: the average daily time spent on the Internet, watching TV, listening to music, playing games, going to theaters, reading newspapers and other cultural and entertainment activities is about 9 hours.</p>
<p>In 2021, the total sales of the French video game market reached 5.6 billion euros, an increase of 1.6% compared with 2020. SELL, the French organization that provides the market annual report, that is, Le Syndicat des Éditeurs de Logiciels de Loisirs (created in 1995 and composed of giant companies specializing in publishing in the field of video games), pointed out that the number of French video games has increased by 13.5% in the past two years, and 2020 was also a record year for the French market.</p>
<p>In 2021, the combined sales of PC and console games were 24 million units, and the sales of accessories for these two platforms increased by 11%, reaching 480 million euros. During these years, the French market was still dominated by digital sales, and 82% of software sales were digital sales through PCs, consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>From the data in 2021, PC game sales showed an upward trend, increasing by 5% year-on-year, reaching 1.4 billion euros, while console and mobile games increased by 1% and decreased by 1% respectively, and the development momentum remained relatively stable. In 2021, the console accounted for 49% of the total French market, with sales of 2.7 billion euros, the highest level since 2008. In the same year, more than 2.37 million consoles were sold in the entire French market, and the potential of the French console game market cannot be ignored. Among them, whether it is the console game market or the PC game market, action games occupy a dominant position in the French market.</p>
<p>Today, the French video game market has moved from niche to mainstream. The French government promulgated the “Loi pour une République numérique” (Digital Republic Law) in 2016, officially recognizing the independent status of e-sports and its practitioners, and constantly planning relevant regulations to ensure the rapid and steady development of the French e-sports industry. After Paris successfully won the right to host the 2024 Olympic Games, the French Olympic Organizing Committee stated that it was considering including e-sports in the Olympic Games.</p>
<h2 id="3-French-Localization-from-AAA-Games"><a href="#3-French-Localization-from-AAA-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. French Localization from AAA Games"></a>3. French Localization from AAA Games</h2><p>It is better to say that the French government is mending the fence after the sheep are lost, than meddling in other’s affairs – a sense of crisis is driving the government, so it has to maintain its market in the form of decrees. The source of this crisis is English. In the trend of economic globalization, English is no longer an ordinary language, but a convention, a carrier, and a component of market value. French has been affected at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="Passive-and-Active"><a href="#Passive-and-Active" class="headerlink" title="Passive and Active"></a>Passive and Active</h3><p>In video games, the word “matching” frequently used in most multiplayer games does not have a perfect substitute in French, and can only be borrowed from English “Matchmaking” (as shown below) - not because of the lack of ability of localization staff, even the games under Ubisoft (a long-established French game company) use this method.</p>
<p>So, how to deal with proper nouns that have accurate French alternatives? As shown in the figure below, “FRIEND PASS” refers to a pass function. If one of your friends has purchased the game, the other party can invite you to play the game for an unlimited time. “FRIEND PASS” is literally translated as “friend pass”, and accurate alternative expressions can be found in French, but the Ubisoft localization team still uses a purely English expression. In fact, it is not difficult for us to speculate that in terms of this commercially related term, the localization team chose to tap the market value first. Here, as an important component of promoting market value, English has stronger universality than French, that is, this localization processing method can facilitate players’ understanding to the greatest extent, thereby promoting consumer behavior.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Ouroboros-Paradox"><a href="#Ouroboros-Paradox" class="headerlink" title="Ouroboros Paradox"></a>Ouroboros Paradox</h3><p>The French localization of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is also affected by the entanglement between English and French. For example, for the description of a hero’s skill in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>
<p>Chinese: “迦南的绝学” (Jia Nan’s ultimate skill)</p>
<p>English: “Matari’s unique ultimate”</p>
<p>French: “Ultime unique de Matari”</p>
<p>Without understanding French grammar and composition, it is easy for everyone to see that French actually achieves a “perfect” correspondence with English in form, but the word order is different. In fact, French players have feedback that “(French word unique) would make people think that Canaan has only one unique skill.” (The hero actually has three optional skills). That is, excessive reference to English text, or excessive procedural mechanical correspondence, ignoring the specific effect of French localization transplantation, will cause certain confusion to players.</p>
<p>So, where is the root of such problems? We still have to trace back to the language evolution of French and English. The English word unique comes from the French unique, and the French word comes from the Latin unicus. This situation is very common between the two languages. Now, a confusing thing has happened: for market and procedural considerations, French localization must refer to English content, but English is derived from French and other European languages at the source. Among them, small differences will inevitably have a huge impact. Therefore, French localization needs to be more cautious, starting from the player experience at all levels, obtaining real feedback from French players in a timely manner, and constantly testing the actual effect of localization.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>According to the French government, “streamer” should be changed to “joueur-animateur en direct”; “E-sports” should be changed to “jeu vidéo de compétition” - we don’t need to fully understand these languages to clearly see that this is advocating that the French people make their lives more “complicated”. The expansion of English influence and radiation in the world is not news, but its specific effect on the development trend of specific languages is worthy of our in-depth analysis. The changes brought about by this cultural interaction not only herald difficulties, but also symbolize breakthroughs - whether French can be rejuvenated and re-lead the direction of cultural output while actively and passively integrating with English is still worthy of our attention. Only by grasping the latest trends and changes can the results of localization attract players to the greatest extent and develop the potential of the local market.</p>
