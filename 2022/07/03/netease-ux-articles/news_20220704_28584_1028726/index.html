<p>Not long ago, the new <em>Call of Duty</em> series released a new promotional video. The official name is <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II 2022</em>. Casually, it can also be called <em>Call of Duty 19</em>. Some players may find this official name very awkward or very familiar, which is fine, because the first <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> was released in 2009, and then in 2020, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</em> was released. Now, a remaster is not enough, and Activision wants to completely reboot this series to reap the last wave of nostalgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2F01a56c96-0bce-40b3-af98-4f81d7fb725d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;01a56c96-0bce-40b3-af98-4f81d7fb725d.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ghost, who died as early as 2009 and died again in the 2020 remaster, will be resurrected again in 2022</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So why is it that both publishers and players love annual games so much, and never get tired of it?</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Effect-of-Brand-Value"><a href="#1-The-Effect-of-Brand-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. The Effect of Brand Value"></a>1. The Effect of Brand Value</h2><p>When a publisher releases a hit, they will definitely try to keep the IP. This is also very common in other industries. For example, <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, which was released some time ago, was able to reboot <em>Jurassic World</em> 14 years after three <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies were made. Does it have the flavor of <em>Call of Duty</em> rebooting the <em>Modern Warfare</em> series? In fact, the reason is the same. When an excellent work appears, the publisher will try to continue its value, which is why many excellent games and movies have sequels.</p>
<p>However, the quality of the sequel is also very important. It stands to reason that a AAA title like <em>Call of Duty</em> requires hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and several years of development. If it is released every year, it is basically impossible to guarantee the quality of the game. So Activision Blizzard thought of this early on and handed over this possibly most valuable game IP to three different studios for development, so that each studio can get 2-3 years of development time, and each generation can bring players a different feeling.</p>
<p>For example, IW studio’s most classic Modern Warfare trilogy, and Treyarch’s Black Ops series, which has been foreshadowed since the fifth generation of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Finally, there is Sledgehammer Games, which was in danger. The 11th generation, Advanced Warfare, was their debut. Although it was controversial to put the theme on future warfare for the first time, the UI design of the gun information in it impressed the players. After all, two of the studio’s founders were from Visceral Games. It is obvious that there are shadows of the UI in <em>Dead Space</em>. These three top studios go hand in hand to ensure the quality of the game. The games that seem to be released every year have actually been polished for 2-3 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fe88e9f05-ab41-428b-8bec-16b65aec43a1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;e88e9f05-ab41-428b-8bec-16b65aec43a1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The UI design of this generation left a deep impression</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Compared to <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s direct competitor <em>Battlefield</em>, only the support of the DICE studio makes it difficult for EA’s ace FPS to become an annual game. <em>Battlefield</em> can barely be released every 2-3 years. The shortcomings of non-annual releases are also obvious. <em>Battlefield 2042</em>‘s reputation has plummeted and cannot be remedied, and it is unknown when the next generation will be released. Although <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, which was released at the same time, is rarely mentioned after the next new game is released, and everyone’s attention is focused on the new <em>Call of Duty</em> 4 months later, even if the previous generation flops, Activision Blizzard can also say “Don’t panic, everyone, look at my new game next year, it will be better”, while EA can only remedy it through one DLC after another.</p>
<p>In summary, <em>Call of Duty</em> has become a high-value brand that allows players to form a fixed memory. Some people will buy it without thinking when they hear <em>Call of Duty</em>. This is because the brand value of <em>Call of Duty</em> is much higher than other games, and their brand value is largely due to the annual nature of the game. There are many releases, the quality is good, and the competitors really can’t keep up. How can you resist not buying it?</p>
<h2 id="2-Reduce-Game-Costs"><a href="#2-Reduce-Game-Costs" class="headerlink" title="2. Reduce Game Costs"></a>2. Reduce Game Costs</h2><p>The first is the cost of publicity and distribution. For example, when you think of FPS games, you think of <em>Call of Duty</em>, when you think of football games, you think of <em>FIFA</em>, and when you think of sports management games, you think of <em>Football Manager</em>. These are already inertial thinking. The marketing team no longer needs to spend a lot of money to let players know what our game is and what features our game has. Target players are already staring at the annual releases every year and are ready to buy. This kind of annual game that has formed a brand effect has a great advantage in publicity. Of course, there is another kind of brand effect, which is the producer effect. Hearing the names of Hidetaka Miyazaki and Hideo Kojima is actually a guarantee of quality in a sense, and publicity will also have a great advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fe223e7e7-fb4e-498f-a60e-e40dc955e8a8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;e223e7e7-fb4e-498f-a60e-e40dc955e8a8.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Football Manager》is a typical example of “old wine in new bottles”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another point is that the development cost of the game itself will be lower. For example, the <em>Football Manager</em> series is both loved and hated. The game mechanism is basically updated to 0 every year, but it needs to change the database of players every year. This database is the core content of the game. As a game industry practitioner, it is not difficult to imagine their development process: the basic game design process will not change, the basic gameplay and functions will be slightly optimized, and the data will be changed. It is very easy and pleasant. But this can’t be blamed too much on the manufacturers. If too many changes are made at once, it will be criticized by players. For example, <em>Call of Duty 15</em> directly cut out the single-player campaign, which caused many players to refuse to buy it (<em>Battlefield 2042</em> also cut out the single-player campaign, but it was not the direct reason for its poor reputation).</p>
<h2 id="3-Avoid-Development-Risks"><a href="#3-Avoid-Development-Risks" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Development Risks"></a>3. Avoid Development Risks</h2><p>Another benefit of annual games is that they can “make quick money” every year. For example, <em>Call of Duty</em> series every year is one of the most important sources of revenue for Activision Blizzard. If this series suddenly disappears one year, the development team may not be able to withstand the pressure from shareholders. Although Rockstar can spend 200 million in costs and 5 years of development time, they are also betting that <em>GTA5</em> will be a big seller in the future, and they have indeed sold more than 150 million copies.</p>
<p>But their parent company, Take-Two, is also very thoughtful. The <em>NBA 2K</em> series of its 2K studio still follows the annual series. After all, the development of <em>GTA6</em> also needs funds. The annual games allow the development team to avoid some unnecessary risks. After all, if this year’s sales are not good, new games can be released next year to continue selling. It will not cause several years of development investment to be wasted due to dismal sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2F55920a21-daaf-42a2-ac7e-30094cc5618c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;55920a21-daaf-42a2-ac7e-30094cc5618c.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Rockstar’s successful development experience is very, very difficult to replicate</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Following the previous point, Rockstar’s <em>GTA5</em> is a successful example, and <em>GTA6</em>, which has been released 9 years after the previous game, is likely to be a successful example. However, there are also many examples of infinitely increasing costs due to the long development cycle, such as the development of <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, which lasted for ten years. During this period, there were also situations such as temporary replacement of producers. The long-term development in the middle also almost “exhausted” the company.</p>
<p>The much-criticized <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also made for a long time. Finally, it couldn’t withstand the pressure to go online, cut a lot of game content, and pushed a semi-finished product full of bugs online. For example, the memorable black screen all the way out of Arasaka, I thought it was artistic processing at first, but later found that the processing time was a bit long, and finally realized that it was a bug. Faced with such a long-term R&amp;D, high-cost, and high-pressure new research project, if there is an annual game with a faster development rhythm, better sales expectations, and can also reduce game costs and risks, would you be tempted? Game companies need to make a profit. As for which of these two has greater risk and how to choose, it is naturally clear at a glance.</p>
<h2 id="4-Hidden-Worries-How-Long-Can-Annual-Games-Last"><a href="#4-Hidden-Worries-How-Long-Can-Annual-Games-Last" class="headerlink" title="4. Hidden Worries: How Long Can Annual Games Last?"></a>4. Hidden Worries: How Long Can Annual Games Last?</h2><p>Perhaps for manufacturers, steadily launching an annual game can continue to bring in a certain amount of revenue, but no one knows how long this rhythm will last, because the same game experience will not satisfy players. “Released every year, scolded every year, bought every year, played every year” has become the most pertinent evaluation of annual games by players. Blindly seeking stability will only make players feel tired. For example, the previously mentioned <em>Football Manager</em>, the gameplay system has hardly improved every year. The series is too conservative, causing the game to stagnate for several years. Even if there are no vicious bugs when the game is launched, the user experience of players has not improved.</p>
<p>Here we have to mention the competition between competitors. If you were to recommend a game to a classmate who likes the NBA and wants to try an NBA game, what would you recommend? After thinking about it, there seems to be no choice other than <em>NBA 2K</em>, and the overall quality of this game is also good, so it’s always right to recommend it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fb9989cc1-ffe2-4699-bdba-888589a03be8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;b9989cc1-ffe2-4699-bdba-888589a03be8.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The mixed reviews say it all</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But for players familiar with the <em>NBA 2K</em> series, this game is definitely not perfect, and it is difficult to satisfy old players. The mixed Steam reviews also prove this point. Basically, each series of <em>NBA 2K</em> cannot achieve mostly positive reviews. However, if we don’t buy it, there will be no similar games to play this year, which also leads to the “love-hate” emotion of players.</p>
<p>Standing still is destined to not go far. The original absolute dominator of the NBA series, the <em>NBA Live</em> series, was taken away by the more realistic and better-looking <em>NBA 2K</em>. The lack of response from the former has since slumped and quickly disappeared from the players’ vision. The same is true for EA’s other ace FPS project, the <em>Medal of Honor</em> series. <em>Call of Duty</em> has made double breakthroughs in themes and techniques since the 4th generation, creating the <em>Modern Warfare</em> series. DICE studio, which started in 2002 and was subsequently acquired by EA, also leaped into modern times from <em>Battlefield 1942</em>; while <em>Medal of Honor</em> still insisted on the World War II theme setting and walked to the end. After being forced to turn to modern warfare themes in 2010, its poor game production details made the series instantly die, and no new works have been released since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fbe848725-5182-4595-8375-e238b679b1ef.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;be848725-5182-4595-8375-e238b679b1ef.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The familiar Normandy landing scene is gone forever</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, game manufacturers have also realized this problem. In order to ensure the quality of the game, manufacturers have begun to make trade-offs in the development model: Ubisoft announced that it would slow down the launch of new works after the launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em>; at the same time, Activision Blizzard also revealed in an internal email in April this year that although the sales of <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em> were good, it was confirmed that the <em>Call of Duty</em> series would no longer be an annual game, and the game’s development model will change from “annual release” to “always on”.</p>
<p>In short, the existence of annual games has caused a lot of controversy, but manufacturers and players are trying to adapt to the new environment.</p>
