<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, when players are teleported into the battlefield, a loading page appears, with the difficulty of the current match displayed in the upper left corner, such as “evenly matched” in the image below. What kind of emotions will players have when they see this? Will they feel nervous when they see “quite challenging,” or will they relax when they see “easy to handle,” and bring this feeling into the match?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220705%2Fd5e5e1dd-cfa8-49c7-b309-8f185ef10dd1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220705&#x2F;d5e5e1dd-cfa8-49c7-b309-8f185ef10dd1.png"></p>

<p>If this reaction occurs, it can be explained by the phenomenon of “priming.” The preconceptions we have after seeing the prediction of the difficulty of the match will strongly influence our interpretation and memory of this game. In the priming phenomenon, people’s prior judgments will strongly influence the way they perceive and interpret information. For example, seeing a “quite challenging” opponent, recalling the experience of being eliminated immediately after landing, and then avoiding high-resource areas where players gather, and choosing a route to farm.</p>
<p>The simple words on the loading page can make players perceive their positioning in this game. “Priming” is a concept in social psychology, which belongs to the category of social thinking. This article will explain the application of social thinking in game experience design.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-are-Social-Psychology-and-Social-Thinking"><a href="#1-What-are-Social-Psychology-and-Social-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="1. What are Social Psychology and Social Thinking?"></a>1. What are Social Psychology and Social Thinking?</h2><p>Social psychology studies how people view each other, how they influence each other, and how they relate to each other. Its core questions are: How do we construct the world? How do social intuitions guide or mislead us? How is social behavior affected by ourselves, others, and biological factors?</p>
<p>This discipline is divided into three directions: social thinking, social influence, and social relations. Among them, social influence analyzes the shaping of behavior by society and personality tendencies. Social relations mainly study biological behavior, individuals’ feelings and actions towards others. The social thinking that this article focuses on includes how to perceive oneself and others, beliefs and judgments, attitudes and behaviors, etc. The research topic is how we construct social reality and how social intuition affects us.</p>

Why Can Social Thinking Support Game Design?</h2><p>The Internet is increasingly reconstructing human “gaming” behavior and even daily interactions, such as WeChat steps and Ant Forest. In the game, especially in games with strong social attributes, the real space and the virtual space blend with each other. People communicate through the social systems built into the game platform or through communication tools and software. They not only contact each other in the game, but also participate in offline activities and rituals, making individuals, games, and society penetrate and embed each other through the integration of reality and the network.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s season updates, interactive concerts, and the latest addition of KAWS exhibitions and other cross-border activities are all attempts to integrate games with reality. All players can participate in the carnival, jump into the space-time rift together, watch rocket launches and robots fighting monsters, dance and play mini-games at concerts… <em>Fortnite</em> is good at grasping the emotions of players. These activities have strong social attributes. Although they cannot directly communicate like in reality, players will have a tacit understanding. Everyone’s identity seems to have changed in an instant. Everyone who fights on the battlefield will become gentle and friendly when participating in activities, as if they have become friends. The reason for this phenomenon is that in a specific environment, players’ cognitive identity of themselves and others has changed. Social thinking can help us understand the essence of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Many social subgroups, or “interest-based groups,” have formed around games. They are becoming increasingly organized, and then constructing a certain “subculture” with the ability to influence social life. More and more games are beginning to break the circle, holding offline exhibitions, and even, like <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>, building their own theme parks. The social form in the game and the real world are complementary. Therefore, the rational use of theories related to social thinking can guide our game design.</p>

How to Combine Social Thinking with Design</h2><h3 id="Self-and-Others"><a href="#Self-and-Others" class="headerlink" title="Self and Others"></a>Self and Others</h3><p>Social thinking can help us better understand ourselves and answer the ultimate question of “who am I.” The constituent elements of self-concept are called “self-schemas,” which is the understanding of oneself, such as strong, smart, etc., which strongly affects our processing of social information. The accurate positioning of oneself needs to be completed through “social comparison,” that is, comparing with others and thinking about why oneself is different.</p>
<p>In the game, we can help players understand their own positioning with the help of others’ situations and construct a reasonable self-schema. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has designed a leaderboard for each hero, accurate to the province and city. For achievement-oriented players, this is a very effective tool. By observing the leaderboard situation of each hero, they can establish game goals and plan their career in the game, such as using relatively easy heroes to rush to the top of the leaderboard, or thinking about how to maintain their ranking on the leaderboard. Perhaps, players will imagine what level they will reach and what position they will get on the leaderboard. This is the concept of “possible selves.”</p>

<h3 id="Beliefs-and-Judgments"><a href="#Beliefs-and-Judgments" class="headerlink" title="Beliefs and Judgments"></a>Beliefs and Judgments</h3><p>The priming effect at the beginning of the article is one of the ways we perceive the social world. There are some more interesting research conclusions about the priming effect. Our processing of many pieces of information is automatic and subconscious. Due to the existence of embodied cognition (there is a strong connection between physiological experience and psychological state), even physical feelings will initiate our social judgments. Therefore, changing to a set of peripherals that you like can theoretically improve the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Our perception of the world comes from experience and memory, as does the game world. The game will tell a complete story. Even if the game has already done foreshadowing, players will sometimes still be dissatisfied with the plot content, thinking that it is not self-consistent. They will point out problems or describe the story they think is reasonable for everyone to discuss. This phenomenon is called “belief perseverance.” People are attached to the beliefs they held before (the ideological consciousness formed by the fusion of real life and the game worldview, which is expressed here as the view on the plot), and it is difficult to change their views when they are denied.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the player’s gaming experience, multi-ending games, or adding selectable plot directions in the game, are common solutions that can satisfy players’ different views. <em>Deathloop</em> constructs a peculiar world. When players first wake up on the beach, they will continue to receive a lot of novel settings. With the progress of the game, each player will form a unique belief about this virtual world in their minds. In the final choice, no matter whether the player shoots or commits suicide, their judgment can get the most consistent ending with expectations. Judgment and belief are closely connected. Decisions and explanations based on impressions are called “heuristic judgments,” and the choices made in the game are like this.</p>

<h3 id="Attitudes-and-Behaviors"><a href="#Attitudes-and-Behaviors" class="headerlink" title="Attitudes and Behaviors"></a>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3><p>People’s attitudes and behaviors often differ. The final answer reached by social psychologists is: our attitudes and behaviors are each affected by many factors, but under certain conditions, our thoughts and feelings will be closely related to our actions. In the theory of planned behavior, a better indicator of predicting individual behavior is to understand the individual’s behavioral intentions and their perceived self-efficacy and sense of control.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Death Stranding</em> as an example, players will understand the worldview in the plot and clarify that they need to connect the node city and the relay station with the chiral network to save the world. This part can establish the player’s attitude towards behavior. The online buildings in the scene and the delivery information of other players in the menu can help players establish a self-schema, so as to have their own subjective standards. Various guidelines and encouragements in the game have strengthened players’ beliefs that they can achieve their goals, which belongs to the perceived control. The above attitudes, subjective standards, and sense of control are collectively expressed as the player’s behavioral intention to continue the game, arrange the itinerary, and set off immediately. This is the embodiment of attitude predicting behavior.</p>
<p>How to make players have the attitude expected by game designers depends on various systems and designs in the game. For example, through plot cutscenes, emails, and well-placed background music embedding, to tell the worldview. Leaderboards, map systems that emphasize online buildings, signs in scenes, order systems, evaluations, and achievement systems can all directly or subconsciously cultivate players’ attitudes.</p>

<p><em>In 《Death Stranding》, the relationship between game design, player attitude, and player behavior</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Conversely, behavior may also affect attitudes. The behavior prescribed by social roles casts the attitude of the role-player. In the game, will there often be NPCs asking you for help, and these requests are one after another, becoming more and more complicated? Experiments have shown that if you want someone to do you a big favor, an effective strategy is to ask them to do a small favor first. This is the “foot-in-the-door phenomenon,” which is widely used in the design of game mission systems.</p>
<p>Also in <em>Death Stranding</em>, in the game, when you complete a commission, the NPC will thank you and give you more and more complex orders (tasks). The journey of delivering packages is becoming more and more dangerous. The main, side, or simply helping other players that players need to accept will become more and more difficult. The game also designs a corresponding system to assist players and balance the difficulty curve. For example, in the order system, the route, requirements, and possible dangers on the road are displayed in detail; if you encounter difficulties, you can also seek material assistance from other players through Bridges Link. The foot-in-the-door phenomenon coupled with proper difficulty control can keep players in a state of flow.</p>
