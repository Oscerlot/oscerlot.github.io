<p>“Can someone help Kurumi?” — This is the most famous line of the hero Kurumi (Hu Tao) in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Kurumi is always easily targeted and besieged by enemies on the battlefield, and her classic voice line is also used very frequently, becoming a well-known mantra among <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> players.</p>
<p>But, is Kurumi really weak?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the actual combat situation: In an impressive trio match in last autumn’s Naraka Championship, Bilibili Gaming (BKG) player Huya丶niko saved his teammates at the last critical moment. He turned the tide with Kurumi and won the title of “God of War”. In daily games, many skilled players also say that Kurumi’s solo hero ranking is the most difficult, but also the most challenging.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that Kurumi is difficult to operate, but if played well, she can bring infinite possibilities to the team. High-level Kurumi players often become the “mastermind” of a team. It can be seen that Kurumi is not really weak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe0fbdced-8e98-4e79-8705-c1d9fb72c0ae.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e0fbdced-8e98-4e79-8705-c1d9fb72c0ae.png"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>So why do players often habitually think that these female characters are usually in a weak position in the game and need help? This article will analyze the positioning and changes of female characters in games in recent years from the following three aspects, and whether they are really “weak”.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Image-and-Positioning-of-Female-Characters-in-Early-Games"><a href="#1-The-Image-and-Positioning-of-Female-Characters-in-Early-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Image and Positioning of Female Characters in Early Games"></a>1. The Image and Positioning of Female Characters in Early Games</h2><p>In some early game works, there were indeed many female game characters who really “needed to be saved by others to survive”.</p>
<h3 id="The-Universal-Narrative-Formula-of-“Saving-the-Maiden”"><a href="#The-Universal-Narrative-Formula-of-“Saving-the-Maiden”" class="headerlink" title="The Universal Narrative Formula of “Saving the Maiden”"></a>The Universal Narrative Formula of “Saving the Maiden”</h3><p>Whether it’s the frequent appearance of “saving the kidnapped Peach” in the Super Mario series, or “finding the crystal and saving the princess” in the Zelda series, I believe many players are familiar with it. In fact, there are many similar plots of saving Princess Peach - Damsel in Distress is a relatively common narrative framework in early games. It comes from the French Demoiselle en Détresse, which can be simply translated as “a maiden in danger”. In such narratives, regardless of whether the female character has combat power, they are often in a helpless image of danger in the story, and are often set as the core incentive or motivation for the male protagonist to start the adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe0188a87-eb35-4254-ae6e-487ef906bfe2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e0188a87-eb35-4254-ae6e-487ef906bfe2.png"></p>
<p>These female characters usually appear as princesses, wives or sisters of male protagonists. When analyzing such female characters, the subject&#x2F;object dichotomy is usually used, that is, the subject acts and the object is acted upon. The subject can be understood as the protagonist, the central character of the story, and generally the main playable character in the game. In the Damsel in Distress narrative, it is usually assumed that the male is the subject and the female is placed in the role of the object. In the game, she usually becomes “the reward to be won”, “the treasure to be found”, or “the goal to be achieved”.</p>
<h3 id="The-Gender-Perspective-Behind-the-Story-Narration"><a href="#The-Gender-Perspective-Behind-the-Story-Narration" class="headerlink" title="The Gender Perspective Behind the Story Narration"></a>The Gender Perspective Behind the Story Narration</h3><p>The story narration of a game can usually reflect the perspective of the game maker and the worldview they want to express, and it will inevitably be reflected in the game. <em>Grand Theft Auto (GTA)</em>‘s gender controversy, objectification of female characters, and lack of inclusivity are often criticized: there are no female characters that can be played in the first person, no female characters that can influence the main storyline, and most female NPCs are also labeled with a single “sexy” tag. Every main poster of <em>GTA</em> must have a woman wearing overly revealing clothes, and the protagonist’s wife in the game is also set as a stripper.</p>
<p>Whether it is a game or a film and television work, if you want players to be immersed, a sense of story substitution is essential. Imagine, if female characters in the game can be arbitrarily abused, how will female players feel? Are the female game characters labeled “sexy” and “weak” a stereotype or an invisible misogynistic tendency? Nearly half of the game players in the United States are women, while women account for only 24% of the game developer group. Should the roles of women be presented by female practitioners to be more reasonable?</p>

<h3 id="Changes-in-the-Image-of-Women-in-Games-in-the-Past-20-Years"><a href="#Changes-in-the-Image-of-Women-in-Games-in-the-Past-20-Years" class="headerlink" title="Changes in the Image of Women in Games in the Past 20 Years"></a>Changes in the Image of Women in Games in the Past 20 Years</h3><p>In the 80s and 90s, the plot of “saving the distressed girl” once became a cliché in video games. Whether it was action fighting, role-playing, or first-person shooters, people were keen to add this old-fashioned but “effective” plot formula, and enjoyed it. And now, the old-fashioned plot of “saving the princess” and “saving the girl” has long been criticized and abandoned by the times.</p>
<p>In the past nearly 20 years, a significant change in female characters in games is playability. In the earliest video games, many female characters existed only to promote the plot. And now, female characters are no longer a kind of “accessory” or “catalyst”, but one of the game protagonists with combat capabilities, with maximum playability and controllability. EEDAR (Electronic Entertainment Design and Research) company counted in 2021 that 45% of 669 games, that is, 300 games, allow players to operate female characters, but there are 369 games that can only play male characters, and only 24 games can only play female characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fbe0f41a9-1c91-40ec-a720-d8c2d89c35ee.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;be0f41a9-1c91-40ec-a720-d8c2d89c35ee.png"></p>

<p><em>《Apex Legends》</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the point of gender balance and diversity, <em>Apex Legends</em> is an excellent model, achieving a high degree of balance in the proportion of hero gender and race. Bloodhound is called “they”, is it a male or a female? There are different opinions about the gender of this mysterious hunter, and some people say that ta is actually the only non-binary gender in the game.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Female-Characters-Like-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Female-Characters-Like-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Female Characters Like in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>2. What are the Female Characters Like in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><h3 id="Breaking-Stereotypes-The-Strong-in-the-Game-World"><a href="#Breaking-Stereotypes-The-Strong-in-the-Game-World" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Stereotypes - The Strong in the Game World"></a>Breaking Stereotypes - The Strong in the Game World</h3><p>In early games, the subjective consciousness of most female characters was often ignored. After being imprisoned, kidnapped, and cursed, did they never think of resisting or breaking free from the shackles of fate? Maybe they did, but the game setting often did not allow them to “escape successfully” until the male protagonist arrived. In recent years, in games, we can not only see that the stereotype of “the princess to be rescued” is being broken, but more importantly, more and more female game characters are changing their fate through their own struggles, rather than waiting in place to be “rescued”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F50eb5861-24a3-460e-976d-14266e0ccea5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;50eb5861-24a3-460e-976d-14266e0ccea5.png"></p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, whether it is playability, the positioning of female characters, or the self-awareness of characters, they are completely different from the weak images in past games. Of the twelve heroes currently open in the game, female characters account for half, each with talent skills that can mutually check and balance all heroes. Another breakthrough worth noting is that Yoto Hime (Ning Hongye), as the main promotional image of the game, is a female hero, and becomes the default protagonist in the novice tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fb5c68310-f85a-487d-9dec-c936476f4df4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;b5c68310-f85a-487d-9dec-c936476f4df4.png"></p>
<p>In the character background story of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the image of the female hero portrayed is very distinct and three-dimensional, with both a sense of power and combat effectiveness. There is the unyielding, beautiful and dangerous red snake, the swordsman Yoto Hime; the ghostly assassin Viper Ning (Jia Nan) who haunts the desert; the ambitious and resourceful sea overlord Tsuchimikado Kurumi (Cui Sanniang); and the ranger Justina Gu (Gu Qinghan) who was born as an imperial princess but wanders the world to bury her enemies in blood. Whether it is the Kunlun Goddess, the Desert Blackhawk, the Flower of Heliothis, or the Dragon King of the Mist Sea, these titles given to them all imply that they are “the strong” in their respective fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F02775539-6fae-4d22-8684-4b03bf9ffba7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;02775539-6fae-4d22-8684-4b03bf9ffba7.png"></p>
<h3 id="“My-Fate-is-up-to-Me”"><a href="#“My-Fate-is-up-to-Me”" class="headerlink" title="“My Fate is up to Me”"></a>“My Fate is up to Me”</h3><p>If analyzed by the subject-object dichotomy, they are undoubtedly the central subject of the game. Not only that, in the description of the hero’s legend, we can see their growth line and determination to become strong. For example, in the prologue of Tsuchimikado Kurumi’s hero story, her original words are “The weak can only drift with the tide and eventually be swallowed by the sea.” “And the strong will steer their own course, ride the wind and waves, and reach the shore of victory.” In many details of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, from the hero story to the description of an appearance, it is not difficult to see that female characters are given more dominant positions, and their own awareness of resistance is awakened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fc0b8a8d8-64e4-40d2-bc7e-d04f249bbf4b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;c0b8a8d8-64e4-40d2-bc7e-d04f249bbf4b.png"></p>
<h3 id="Seemingly-Weak-But-Can-Also-Be-a-“Savior”"><a href="#Seemingly-Weak-But-Can-Also-Be-a-“Savior”" class="headerlink" title="Seemingly Weak, But Can Also Be a “Savior”"></a>Seemingly Weak, But Can Also Be a “Savior”</h3><p>Finally, back to Kurumi. After several versions of iterations, although Kurumi’s skills and positioning have been repeatedly adjusted and modified, when it comes to Kurumi, players will not easily say the word “easy”. Although she has been beaten all the time, she is also very strong, and she must always judge the situation to support her teammates, and find opportunities to help dismantle the fire when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="3-Pay-Attention-to-Female-Players-and-Female-Characters-in-Games"><a href="#3-Pay-Attention-to-Female-Players-and-Female-Characters-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Pay Attention to Female Players and Female Characters in Games"></a>3. Pay Attention to Female Players and Female Characters in Games</h2><p>In fact, in current video games, the presence and importance of female characters are increasing. The ESA found in a survey that 48% of the surveyed players were women. Recently, a MOBA game producer also shared an interesting piece of data on Reddit, 97% of female players will only choose female characters, while the ratio of male players choosing male and female characters is 50% to 50%.</p>
<p>More and more players will choose female characters, which also requires game makers to set female characters from an equal perspective. Compared with the labeled masculinity and femininity, what is more important is how to define female characters - she can be a father’s daughter, a husband’s wife, a younger brother’s sister, but she should be herself more, and she can overcome difficulties, explore and conquer the world like other male characters.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In the setting of female game characters, many games no longer label them with stereotypes of traditional game females such as “weak”, “need to be rescued”, “accessories of the male protagonist”, etc. They are the protagonists themselves, brave, loyal, wise, powerful, and exemplary. Compared with some of the criticized Damsel in Distress settings in the early days, this is undoubtedly a forward-looking breakthrough and progress.</p>
<p>As the population of female game players is constantly growing, we believe that paying attention to and improving the situation of female characters in games, and then extending to exploring the needs of female players, will also be an important topic for user research. The importance of female players in today’s game market is obvious, and these newly emerging female players need respect and recognition from the game culture. By combining their demographic information, psycho-social environment, and the game culture they belong to, we user researchers have more directions worth studying.</p>
