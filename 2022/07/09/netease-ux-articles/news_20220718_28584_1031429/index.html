<p>When analyzing game sentiment, we often find that there may be significant contradictory perceptions among players regarding the size of the in-game map: when experiencing the same map, some players will report that the map is too large, while others will report that it is too small. Why does this contradiction occur?</p>
<p>By analyzing various factors that affect players’ perception of map size, this article will help you understand the source of this contradictory perception and, as a game designer, how to find a balance in this contradiction.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Large"><a href="#1-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Large" class="headerlink" title="1. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Large?"></a>1. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Large?</h2><p>“This game map is so big, every time I want to go to a target point, I need to run for a long time.”</p>
<p>“The map is too big, and I feel like I need to walk a long way to find relevant resources.”</p>
<p>“The map is a bit big, and I feel like I’ve been running and circling. What’s worse, I feel like I’m running very slowly, and I feel like the limited experience time is spent running.”</p>
<p>The above player feedback comes from a survival game we recently surveyed. Obviously, many players have reached a consistent conclusion on the issue of map size - the in-game map is too large, which affects their gaming experience to a certain extent. However, if we delve into the player feedback, we can find that the reasons why players feel that the game map is too large are significantly different. For example:</p>
<p>“This game map is so big, every time I want to go to a target point, I need to run for a long time.”</p>
<p>This is one of the important factors that affect players’ perception of map size: <strong>the arrangement of target coordinates within the map.</strong> For example, when we play battle royale games, we are accustomed to studying the coordinates of each target in the game map before choosing an airdrop point, and at the same time evaluating the possible resources around each location. If, in two maps of the same size, one map has a longer distance between targets, then the players will spend more time running and finding landmark targets, which will make them feel that the map is too large, “I feel like I can’t reach the target point no matter how I run.”</p>
<p>This perception of the game map being too large due to the long travel time is particularly obvious in games with significant time limits. For example, in battle royale games, players need to run out of the shrinking circle within the specified time. If the shrinking speed is too fast and the target point is too far away, players will naturally feel that “the map is so big, I can’t run to it.”</p>

<hr>
<p>In addition to the distribution of the coordinates themselves in the map, the distribution of corresponding effective resources will also greatly affect the player’s perception of map size. For example, in survival games that require collecting resources, making props, and then improving survival and combat capabilities, if the resource point distribution is too scattered, it will also make players feel tired of running around in the game, just like the player feedback mentioned above:</p>
<p>“The map is too big, and I feel like I need to walk a long way to find relevant resources.”</p>
<p>Maybe the map itself is not large, but in the life-and-death atmosphere created by the game, the resource distribution is too scattered and difficult to find, which will also make players transfer the experience difficulties they encounter to the map size design itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fef9570ce-39bd-4213-8157-729f9493f5eb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;ef9570ce-39bd-4213-8157-729f9493f5eb.png"></p>

<p><em>(Figure 3: A map of the S3 Ash Plain treasure chest distribution created by <em>LifeAfter</em> players)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, in addition to the distribution of target locations and resource points, the <strong>movement speed</strong> design of in-game characters also greatly affects players’ perception of the game map size, especially in some games without significant map instructions, where players need to constantly experience and finally “measure the map size with their feet.” The difference in spatial size perception caused by this movement speed design problem is also particularly obvious. For example, in the following player feedback, compared to the game map size itself, movement speed may be an important factor affecting their gaming experience:</p>
<p>“The map is a bit big, and I feel like I’ve been running and circling. What’s worse, I feel like I’m running very slowly, and I feel like the limited experience time is spent running.”</p>
<p>In order to reduce the impact of in-game movement speed on players’ perception of spatial size to a certain extent, many games have added many mechanisms to increase movement speed in the running design, such as in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which innovatively designed a grappling hook mechanism, which can help players quickly smooth out the disadvantages caused by geographical location and increase the excitement of in-game melee combat and running.</p>

What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Small?"></a>2. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Small?</h2><p>The above are some of the factors that we have compiled in our daily work that will lead players to believe that the game map is too large. So, what factors might make players feel that the in-game map is too small? We believe there may be the following situations:</p>
<p>First, it may be that <strong>the sense of spatial closure caused by too many obstacles</strong> makes players think that the in-game map is too small. For example, in a study on the experience of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> players, we found that a considerable number of players who have experienced other FPS games will think that some scenes in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> are too small, for example:</p>
<p>“The real combat area is too small, and it feels often crowded.”</p>
<p>“The indoor structure space is small, and it is not easy to carry out offensive and defensive cooperation.”</p>
<p>If you carefully study the player’s feedback, you can find that the problem that players complain about is not that the overall combat map is too small, but that the combat area in the scene is small and the combat distance is too close, which may make players face frontal attacks. , The space for maneuvering and retreating is limited. One prominent design of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is that there are many scene elements (such as obstacles) that affect combat, which may cause some players who are accustomed to long-range combat in open spaces to get stuck at the initial stage of the experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F7ace1dc0-2b22-4143-954e-cf3e3db3d411.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;7ace1dc0-2b22-4143-954e-cf3e3db3d411.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Figure 5: Combat scene of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, <strong>the limited number of explorable target points and resource points in the map and their concentrated distribution, or the fast movement speed in the game</strong>, may also make some players who have the desire to explore the map think that the in-game map is too small and lacks challenge.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Seek-Balance-in-the-Face-of-the-Perceptual-Paradox-of-“Too-Big”-and-“Too-Small”"><a href="#3-How-to-Seek-Balance-in-the-Face-of-the-Perceptual-Paradox-of-“Too-Big”-and-“Too-Small”" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Seek Balance in the Face of the Perceptual Paradox of “Too Big” and “Too Small”"></a>3. How to Seek Balance in the Face of the Perceptual Paradox of “Too Big” and “Too Small”</h2><p>Whether it is a game designer or a user researcher, when we encounter contradictory sensory feedback such as the in-game map being too large, too small, and other similar sensory contradictions, how should we seek balance? Before implementing real design modifications and optimizations, we can think as follows:</p>
<p>First, what kind of player made a specific perception of space size?</p>
<p>From the above analysis, we can see that the player’s own game experience and preferences may have a significant impact on their spatial perception ability. For example, for players with strong exploration desires, they will prefer a map size design that is vast and can stimulate the desire to run and explore.</p>
<p>Secondly, do players have other deeper game needs besides feedback that the map is too big or too small? Compared with the feedback that the map itself is too big or too small, what we need to do more is to dig deep into the players’ deep-seated game motivations and needs, and optimize the game mechanism for these deep-seated needs. For example, reducing running time and using the limited time for exciting frontal battles and strategic play; or wanting to collect resource materials as soon as possible to achieve more game achievements.</p>
