<p>When describing a game’s combat system, we often hear words like “satisfying,” “exciting,” and “explosive.” We also often hear comments about the game’s fast-paced combat and tight level design. So, does the thrill of a combat game rely solely on speed?</p>
<p><em>Sifu</em>, as a fighting game, has received a lot of praise since its launch. Similar to many kung fu movies, the protagonist often faces a room full of enemies, being ganged up on. The dodging, blocking, posture system, and complex combo mechanics of upper and lower attacks require players to constantly observe the enemy’s movements and react quickly and correctly. The overall fighting rhythm of the game is very fast, making your fingers sore from button mashing, but there is a very important “Focus” skill system. When used, it slows down the movements of all surrounding enemies, allowing the protagonist to unleash a powerful blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F4f56927e-11db-4a5d-8718-76f0b08ac2f4.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;4f56927e-11db-4a5d-8718-76f0b08ac2f4.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Using the Focus skill “Powerful Sweep Kick”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sudden slowing down of the camera during combat does not give players a sluggish experience. On the contrary, it can increase the richness of the game mechanics and enhance the feeling of impact. Looking back at other games I’ve played before, this slow-motion mechanism is actually very common. Although they are all slow-motion, the experience they bring to players varies due to different trigger mechanisms and trigger scenes.</p>
<h2 id="1-Ranged-Attacks-Assisting-Aim-Enhancing-Expressiveness"><a href="#1-Ranged-Attacks-Assisting-Aim-Enhancing-Expressiveness" class="headerlink" title="1. Ranged Attacks - Assisting Aim, Enhancing Expressiveness"></a>1. Ranged Attacks - Assisting Aim, Enhancing Expressiveness</h2><p>In 1999, the movie <em>The Matrix</em> made the “bullet time” filming technique famous. The instantaneous trajectory of the bullet was clearly presented to the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F1f816a50-1246-4e5f-a17c-6c35b41fdd8a.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;1f816a50-1246-4e5f-a17c-6c35b41fdd8a.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The famous bullet time scene in “The Matrix”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The airflow, smoke, flying cape, and 360-degree rotating camera position all made this bullet-dodging scene achieve the ultimate expressiveness. This slow-motion presentation method was later not only used in many gunfight movies, but also in many combat games that use ranged weapons.</p>
<p>In <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, when the player draws the bow, triggering Focus or jumping will enter a slow-motion state. All scene dynamics and the player’s actions will be slowed down. In addition to helping players better aim at the opponent, the effect triggered by the arrow hitting is also more visually impactful.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the rhythm of the lens is not a single slow. The process of releasing the arrow is still rapid, while the explosion is slow. In the slow-motion perspective, a huge mecha creature rushes towards you, and the rocket ignites the fuel tank on its back. Steel and fire blend together in an instant, and the burning picture is frozen. The slow-fast-slow processing method expresses the “sense of impact” to the fullest.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>《Horizon Zero Dawn》: Rocket Hitting a Mecha</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, using the “Dead Eye” skill can enter the auxiliary aiming state. In this state, not only will the character’s actions slow down, but after the Dead Eye skill is upgraded, it can also mark multiple enemies during this slow-motion period to complete a burst of bullets, and view the enemy’s weak points (such as the head, heart, lungs, etc.) to achieve the purpose of one-hit kill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F20551f69-bc01-4bb7-a47f-b23e603a2a55.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;20551f69-bc01-4bb7-a47f-b23e603a2a55.gif"></p>

Melee Combat - Time Window, Special Skills, Powerful Counterattacks"></a>2. Melee Combat - Time Window, Special Skills, Powerful Counterattacks</h2><p>The mechanism of using slow motion in melee games is different from that of ranged attacks. Melee combat does not have the problem of aiming, but it is usually fast-paced and has a low fault tolerance rate. Therefore, many games use slow motion to provide players with a certain reaction time window.</p>
<p><em>Katana ZERO</em> is a pixel-style fighting game. The enemies move fast, and some even have bullets. The player has no health bar, only a katana in their hand. Therefore, they either kill the enemy with one slash or are instantly killed by the enemy. In addition to direct fast attacks, players can actively trigger “bullet time,” and the picture will enter slow motion. During this process, they can deflect bullets or take the opportunity to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F6f5e79e6-8bcb-45b6-99a4-c9758b0305d8.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;6f5e79e6-8bcb-45b6-99a4-c9758b0305d8.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bullet Time in《Katana ZERO》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In “bullet time” mode, the screen turns black, and only the protagonist and the target are lit up, as well as the attack animation. This mechanism lowers the operating threshold for players who are not pursuing extreme speedruns. However, due to the visual impact of the before-and-after comparison, the undiminished speed of the attack effects, and the slow-motion blood splatter, the thrill of the game is not weakened.</p>
<p>Other games use slow motion as a transition between the player’s parry&#x2F;dodge and a powerful counterattack, as a foreshadowing of the powerful counterattack, making the thrill of the counterattack stronger.</p>
<p>The perfect parry in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and Link Time in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> are such examples. After the player parries the enemy’s attack at a specific moment or successfully dodges the enemy’s attack, they will enter a short slow-motion phase. At this time, the player can launch a powerful counterattack against the enemy. Since this kind of bullet time is not completely actively triggered by the player at any time, it requires players to be familiar with the attack animations of different enemies in order to master the appropriate button timing. Also, because it is difficult to master and has high returns, the sense of accomplishment brought by triggering a perfect parry&#x2F;perfect dodge is even stronger.</p>

Supporting Visual Performance - Focusing on Key Points, Enhancing Feedback"></a>3. Supporting Visual Performance - Focusing on Key Points, Enhancing Feedback</h2><p>Slow motion changes more than just the rhythm of the camera. Looking at the games mentioned above, when slow motion is triggered, players often have a clear goal. Therefore, in order to highlight this goal and enhance the player’s combat thrill, games usually make some other screen processing.</p>
<h3 id="Focusing-on-the-Subject-Weakening-Invalid-Information"><a href="#Focusing-on-the-Subject-Weakening-Invalid-Information" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on the Subject, Weakening Invalid Information"></a>Focusing on the Subject, Weakening Invalid Information</h3><p>Usually, in such critical moments, the game tries to focus the player’s attention on the target they are currently focusing on. Common methods include changing the screen color&#x2F;radially blurring the surrounding picture&#x2F;enlarging the subject, etc.</p>
<p>Unifying the picture into a monochromatic tone and highlighting the current target subject with the original color or other emphasizing colors is a very useful method. <em>Katana ZERO</em> and <em>Sifu</em>, mentioned above, are such examples. Unimportant scenes are greatly weakened during the slow-motion process, and the attack effects and both the enemy and the player stand out in such scenes.</p>

<p>Other games radially blur the surrounding picture, making the blurred lines converge towards the center of the picture, which is the target subject, making the picture seem to have speed lines in comics. And the direction lines of this blur also serve as a visual guide for players, making the clear target subject in the center more eye-catching.</p>

<p>After the irrelevant information in the picture is weakened, if some UIs of specific skills are added at this time, they will also become more eye-catching. Just like the Focus skill option wheel attached to the enemy silhouette in <em>Sifu</em> and the counterattack prompt key in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, the enhanced UI will not make players feel abrupt. Instead, it can allow players to notice the most important information in a short time and focus their attention.</p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the out-of-game grappling hook display system also uses bullet time. The camera stretches towards the direction of the grappling hook launch, focusing the subject of the picture on the grappling hook. Slow motion is used during the launch process, and the original speed is restored when the grappling hook is deployed. Between the contrast of fast and slow, the grappling hook, as an important functional appearance, is shown in great detail.</p>

There must be slow and fast, forming a contrast, so that the freeze frame will be more exciting, and the strike will be more shocking. Therefore, the attack performance after the end of slow motion is often more prominent than ordinary attacks. For example, the powerful counterattacks mentioned earlier.</p>

Summary</h2><p>The use of slow motion in film and television works greatly enhances the expressiveness of the picture, and it is more than that in games. As a gameplay mechanism, slow motion can assist players in aiming and highlight more important information in ranged attacks, while in melee combat, it can provide players with reaction time and provide block feedback. And its own visual expressiveness is added with the unique artistry of the game. Fast and slow, strong and weak, color and black and white, the contrast between before and after complements each other.</p>
