<h2 id="1-Application-of-Gamification-in-Communities"><a href="#1-Application-of-Gamification-in-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1. Application of Gamification in Communities"></a>1. Application of Gamification in Communities</h2><p>Since the 1980s, scholars in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have continuously tried to use games to inspire exploration in non-game scenarios such as education and sociology. In research, the concept of gamification mostly focuses on the inspiration brought by game design, gameplay, and user experience. Gamification itself is an informal and inclusive explanation, usually referring to the application of game elements in non-game scenarios to improve user experience and engagement.</p>
<p>In online communities and social media, gamification design has also seen increasing applications: from the evaluation system of shopping websites, to restaurant and takeout reviews, to the achievement system of Q&amp;A websites, and so on. The common feature of these websites and communities is that they rely on user output to develop and maintain the community. Therefore, how to encourage users to participate in the community has become one of the main goals of these communities.</p>
<p>Preece &amp; Schneiderman, in “The Reader-to-Leader Framework”, divided community users into five levels according to their degree of participation: all users, readers, contributors, collaborators, and leaders. Two of the major factors affecting community members’ willingness to contribute are: the visibility of members’ contributions and the recognition of members’ high-quality contributions and expertise.</p>
<p>Just as outstanding students in school can get red stars, and students with excellent grades can occupy the top of the leaderboard, achievements and badges in games are also a recognition and reward for players’ achievements. Similarly, by using gamification methods to design some virtual rewards to stimulate community members, more people can actively participate in community building, and at the same time, it can better highlight active community members and create a good community atmosphere. As a common virtual reward in communities, the design of community badges can also be considered from multiple perspectives such as the value, meaning, and distribution management methods of the badge itself.</p>
<h2 id="2-Badge-Design-in-Communities"><a href="#2-Badge-Design-in-Communities" class="headerlink" title="2. Badge Design in Communities"></a>2. Badge Design in Communities</h2><p>In the community, as one of the incentives for members to participate in the community, the design of badges is also varied. The famous online forum Discuz! once released the badge function in its Discuz! X2.5.</p>
<p><em>Various Discuz! badges used in a singer’s official forum</em></p>
<p>In overseas community forums, the developer community Stack Overflow has designed different achievement badges for different user scenarios and preferences in order to encourage users to participate in community activities. In order to encourage users to answer questions, Stack Overflow provides a variety of badges for different user levels, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guru badge:</strong> Guru means mentor in religion, and in Stack Overflow, this badge means that the member’s answer is accepted by the questioner and gets more than 40 points (in Stack Overflow, each time a member’s answer is liked, it gets 1 point, and each time it is disliked, it gets -1 point);</li>
<li><strong>Self-Learner badge:</strong> Refers to the member who answered his own question, and the answer received more than 3 points;</li>
<li><strong>Tenacious badge:</strong> Represents that the member has more than 5 answers with 0 points, and the 0-point answers account for more than 20% of their total answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These various badge designs cover the user scenarios of different levels, and purposefully render the atmosphere of the community encouraging users to create together - no matter what kind of questions are answered, no matter how many likes are received, it is a behavior worthy of encouragement in the community. Similar to the Tenacious badge, there are also many achievement titles in games, such as the Lucky Star and Koi achievements in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which claim to be mixed into the front row.</p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Koi Achievement</em></p>
<h3 id="Facebook-Group-Badges"><a href="#Facebook-Group-Badges" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Group Badges"></a>Facebook Group Badges</h3><p>In 2017, the global social media platform Facebook launched the badge function in its group section “Facebook Group”, and in 2018 began to promote it to eligible communities (with more than 50 members). Administrators of eligible communities can manage the display configuration of badges related to the community in the Facebook Group backend panel. The Facebook Community officially explained that this function was established to “clarify the identity of administrators, reward community members who have made outstanding contributions, and enhance mutual understanding among members.”</p>
<p><em>Facebook Group backend management page related to badges: Administrators can only enable or disable a specific badge, and the distribution and rules of badges are completed by the Facebook platform and backend algorithms</em></p>
<p>In the game community research, Lei Huo UX’s user researchers evaluated the comprehensibility, information content, and distinguishability of the 6 common Facebook Group badges at that time. The research results show that Facebook Group badges play a role in emphasizing member roles and increasing member exposure, but specific badges may also cause readers and administrators to have certain biases when browsing the content of the post while prompting the identity of the post author. Since the badge distribution rules are not clear, core members of the community will have different understandings of the meaning of specific badges based on their own experience. In the eyes of users, what is more important than badges is the “poster itself” and the “content of the post”.</p>
<p><em>The 6 types of Facebook Group badges included in the study</em></p>
<p>By introducing a system similar to badge achievements in the community through gamification, for users who read posts, badges that prompt the author’s authority or the length of time the user has participated in the community (such as Admin, Moderator, New Member, Founding Member) will have a certain impact on their understanding of the content. Members believe that the speeches of administrators and old members are “more authoritative”, the content of the posts is “more trustworthy”, and will also attract more attention and discussion. Administrators themselves also said that under the extra exposure brought by the badges, they will pay more attention to restraining their behavior to create a good community atmosphere. Conversely, for the content published by new members, members will “lower their expectations” and “understand them patiently and empathetically.”</p>
<p>For other badges related to the frequency and content of posts, there will not be much difference in content understanding from ordinary posts. The high exposure brought by badges will relatively amplify some shortcomings and mistakes in the content. From the perspective of administrators, these posts will also be “more eye-catching”. For example, the “Conversation Starter” badge in the Facebook Group, the designer’s original intention was to commend members who put forward “meaningful discussions” in the community, but the statistical method of this badge only considered the number of replies to the original post, and the content quality of the original post was not included in the consideration of this badge, which led to some of the members who were awarded the Conversation Starter badge after the function was released being members who often provoked conflicts in the community. Users actually feel that such badges are “unrealistic”, and administrators believe that such badges will cause their “extra attention” when they appear after a period of adaptation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Top Fan badge belongs to the Facebook Page and was not originally included in this research plan, but many users still mentioned this badge during the interview.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Brought-by-Badge-Design-to-Game-Communities"><a href="#3-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Brought-by-Badge-Design-to-Game-Communities" class="headerlink" title="3. Opportunities and Challenges Brought by Badge Design to Game Communities"></a>3. Opportunities and Challenges Brought by Badge Design to Game Communities</h2><p>By introducing achievement and badge systems in the community through the concept of gamification, it can encourage community members to participate in interaction to a certain extent and enhance community stickiness. However, there are many differences in the social purposes of players in the game and in the community, and community badges cannot simply copy the achievement system in the game. Easeley &amp; Ghosh (2016) proposed. In the community, if you want to design a competitive ranking badge similar to “highest contribution”, using absolute values (such as the top 10) in the badge acquisition conditions is more helpful for community members to understand the value of the badge than using relative percentages (the top 1%).</p>
<p>As designers, when designing badges for game communities, they should also consider the transparency of the rules, the interpretability, sustainability, and flexibility of badges in different communities. In the design process of community badges, for the choice of badge name and the specific description of the badge, designers should find a balance between improving interpretability and simplicity, and should also consider the actual situation of the community, allowing users to participate in the customization process of badges, so that the badge achievement system can be better used by the community and create and maintain a good community atmosphere.</p>
