</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, the domestic game user market in China has become saturated, and the user dividend has gradually disappeared. However, game manufacturers still regard the domestic market as the main distribution market, resulting in the incremental market gradually becoming a stock market. There are structural development opportunities in the international market, with huge potential. Many game manufacturers have begun to turn their attention overseas, seeking opportunities for games to go global.</p>
<p>South Korea, as a country with a top-ranking game market scale in Asia and even globally, has become one of the must-select markets for game companies from various countries due to its developed game industry, mature e-sports ecosystem, and strong player spending power. In recent years, many Chinese games have also achieved excellent results in the Korean market. In 2021, among the games released overseas by China, 33 entered the Top 100 Korean mobile games by revenue, with revenue reaching US$980 million, accounting for 22.3% of the Top 100 total revenue. In recent years, more and more overseas games and IPs have entered the Korean market, and competition has become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Going overseas has become an important strategic choice for most game companies. Before going overseas, understanding the corresponding market environment and user characteristics is an indispensable link. By familiarizing yourself with the characteristics of the market and avoiding cultural conflicts, you can avoid detours and effectively occupy market advantages. This article will analyze the Korean game market with huge potential and provide relevant localization optimization suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Scale-and-Trends-of-the-Korean-Game-Market"><a href="#1-Scale-and-Trends-of-the-Korean-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Scale and Trends of the Korean Game Market"></a>1. Scale and Trends of the Korean Game Market</h2><h3 id="The-Korean-Game-Market-Ranks-Fourth-in-the-World"><a href="#The-Korean-Game-Market-Ranks-Fourth-in-the-World" class="headerlink" title="The Korean Game Market Ranks Fourth in the World"></a>The Korean Game Market Ranks Fourth in the World</h3><p>According to the “2021 Korean Game White Paper”, the Korean game market accounts for 6.9% of the global market, and it maintains a relatively fast growth trend. In 2019, the scale of the Korean game market ranked fifth in the world, and in 2020, it surpassed the United Kingdom and became the fourth largest game market in the world, second only to the United States, China, and Japan.</p>

In 2020, the scale of the Korean game market increased by 21.3%, reaching 18.9 trillion won (approximately RMB 100 billion). The main reason for the growth of the game industry in 2020 is the increase in indoor activities due to the impact of the epidemic. (Data source: 2021 Korean Game White Paper)</p>
<p>The scale of the Korean game market has maintained a continuous growth trend since 2014. In 2021, it even exceeded 20 trillion won (approximately 107 billion yuan), setting a new record for the Korean game market. In 2023, it is likely to form a large-scale market of 23.46 trillion won (approximately 125.4 billion yuan).</p>

Platform Breakdown of the Korean Game Market</h2><h3 id="Mobile-Games-Account-for-the-Highest-Proportion-Console-Games-Show-a-Growth-Trend"><a href="#Mobile-Games-Account-for-the-Highest-Proportion-Console-Games-Show-a-Growth-Trend" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Games Account for the Highest Proportion, Console Games Show a Growth Trend"></a>Mobile Games Account for the Highest Proportion, Console Games Show a Growth Trend</h3><p>From 2014 to 2020, from the perspective of the revenue share of each platform, the market share of PC games continued to decrease, while the share of mobile games increased the most every year. The share of console games was not large, but it also achieved small growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F77972732-1e61-4450-8222-49d022bd8eb0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;77972732-1e61-4450-8222-49d022bd8eb0.png"></p>
<p>In 2020, among the revenue distribution of various platforms in the Korean game industry, mobile games accounted for the largest proportion, 63.5%, PC games accounted for 28.7%, console games accounted for 6.4%, and arcade games accounted for 1.3%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Ffa904b5a-947f-4901-9754-62cbc5338351.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;fa904b5a-947f-4901-9754-62cbc5338351.png"></p>
<p>In mobile game revenue, South Korea’s three major game manufacturers “3N” (NCSOFT, Nexon, Netmarble) still lead the mobile game market. NCSOFT’s Lineage IP games occupy the upstream, and Nexon’s “The Kingdom of the Winds”, “KartRider Rush+” and other games are also very impressive. However, in 2021, after the launch of Kakao’s “Odin: Valhalla Rising”, NCSOFT’s revenue decreased due to word-of-mouth and other factors; Nexon had no new blockbuster games launched, and the performance of old games was sluggish, and revenue continued to decline; although Netmarble had “Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds” launched, the game did not bring revenue growth. In 2021, the three major Korean manufacturers failed to achieve breakthrough growth, and their influence gradually declined, while domestic game manufacturers in China are catching up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F106cc82c-6ebe-4144-a387-224a5f2dca40.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;106cc82c-6ebe-4144-a387-224a5f2dca40.png"></p>
<p>The scale of the PC game market decreased slightly by 4% compared with the previous year. The main reasons are the relatively high R&amp;D costs of PC games, the gradual shift of users to mobile games, and the reduction of new games. The report predicts that the scale of the Korean PC game market will stagnate or decline in the future. The revenue of Korean Internet cafes in 2020 was also affected by the epidemic, down 11.9%.</p>
<p>The sales of the console game market increased by 57.3% compared with the previous year, with a large increase. It is speculated that the explosive growth of console games was mainly affected by the popularity of Nintendo Switch and “Animal Crossing”. In addition, more and more manufacturers are porting mobile or computer games to consoles, with a focus on indie games. With the increase of Korean companies such as Pearl Abyss and Smilegate that develop console masterpieces, the Korean console game market will continue to maintain a high growth momentum in the future. It is estimated that the sales of the console game market in 2021 will increase by 17.3% compared with the previous year, reaching 1.2815 trillion won (this is predicted data, the real data has not yet been disclosed).</p>
<p>In the past two years, “3N” has successively announced its strategic console games. For example, NCSOFT will launch the massively multiplayer online role-playing game “Throne and Liberty”, NEXON will launch the racing game “KartRider: Drift” in the form of a console, and Netmarble launched “Seven Knights: Time Wanderer” in 2020, which ported its masterpiece “Seven Knights” to the console game platform Switch. It is not difficult to see that the reason why “3N” is tightening the reins of entering the console game is related to the stagnation of the market in its existing main areas and the huge potential of the console market.</p>
<h2 id="3-User-Portrait-of-Korean-Players"><a href="#3-User-Portrait-of-Korean-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. User Portrait of Korean Players"></a>3. User Portrait of Korean Players</h2><p>According to Newzoo’s statistics on the age structure of players around the world in 2022, 46% of Korean players are 18-34 years old, and more than 50% of players are over 35 years old. The overall age of players is older. Older players have high spending power, which also determines the strong willingness of Korean players to spend on games.</p>
<h3 id="PC-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-Players-is-Significantly-Higher-Than-That-of-Female-Players"><a href="#PC-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-Players-is-Significantly-Higher-Than-That-of-Female-Players" class="headerlink" title="PC Game Players: The Proportion of Male Players is Significantly Higher Than That of Female Players"></a>PC Game Players: The Proportion of Male Players is Significantly Higher Than That of Female Players</h3><p>Among Korean game players, the usage rate of PC games is 59.1%.</p>
<p>Among PC players, the proportion of female players is 34.7%, and the proportion of male players is 65.3%. From the perspective of age distribution, players aged 20-30 have the highest proportion, accounting for 28.4%, followed by the 30-40 and 40-50 age groups, accounting for 20.1% and 21.6% respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fc9fdd89c-3c04-4bbc-8747-6003b0cc8a57.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;c9fdd89c-3c04-4bbc-8747-6003b0cc8a57.png"></p>
<p>● PC Game Genre Preferences:</p>
<p>From the perspective of the game genres that PC game players often experience, the top five game genres are RPG&#x2F;MMORPG, FPS&#x2F;TPS, Simulation, AOS, and Sports. Players aged 20-30 prefer to play games such as “League of Legends”, “PUBG”, “FIFA”, and “Overwatch”. The younger the players, the higher the proportion of experiencing AOS and racing genres, and they also prefer to play games with friends; from the perspective of gender, female players prefer games such as simulation, racing, and puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="Mobile-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-and-Female-Players-is-Basically-the-Same"><a href="#Mobile-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-and-Female-Players-is-Basically-the-Same" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Game Players: The Proportion of Male and Female Players is Basically the Same"></a>Mobile Game Players: The Proportion of Male and Female Players is Basically the Same</h3><p>Among Korean game players, the usage rate of mobile games is 91.1%.</p>
<p>In the gender distribution of mobile game players, the proportion of male players is 50.7%, and the proportion of female players is 49.3%. The proportion of males and females is basically the same, each accounting for half. Compared with China, which is also an Asian country, the proportion of male and female players in South Korea is more balanced: among Chinese mobile game players, males account for 61.7% and females account for 38.3%, with males significantly higher than females.</p>

<p>Compared with mobile game players, there are fewer young players in console games, which is also related to spending power and family environment. The development of the Korean console market is relatively late compared with the United States and Japan. In the 1990s, Japan occupied the console market, but because of cultural restrictions in South Korea, it was also difficult to import games, and the development of the console market was relatively slow. And most Korean families have TVs in the living room. Without the consent of family members, it is impossible to enjoy console games in the living room, which also has certain restrictions on students’ experience of console games.</p>
<h2 id="4-Characteristics-of-the-Korean-Mobile-Game-Market"><a href="#4-Characteristics-of-the-Korean-Mobile-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="4. Characteristics of the Korean Mobile Game Market"></a>4. Characteristics of the Korean Mobile Game Market</h2><h3 id="Mainly-MMORPG-Genre"><a href="#Mainly-MMORPG-Genre" class="headerlink" title="Mainly MMORPG Genre"></a>Mainly MMORPG Genre</h3><p>Compared with China, the Korean mobile game market has lower diversity and is mainly MMORPG. In 2021, among the Top 3 Korean mobile games by revenue, the sales of the MMORPG genre accounted for 70%. Among them, the sales of Lineage IP games accounted for more than 30%.</p>
<p>South Korea can be said to be the holy land of MMORPG. There is also a saying that it is “Korean-made MMORPG”. Why is this game genre so popular in South Korea? What are the reasons? What are the characteristics of Korean MMORPGs? The following points are summarized for these questions.</p>
<p>● The Influence of Korea’s First Generation MMORPG</p>
<p>When it comes to Korean MMORPG, we must mention “The Kingdom of the Winds” and “Lineage”. “The Kingdom of the Winds” is a PC game developed and published by NEXON in 1996. This year marks its 26th anniversary. It is the world’s longest-running and representative first multiplayer online game in the history of Korean games. The game also created a lot of innovative gameplay, including resurrection, purchase-type growth and other systems. After reaching the full level, you will not continue to upgrade, but you can provide continuous growth motivation by purchasing HP&#x2F;MP, hunting to obtain additional experience, etc. This form is also used in current games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe50e2a46-11a7-4bd4-850a-06744c08ef14.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e50e2a46-11a7-4bd4-850a-06744c08ef14.jpg"></p>
<p>“Lineage” is a PC game developed and published by NCSOFT in 1998. At that time, “Lineage” had two main highlights. The first was the picture quality&#x2F;sound effects, and the second was the siege warfare. It induced competition among players through a relatively free PVP mode, and you could obtain props by killing other players. The unprecedented siege warfare system aroused the players’ sense of team honor, and the blood alliance system provided players with a sense of belonging. After these two games achieved great success in South Korea, MMORPG seems to have become the preferred game genre for other Korean manufacturers. After 2000, games such as “Black Desert”, “Mabinogi”, “MU Online”, and “Lineage” series were launched successively. With the explosion of the mobile game market, these PC games have successively launched mobile games with the same IP.</p>
<p>● Characteristics of Korean MMORPG - Highlighting of Hunting Gameplay and Convenient Operation</p>
<p>Compared with other overseas games of the same type, Korean MMORPGs emphasize hunting gameplay more. From the perspective of R&amp;D, development resources can be saved. Instead of creating a brand new gameplay, adding monsters and maps can achieve hunting gameplay. Players who have experienced the “Lineage” PC game in the past have long been accustomed to Lineage-style simple operations, while complex operations and diverse skill systems, which require familiarity with precise strategies and continuous long-term operations in multiplayer battles, will not be favored by these players over 40 years old. Therefore, this simple Korean-style operation method has become a representative feature of Lineage. This very strong preference has formed a fixed model in the Korean market, and the hunting gameplay can obtain effective returns in a low-cost way, which also meets their needs.</p>
<h3 id="Android-Revenue-Accounts-for-More-Than-70"><a href="#Android-Revenue-Accounts-for-More-Than-70" class="headerlink" title="Android Revenue Accounts for More Than 70%"></a>Android Revenue Accounts for More Than 70%</h3><p>The paid platforms for Korean mobile games are Google Play, App Store, and One Store, with revenue shares of 73.8%, 11.8%, and 14.8%, respectively. The proportion of the Google Play platform is relatively high, which is related to the high popularity of Android system phones. In the Korean mobile phone operating system market in 2021, the Android system accounted for 72.6%, and the IOS system accounted for 27.1%.</p>

Localization Suggestions</h2><h3 id="Game-Art-Style-and-Picture-Quality"><a href="#Game-Art-Style-and-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Game Art Style and Picture Quality"></a>Game Art Style and Picture Quality</h3><p>Most Korean game players prefer European and American realistic, fantasy, Nordic and other styles. Many Korean players will directly give up experiencing the game because of the game style. Therefore, game manufacturers need to consider the audience of the game style when going overseas to Korea. Game picture quality has a greater impact on Korean players. In the MMORPG mobile game player game experience survey, the demand for “high-quality pictures” is much higher than other options, accounting for 30.4%, diverse gameplay accounts for 15%, and fast and simple experience accounts for 13.7%.</p>

<h3 id="Text"><a href="#Text" class="headerlink" title="Text"></a>Text</h3><p>Korean game players have higher requirements for the text in the game. Players will point out typos, machine translations, and system display errors in the game, and will also evaluate the character names and plot translations. If the game is released globally, there will be communication and interaction between overseas players. Character names also need to consider the communication problems of players from various countries in the game, and try to ensure consistency. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider local cultural customs, holidays, etc. If you want to succeed in the Korean game market, improving the overall translation quality is also an indispensable link.</p>
<h3 id="UI-Section"><a href="#UI-Section" class="headerlink" title="UI Section"></a>UI Section</h3><p>Compared with Chinese games, most Korean game UI interfaces are relatively simpler. Therefore, when entering the Korean market, the UI interface can be appropriately simplified and optimized, which may be more in line with the gaming habits of Korean users.</p>

<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The Korean game market has an extremely important position in the world, and it has also become one of the regions that Chinese game manufacturers must focus on when going overseas. However, it has very unique features in terms of game categories, player preferences, player portraits, and localization.
