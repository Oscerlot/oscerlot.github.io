</blockquote>
<p>“Souls-like” games, a unique genre created by game producer Hidetaka Miyazaki, are almost synonymous with “torture”. Unlike most games, Souls-like games have a very high learning curve, requiring players to fight in a world full of dangers and survive countless difficult boss battles. Even a little carelessness can cause the player to die at the hands of a roadside mob. This “torturous” experience has fascinated a large number of players, who curse at repeated deaths while being inseparably pursuing the hard-won victory.</p>
<p>In April 2021, at the Golden Joysticks, the oldest video game award ceremony, the public voted <em>Dark Souls</em> as the greatest game of all time. And the latest Souls-like game, <em>Elden Ring</em>, sold 12 million copies worldwide in half a month, becoming another ten-million-selling IP under FromSoftware.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fee32c3aa-74f3-45d8-aaf3-4b9b1a2365c8.jpg/size/" alt="Elden Ring"></p>
<p>With many games opting to lower the learning curve to attract users, how can Souls-like games be so difficult and hardcore, yet achieve such excellent sales? One of the big reasons is that Souls-like games have a unique temperament that can give players a distinctive emotional experience, which makes them stand out among many trendy games. This article discusses how Souls-like games capture the hearts of players from the perspective of emotional experience.</p>
<h2 id="1-Unique-“Dark”-Emotional-Experience"><a href="#1-Unique-“Dark”-Emotional-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. Unique “Dark” Emotional Experience"></a>1. Unique “Dark” Emotional Experience</h2><p>Today’s game genres are basically divided based on the core gameplay of the game, which has created a situation where conventional games may have innovations in gameplay, but their emotional experience tends to be homogenized. The reason why Souls-like games are so successful is that they create a very strong dark, apocalyptic atmosphere, thus avoiding the homogenization of game emotions and emotional experiences, and making them stand out among many competitors.</p>
<h3 id="Core-Experience-of-Difficulty-and-Exploration"><a href="#Core-Experience-of-Difficulty-and-Exploration" class="headerlink" title="Core Experience of Difficulty and Exploration"></a>Core Experience of Difficulty and Exploration</h3><p>The special death mechanism, dark artistic expression, obscure narrative techniques, and the overall atmosphere created by the game together constitute the “Souls-like flavor” that players are fascinated by. This unique emotional experience can be summarized as “difficulty” and “exploration.”</p>
<p>“Difficulty” is the persistence of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s game aesthetics and the core part of the player experience. Previous “Souls” works, including the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, have the essence of allowing players to constantly learn in ridiculously difficult battles until they develop a suitable attack routine. The core experience is “gaining a sense of accomplishment by constantly overcoming difficulties.” Death is not just a sign of failure. When players continue to overcome difficulties in repeated deaths and finally achieve victory on their own, the previous deaths are given great meaning - constant death is for the sake of overcoming death.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fb52a1b19-2f5c-4744-850e-ae73e968532e.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls"></p>
<p>“Exploration” is also an important temperament of Souls-like games. The complex, grand, and mysterious things in Souls-like games make players instinctively want to pursue them. The fragmented narrative reveals the tip of the iceberg of the grand world, and the complex, hidden, and highly explorable map immerses players in this dark land. These designs encourage players to explore the world more carefully. In order to make the game more exploratory, Hidetaka Miyazaki has made a lot of information in the game fragmented, hidden, and complex. He does not want to give players too complete and clear things, but hopes that players will build their own world through their own exploration.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fd629b6b0-8465-45f6-8356-ff98287917bf.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls Map"></p>
<h3 id="Apocalyptic-Aesthetic-World-Atmosphere"><a href="#Apocalyptic-Aesthetic-World-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Apocalyptic Aesthetic World Atmosphere"></a>Apocalyptic Aesthetic World Atmosphere</h3><p>For Souls-like games, its soul figure Hidetaka Miyazaki has been committed to expressing an “apocalyptic aesthetic” in the game: depressing and vast nights, decadent and grand buildings, the ignition and extinguishing of flames, the cycle of life and death… This kind of grand, ethereal, and depressing elements frequently appear in Souls-like games, constituting a unique Souls-like world.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Ff5a0cbd1-9264-42d6-b085-dbc48266de29.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls"></p>
<p>This apocalyptic aesthetic not only creates a very impactful emotional atmosphere for players, but also rationalizes the core experience of Souls-like games - “difficulty” and “exploration”. In a dark apocalypse, extremely difficult environments are taken for granted, and obscure information and areas awaiting exploration are also in line with the depressing and mysterious atmosphere of the apocalypse.</p>

<h2 id="2-Making-Overcoming-Difficulties-Fun"><a href="#2-Making-Overcoming-Difficulties-Fun" class="headerlink" title="2. Making Overcoming Difficulties Fun"></a>2. Making Overcoming Difficulties Fun</h2><h3 id="Using-Negative-Emotions-to-Enhance-Positive-Experiences"><a href="#Using-Negative-Emotions-to-Enhance-Positive-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Using Negative Emotions to Enhance Positive Experiences"></a>Using Negative Emotions to Enhance Positive Experiences</h3><p>How to design the sense of accomplishment in the game? Souls-like games give the answer by catalyzing the unparalleled joy and satisfaction after the final victory with the negative emotions of repeated failures. In order to give players a stronger game experience, Souls-like games allow players to experience oppressive, anxious, frustrated, and other negative emotions in extremely difficult battles, and encourage players to overcome this difficulty, so as to obtain a stronger sense of accomplishment and glory. That is, by means of first suppressing and then raising, making the depression more depressing and the happiness more joyful.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F6ff44876-1847-47a1-ada1-da1a9216fac0.png/size/" alt="Achievement Feelings"></p>
<p>Although negative emotions can be a catalyst, they are ultimately an unpleasant experience for players. In order to prevent negative emotions from being too high and discouraging players, many skills need to be paid attention to in the design of negative emotions in the game to minimize their negative impact. For example, reward players when the enemy’s weaknesses are exposed to encourage them to continue the challenge. In <em>Sekiro</em>, there are usually ghost fire points very close to the boss battle to avoid repeatedly experiencing the boring process of running. High-difficulty bosses are usually isolated in a spacious area for players to concentrate on the battle.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fcdeb745e-d86f-402a-91a0-1e231a9f4f2d.gif/size/" alt="Sekiro"></p>
<h3 id="Easy-Operation-Threshold-and-High-Difficulty-Enemy-Design"><a href="#Easy-Operation-Threshold-and-High-Difficulty-Enemy-Design" class="headerlink" title="Easy Operation Threshold and High-Difficulty Enemy Design"></a>Easy Operation Threshold and High-Difficulty Enemy Design</h3><p>Difficulty is an indelible feature of Souls-like games, giving Souls-like games a different kind of fun. This feeling of high difficulty does not come from complicated operations, but from enemy design.</p>
<p>Taking the <em>Dark Souls</em> series as an example, the basic operations of the game are not many. Simple four-direction movement and locking, attacks mainly use light attacks and heavy attacks, defense has blocking and parrying, dodging attacks has rolling, and switching weapons and magic. The core operations of most players are basically a combination of several common solutions, such as “slash + roll + counterattack”. Until <em>Elden Ring</em>, this easy-to-use operation logic is still very useful.</p>
<p>After the easy-to-use entry threshold, Souls-like games set extremely high-difficulty confrontations for players in the enemy design link. Souls-like games usually set a challenge with novel mechanisms and great difficulty. Usually, the game does not provide players with any clearance teaching. Players who want to overcome difficulties can only die and try repeatedly at the challenge until they master enough skills. Most of the boss enemies in <em>Sekiro</em> have unique fighting styles and novel attack methods. Players who face them for the first time hardly know how to defeat these bosses. Only through repeated death trials and errors can they improve their skills. This experience of learning how to fight in the death cycle is the essence of Souls-like games. Players repeatedly challenge the same difficulty, watching themselves progress step by step, producing wonderful chemical reactions emotionally, and bursting out with a surge of accomplishment when they finally overcome the challenge.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fd35f158f-cd70-4b2c-a744-cf09c62be0e8.gif/size/" alt="Sekiro Combat"></p>
<h2 id="3-Letting-Players-Breathe-in-Difficulty"><a href="#3-Letting-Players-Breathe-in-Difficulty" class="headerlink" title="3. Letting Players Breathe in Difficulty"></a>3. Letting Players Breathe in Difficulty</h2><p>According to the over-limit effect in psychology, there is an upper limit to a person’s tolerance for a certain emotion. If the player is in a depressed and frustrated mood in the game for a long time, and there is no [loose] rhythm control, then the player will feel very tired. Although difficulty is the soul of Souls-like games that cannot be separated, it is also necessary to set up a breathing space for players. By designing high-degree-of-freedom coping methods, players are helped to persevere in difficulties.</p>
<p>In the design of the difficulty curve, Souls-like games often give many opportunities to escape in the early and mid-term in order to allow players to learn to explore the enemy’s routines more smoothly and enter the challenge mode. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, this progress is more obvious. Players can ride a horse to escape a failed battle. If one road is too difficult, they can choose another.</p>
<p>In addition, players have a variety of challenge methods when attacking bosses, and even have particularly easy countermeasures. For example, the famous newcomer killer, The Pursuer, in <em>Dark Souls 2</em>, can be dealt with by rolling away from most of the attacks by hiding in the position where he holds the shield, or by escaping to his birthplace and shooting with a ballista. A variety of coping methods not only further enhance the strategy of the game, but also make the player’s perception of difficulty more flexible, further reducing the possibility of players being discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Hidetaka Miyazaki, the soul figure of Souls-like games, believes that death is not meaningless. The Souls-like games he produced are always full of the propositions of “death and rebirth”, “attempt and overcoming”. He insists on apocalyptic aesthetics and insists on using extremely difficult experiences to touch the hearts of the audience. Perhaps it is this special persistence that keeps Souls-like games very strong in this era. We also need to see what efforts Hidetaka Miyazaki has made behind this persistence in order to make the player experience more complete.</p>
