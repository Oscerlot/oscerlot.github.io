<p>The “Territory War” in games might remind people of national warfare at first glance. In this era that increasingly values personalization, exploration, creative fun, and the rise of the ACG (Anime, Comics, and Games) subculture, this type of gameplay sounds like something popular in the last decade. So, are people still interested in this kind of gameplay that emphasizes strong organization and weak individual play?</p>
<p>Territory War, or what everyone calls “national warfare,” is not a fixed concept. It is a general term for large-scale multiplayer online PK activities. In the early days, most of these types of gameplay used the “nation (server)&#x2F;city-state” in the game as the participating unit. Over time, “national warfare” has become synonymous with this type of gameplay.</p>
<p>In the current game market, such activities often appear in MMORPG games. Their manifestation is often in the form of guilds. Some games also have an alliance&#x2F;faction level above the guild, and they compete for territory&#x2F;land. Occupying territories of different levels will bring different rewards to their guilds and affiliated factions.</p>

The final reward content is generally high-value development props, or even gameplay-exclusive numerical props.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some games have multiple different attack and defense points in each area, and each point has offensive significance; some have only one battlefield in an area. Different games have different map designs and their corresponding point occupation rules. Relatively speaking, the fewer the battlefields, the more groups competing in a single battlefield, the higher the density of combat personnel on the same screen, and the more intense the battle.</p>

<p><em>In “Revelation M”, when the player’s guild attacks the Praying Temple, the attacked guild gathers and presses on the Zulong Seal platform, and nearly 300 people from both sides fight on the platform.</em></p>

<h3 id="The-guild-is-the-smallest-unit-of-participation"><a href="#The-guild-is-the-smallest-unit-of-participation" class="headerlink" title="The guild is the smallest unit of participation."></a>The guild is the smallest unit of participation.</h3><p>Territory War takes the guild as the smallest unit of participation. Individuals&#x2F;fixed teams and other smaller player units cannot participate. Some games also have an alliance&#x2F;faction level above the guild. The degree of reward sharing and reward value within the faction are different, which will affect the loose-tight organization of different guilds within the faction, which also creates different territory war ecologies.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, the smallest participating unit in the Territory War is the guild. Each guild must choose its own faction. Within the faction, they cannot attack each other or attack the territories they have occupied. The battle results between guilds in the faction are not shared. Instead, factions need to compete for faction rankings. The guild ranked first in the faction can become the alliance leader guild, and the alliance leader guild can receive an additional alliance leader guild reward (high value).</p>
<p>The degree of reward sharing among guilds in the same faction is not high, and there is also a competitive relationship for high-value rewards. Therefore, in <em>Revelation M</em>, there is often no atmosphere of sharing a common hatred within the same faction. The core of the game is still the ecology of expansion and competition with the guild as the unit. And there will not necessarily be mutual help within the same faction. In some cases, there will also be spies sent by enemy guilds within the faction (after the enemy robs the guild’s territory, the spies will plant flags. Because the territory of the same faction guild cannot be robbed, this method is used to encroach on the guild’s territory) .</p>

<h3 id="There-is-a-certain-tactical-space-not-only-requiring-combat-skills"><a href="#There-is-a-certain-tactical-space-not-only-requiring-combat-skills" class="headerlink" title="There is a certain tactical space, not only requiring combat skills."></a>There is a certain tactical space, not only requiring combat skills.</h3><p>Looking at the above two points alone, you may think that Territory War is to add guild units to the battlefield, or a PLUS version of the guild league with a larger map and allowing more people to participate. The difference in experience from these two is that Territory War has greater tactical space. Compared with ordinary team battles (leagues or wild team PK), it pays more attention to how to deploy troops. Due to the complex terrain and diverse mechanisms of Territory War, in addition to combat skills, it is also necessary to consider whether to choose feint attacks, lure the enemy, or other large-scale overall tactics.</p>
<p>Taking the <em>Revelation M</em> Territory War mechanism as an example, it may be easier for everyone to feel what this tactical space refers to.</p>
<p>[Map mechanism] There are a total of 3 large strongholds and 8 small strongholds in the gameplay. Each stronghold can accommodate up to 300 people from the same faction. After a player dies 6 times in a stronghold, he will be resurrected outside the stronghold. Specifically, each stronghold has its own running route. Different entrances, the location of the opponent’s large group, whether the Zulong Seal platform is currently stationed, predicting where the opponent may intercept our attack on the road, and how to divide the troops to outflank will also have different effects.</p>
<p>Take the large point of East Sea Barrier as an example. There are 4 entrances. There are 5 common attack routes, and each route has its own characteristics. For example, the back door has the shortest running distance to the platform, but from the back door to the Right Tower Square is a long slope. If the opponent charges from top to bottom, the large group here is likely to be directly killed 6 times by the opponent before gathering.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Overhead view of East Sea Barrier and the back door route of East Sea. It takes 1 minute to teleport from the back door to Zulong Seal. Successfully occupying the area means planting the guild’s Zulong Seal in the center</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Due to the running map and map restrictions, in the game, who is currently occupying each stronghold, whether their main force is stationed in the stronghold, which stronghold the guild chooses to attack, whether it is a small team stealing points or a large group pressing, whether it is violent output frontal pressure or tactical flanking raid Zulong Seal, predicting the number of resurrections of the opponent’s main force during the stalemate, etc., are all variables that need to be considered.</p>
<p>[Dispatch mechanism] In addition, the gameplay also has a matching dispatch mechanism, which allows tactics to play more tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanguard mechanism</strong>, the vanguard can transform into a mecha, and the mecha can greatly increase the damage of Zulong Seal, increasing the breakthrough power for stealing seals.</li>
<li><strong>Unified command mechanism</strong>, unified command can use the guild-wide map summoning skill to quickly gather all guild members around the unified command (skill CD is 5 minutes)</li>
<li><strong>Alliance leader mechanism</strong>, the guild with the highest guild contribution in the same faction will become the alliance leader guild, and the president can use the alliance leader skill to summon members of this faction to teleport to his side.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your guild is the alliance leader guild, then you have two mechanisms: unified command summoning and alliance leader summoning. At the same time, the actual commander of the Territory War does not need to be the unified command or the president. Therefore, in actual combat, it is often the commander who contacts the scouts on a single line, and according to the intelligence given by the scouts, contacts the current person in charge of unified command and president on a single line, and asks them to hide in a certain position in the stronghold according to the situation, and pull the summoning at a critical moment to carry out a surprise attack. Here, there can be N kinds of strategy combinations.</p>

This sense of game allows players to deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.”"></a>Tactical space gives players a high degree of freedom in strategic experience. This sense of game allows players to deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.”</h3><p>Next, I will review a Territory War that I once watched, which may make everyone feel the high degree of freedom in the Territory War.</p>
<p>In this battle, the UP master was at a disadvantage. The combat power level of both sides can be roughly understood as: enemy guild &gt; our guild (the UP master’s guild is hereinafter referred to as “our side”) &gt; enemy’s second guild. Since a guild can only occupy one large point, there are 10 minutes left before the end of the Territory War at this time. The enemy guild and the enemy’s second guild are in the same faction, each occupying a large point. Previously, our guild had launched attacks on both large points, but they were defeated by the enemy’s large group and could not be captured. Our commander speculated that the enemy should adopt a guaranteed tactic and leave a summoner in both large points. Based on this speculation, our commander started a feint in the last 10 minutes.</p>
<p>① Our side pretended to give up the large point and gathered a large group to attack the small point, attracting some of the opponent’s main force to interfere, deliberately receiving the summon in front of the opponent, so that the opponent found that we were going to sneak attack the Praying Temple.</p>
<p>② According to the terrain characteristics of the Praying Temple’s long tunnel, our commander predicted that the opponent would pull the order back to defend after being attacked. As expected, the enemy urgently pulled the summon back to defend, successfully defrauding the opponent’s summon CD here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Fb4ae153d-c641-4739-b1cc-f5fe3324c1cf.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;b4ae153d-c641-4739-b1cc-f5fe3324c1cf.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Overhead view of the Praying Temple, the tunnel is long, and it takes about 2-3 minutes to actually run to the center point</em></p>
<hr>
<p>③ Our commander asked everyone to switch to the back door of East Sea Barrier, and used the advantage of the back door of East Sea Barrier to run to the location, quickly pushing to the place where Zulong Seal was located, deceiving the opponent’s large group to leave the Praying Temple.</p>
<p>④ At this time, there were 4 minutes left before the end of the Territory War. Our side once again pulled the summon next to the Zulong Seal of the Praying Temple. Using the time difference that the opponent’s large group needed to run through the tunnel to defend, the occupation of the Praying Temple was completed. At this time, the activity was nearing its end, and it was too late for the opponent to arrive and destroy our Zulong Seal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F5be17657-aab2-4e32-85e1-8e0b2b85ca51.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;5be17657-aab2-4e32-85e1-8e0b2b85ca51.png"></p>
<p>Under the multi-layered operation of the commander, the UP master side completed the reversal of winning more with less when the overall strength was weaker than the opponent. Compared with leagues and large group battles, the unique tactical space of Territory War can provide a high degree of freedom in strategic experience. This sense of game also makes players deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.” Of course, this also requires higher capabilities of the Territory War commander. If the command is not good and the tactics are not good, many players feel that they “don’t know what they are doing throughout the whole process.”</p>

Members with special tasks contact the commander privately by voice and private messages, and members without special tasks receive unified dispatch. The premise that tactics can be implemented well and played beautifully is the cooperation between various units, which is obedience and efficient response to each player.</p>

<p>In actual Territory War, because there will always be undercover agents mixed in the group to inquire about information, the commander will hardly tell everyone the overall tactics on the microphone, nor will he reveal the analysis in his mind. He will only give clear instructions on what to do at present according to the current judgment. This kind of high-confrontation pressure situation will make all participants unconsciously and actively obey the instructions, not question the received instructions, but just try their best to execute them. In this process, players with a high degree of cooperation will automatically internalize the goals of the commander&#x2F;guild management into one of their own goals for participating in the activity. In addition to relying on social interaction, common interests, and common experiences to unite team members, the guild also adds a strong buff of “common goals.”</p>
<p>“Everyone has their own tasks” allows players to confirm that they are part of the organization. “High obedience in confrontational pressure situations” weakens players’ self-perception. The two interact with each other, allowing players to consciously or unconsciously form “common goals” with the collective. The three together strengthen players’ sense of belonging to the collective. In this process, players strive to achieve common goals, make contributions, and even make some sacrifices (investing more time and money) also make them feel their moral emotions of fulfilling obligations, making contributions, and striving for honor for the collective, which is what we often call collective honor.</p>

Will Young Players Still be Interested in this Old-fashioned Gameplay?</h2><p>High strategy and militarized participation experience, these features that sound both heavy and impersonal, are indeed significantly different from the fun of self-expression, creation, and exploration that young people pursue, which is often mentioned in mainstream media. However, in actual research, we found that although the age distribution of players who like team battles is indeed older than that of players who prefer exploration&#x2F;high degree of freedom, if you look at the proportion, there are still many young players who are interested in team battles.</p>

<p><em>In a certain survey of a certain game, the distribution of players who claimed to like large-scale team battle PK, competitive operations, and exploration.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We found something when doing related research. Many players who like Territory War are not interested in this kind of large-scale team battle at first. The less intuitive fun brought by this complex mechanism often makes them feel good after experiencing it. After experiencing intense, difficult, or reversed team battles, new players experience high-energy moments with clear goals and intense battles. In order to repeat this high-energy experience, they may gradually develop a preference for team battles. We speculate that it is very likely that the fun experience of this type of gameplay is more difficult to experience and verify in life than the fun of plots, dressing up, and puzzle solving, which are relatively easy to feel and judge whether you like them in real life.</p>

<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Territory War is a form of large-scale team battle in MMORPG. Compared with regular team battles such as leagues, large-scale team battles such as Territory War have richer map mechanisms and dispatch mechanisms, bringing additional tactical space to the gameplay. It is this relatively rich tactical space that gives players differentiated fun content:</p>
<p>① The high degree of freedom in strategic experience allows players to deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.”</p>
<p>② The close cooperation of each participant in the gameplay to complete a goal allows players to have a stronger sense of belonging and gives rise to a sense of collective honor.</p>
