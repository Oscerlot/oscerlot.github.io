<p>Questionnaire surveys are a commonly used research method in game user research, which can quickly collect data from a large sample. Although how to set up questions and how many questions to set in a questionnaire are determined by the research purpose, in general, questionnaire designers will control the number of questions to about twenty, and no more than thirty.</p>
<p>So, can a questionnaire with twenty items only provide twenty pieces of information? Of course not! Cross-analysis can allow a limited questionnaire to provide more information and play a greater role. From a purely mathematical point of view, two-by-two crossing of twenty questions can produce 380 results. How to use so many crosses? How to use meaningful cross-analysis in game user research to deeply understand players?</p>
<p>This article will briefly introduce what cross-analysis is and its application significance, and show how to do cross-analysis in game user research.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Cross-Analysis"><a href="#1-What-is-Cross-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Cross-Analysis?"></a>1. What is Cross-Analysis?</h2><p>Cross-analysis is a basic data analysis method used to analyze the relationship between two variables. This analysis method crosses two or more indicators to find the relationship between variables and discover more data characteristics.</p>
<p>The following uses an example to briefly explain what cross-analysis is.</p>
<p>There are two questions in the in-game questionnaire of a certain game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>① Based on your recent game experience, what is your satisfaction with the game?<br>a. Very dissatisfied<br>b. Relatively dissatisfied<br>c. Neutral<br>d. Relatively satisfied<br>e. Very satisfied</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>② What is your gender?<br>a. Male<br>b. Female</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A total of 200 questionnaires were collected, and the results of data statistics for each question are as follows (non-real data, not statistically significant):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Question</th>
<th align="left">Option 1</th>
<th align="left">Option 2</th>

<th align="left">Option 4</th>

<td align="left">Satisfaction with the game</td>
<td align="left">Very Dissat.</td>
<td align="left">Relatively Dissat.</td>
<td align="left">Neutral</td>
<td align="left">Relatively Sat.</td>
<td align="left">Very Satisfied</td>
<td align="left"></td>

<td align="left">105</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">200</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>At this time, the results we can see from the data analysis are that the ratio of men to women in the game is close to 1:1, and the overall satisfaction is more than dissatisfaction. The cross-analysis result is obtained by crossing the two variables of gender and satisfaction, which is an analysis that combines these two variables.</p>

<h2 id="2-The-Significance-of-Cross-Analysis-from-the-Perspective-of-“Simpson’s-Paradox”"><a href="#2-The-Significance-of-Cross-Analysis-from-the-Perspective-of-“Simpson’s-Paradox”" class="headerlink" title="2. The Significance of Cross-Analysis from the Perspective of “Simpson’s Paradox”"></a>2. The Significance of Cross-Analysis from the Perspective of “Simpson’s Paradox”</h2><p>It is not difficult to find the significance of cross-analysis from the above case. The analysis of only single variables will lead to the conclusion that players are more satisfied than dissatisfied with the game, but after cross-analysis, it will be found that male players and female players have completely different evaluations of the game. Most male players are generally dissatisfied with the game, while the positive emotions of female players have pulled up the overall satisfaction level.</p>
<p>The significance of cross-analysis is that through this analysis method, it is possible to more clearly understand the views of different types of players&#x2F;users on the game&#x2F;product, and prevent the excessive integration of data from masking and losing real data.</p>
<p>The so-called masking and loss of real data can be more clearly perceived through “Simpson’s Paradox”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F72d9cc0b-6eb6-4ae5-9a87-7eb27a0be1eb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;72d9cc0b-6eb6-4ae5-9a87-7eb27a0be1eb.png"></p>
<p>We encountered “Simpson’s Paradox” when analyzing the payment rate of a certain game’s gameplay. (The following data is not real data) In this game, the payment rate of scenery-oriented players in the overall gameplay is much higher than that of appearance-oriented players, the former is 44%, and the latter is only 28%. Before concluding that “scenery-oriented players are more willing to pay in gameplay than appearance-oriented players”, we found that the payment rate of appearance-oriented players in the two gameplays that make up the game - gameplay A and gameplay B - is higher than that of scenery-oriented players.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left"></th>
<th align="left">Gameplay A</th>
<th align="left">Gameplay B</th>
<th align="left">Overall</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Scenery</td>
<td align="left">53%</td>
<td align="left">10%</td>
<td align="left">44%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Appearance</td>
<td align="left">80%</td>
<td align="left">15%</td>
<td align="left">28%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In gameplay A, the payment rate of appearance-oriented players is 80%, which is higher than that of scenery-oriented players, which is 53%; similarly, in gameplay B, the payment rate of appearance-oriented players, 15%, is higher than that of scenery-oriented players, 10%. However, in the overall gameplay payment of the game, the payment rate of scenery-oriented players is almost twice that of appearance-oriented players.</p>
<p>This is a typical “Simpson’s Paradox”, where the overall trend is completely opposite to the classified trend. Why does this happen? Because from the perspective of sub-gameplay, the payment rate of gameplay A is very high (58%) and the payment rate of gameplay B is very low (14%). In this case, a large number of scenery-oriented players participated in gameplay A, while a large number of appearance-oriented players participated in gameplay B. The overall trend that does not distinguish between gameplays loses the connotation of the data and pushes the overall explanation to the other extreme.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Do-Cross-Analysis-in-Game-User-Research"><a href="#3-How-to-Do-Cross-Analysis-in-Game-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Do Cross-Analysis in Game User Research?"></a>3. How to Do Cross-Analysis in Game User Research?</h2><p>Theoretically, any two variables can be crossed, and a questionnaire can get hundreds of cross-relationships, but many cross-relationships have no practical significance. In the questionnaire analysis of game user research, if you want to conduct cross-analysis, the core is actually to classify players according to different standards, and then analyze the data of different types of players. Therefore, the core of cross-analysis in game user research is how to classify players.</p>
<p>Combining the characteristics of game players and data, this article divides the cross-analysis classification methods of game questionnaires into three categories.</p>
<h3 id="Cross-Analysis-Based-on-Demographics"><a href="#Cross-Analysis-Based-on-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="Cross-Analysis Based on Demographics"></a>Cross-Analysis Based on Demographics</h3><p>Classifying players based on demographics is the most common way. Demographic information includes gender, age, income, occupation, region, etc.</p>
<p>Most questionnaires will collect demographic questions at the end, and game research questionnaires are no exception. After collecting the questionnaire, conduct data analysis, gender ratio, age segment, but demographic information provides far more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F6a8da674-d7f7-4da6-819d-d023db967753.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;6a8da674-d7f7-4da6-819d-d023db967753.png"></p>
<p>How do we use demographic information for cross-analysis in games? Gender is the most widely used in game questionnaire cross-analysis. Male players and female players show different attitudes in the choice of game types, preferences for game art styles, and pursuit of game fun. For example, in a questionnaire analysis, after classifying players by gender, it can be seen that female players pay special attention to the picture style and the pace of the game, while male players pay more attention to the game theme and the investment of money and time (ie, the cost-effectiveness of the game).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F4a819fbc-df90-4c3a-9ef7-a58e24b407d4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;4a819fbc-df90-4c3a-9ef7-a58e24b407d4.png"></p>
<p>When investigating the media channels that players are exposed to, through cross-analysis we found that girls prefer Weibo and Xiaohongshu, while boys relatively prefer live broadcast platforms. This discovery of media contact preference inspires us to what kind of materials our game marketing should produce and on which platforms to attract players (the data does not show all options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2Fb7bab50a-bbee-43fa-8392-8068bde4b9e6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;b7bab50a-bbee-43fa-8392-8068bde4b9e6.png"></p>
<p>Demographic factors such as players’ age and income are also often seen in the cross-analysis of game questionnaires, but factors such as region are not common. The reason is that factors such as region are largely related to the factor of income. Using these factors for classification may not reflect the differences caused by regional culture, but the overall economic level.</p>
<h3 id="Player-Classification-Questions-Designed-in-the-Questionnaire"><a href="#Player-Classification-Questions-Designed-in-the-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Player Classification Questions Designed in the Questionnaire"></a>Player Classification Questions Designed in the Questionnaire</h3><p>In addition to the “fixed setting” demographic questions in the questionnaire, questionnaire designers can also add meaningful player classification questions when designing the questionnaire, which is convenient for cross-analysis after collecting data. We once asked players about their gaming experience in the questionnaire as a basis for distinguishing players. By comparing the channels through which MMO mobile game players and two-dimensional mobile game players receive new game information, it can be seen that MMO mobile game players receive more customer service or pushes from game companies (the data does not show all options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F5e88e62f-0af5-4c68-8385-63dc57d24479.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;5e88e62f-0af5-4c68-8385-63dc57d24479.png"></p>
<p>In addition to the game experience background, we have also used multiple indicators such as player communication ability and player game level to classify players, and further analyze the attitudes of different types of players.</p>
<h3 id="Classify-Players-According-to-Their-In-Game-Data-After-Questionnaire-Collection"><a href="#Classify-Players-According-to-Their-In-Game-Data-After-Questionnaire-Collection" class="headerlink" title="Classify Players According to Their In-Game Data After Questionnaire Collection"></a>Classify Players According to Their In-Game Data After Questionnaire Collection</h3><p>The demographic information and pre-established player classification questions mentioned above are all based on the results of the questionnaire collection to classify players. In fact, we can also classify players according to their in-game level, school and other game-related data after the questionnaire is collected, to understand the situation of players of different levels&#x2F;schools filling out the questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="4-Common-Indicators-in-Cross-Analysis"><a href="#4-Common-Indicators-in-Cross-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="4. Common Indicators in Cross-Analysis"></a>4. Common Indicators in Cross-Analysis</h2><p>There are two common indicators in cross-analysis: row&#x2F;column percentage and TGI index.</p>
<h3 id="Row-Column-Percentage"><a href="#Row-Column-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="Row&#x2F;Column Percentage"></a>Row&#x2F;Column Percentage</h3><p>Still taking the cross-analysis of “gender × satisfaction” as an example:</p>

<p>When analyzing and calculating, choosing row percentage or column percentage mainly depends on whether the indicator has practical significance. In the crossing of some variables, both row&#x2F;column percentages have certain explanatory significance, but in the crossing of some variables, only one indicator is meaningful. As in the above case, the row percentage indicator reflects the difference in player satisfaction under gender differences, while the column percentage indicator has no practical significance.</p>
<h3 id="TGI-Index"><a href="#TGI-Index" class="headerlink" title="TGI Index"></a>TGI Index</h3><p>TGI stands for Target Group Index, which reflects the strength&#x2F;weakness of the target group within a specific range. TGI &#x3D; the proportion of the target group with a certain characteristic &#x2F; the proportion of the total population with the same characteristic * 100%.</p>
<p>When TGI &#x3D; 100%, it indicates that there is no difference between a certain characteristic group and the overall population;</p>
<p>When TGI &gt; 100%, it indicates that the group characteristics are stronger than the overall performance, and increase with the increase of the number;</p>
<p>When TGI &lt; 100%, it indicates that the group characteristics are weaker than the overall performance.</p>
<p>Taking the cross-analysis of “gender × media channel” as an example, the questionnaire asks players which platform they use more often, a short video platform or a live broadcast platform, and the results are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F5991ad12-babb-45aa-971a-2f6a2f621056.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;5991ad12-babb-45aa-971a-2f6a2f621056.png"></p>
<p>At this time, whether from the overall perspective or from the perspective of gender, players use the short video platform more often. Is this all the information we can get? The TGI results provide another piece of information:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Gender</th>
<th align="left">Short Video Platform TGI</th>
<th align="left">Live Broadcast Platform TGI</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Male</td>
<td align="left">86%</td>
<td align="left">143%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Female</td>
<td align="left">113%</td>
<td align="left">62%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Take 86% as an example, it is obtained by dividing 60% of male players choosing the short video platform by 70% of overall players choosing the short video platform. The TGI index tells us that, relative to the overall population, male players use live broadcast platforms more often, and female players use short video platforms more often. The TGI index reflects the preference of a certain group relative to the overall population, which provides another piece of information.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>In fact, there are many scenarios where we can use cross-analysis in the analysis process. Many people know what cross-analysis is, but don’t know how to use it in specific scenarios, especially in game data analysis. Therefore, after briefly introducing cross-analysis, this article uses “Simpson’s Paradox” to intuitively demonstrate the significance of cross-analysis, and then summarizes the commonly used player classification methods for cross-analysis in game user research, and finally introduces the practical indicators of cross-analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to cross-analysis, there are many other ways to analyze questionnaires. In analyzing questionnaires, not only being limited to statistics of questionnaire question results can make the questionnaire play a greater role.</p>
