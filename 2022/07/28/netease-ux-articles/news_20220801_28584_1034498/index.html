<h2 id="1-About-Puzzle-Games-and-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance"><a href="#1-About-Puzzle-Games-and-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="1. About Puzzle Games and Non-Textual Information Guidance"></a>1. About Puzzle Games and Non-Textual Information Guidance</h2><p>More than ten years ago, on a summer afternoon, in an era when smartphones were not yet popular, when I opened the 4399 webpage, ready to switch games with a large piece of watermelon, a game called the <em>Baby Escape</em> series came into my sight. I didn’t know that it would open the door to puzzle games.</p>
<p>After that, there were countless masterpieces under the label of “puzzle”, such as the <em>Rusty Lake</em> series with wonderful plots and hardcore puzzle elements, or <em>Gris</em> with a romantic and ethereal artistic atmosphere, or <em>Her Story</em> with novel and interesting interactive ideas. But whenever I mention puzzle games, I still can’t forget the small game I played on the webpage many years ago. In one brain hole after another, I played as a baby chasing food, going to heaven and earth, and finally came to a strange planet and became friends with a robot who loves nature. The charm of puzzle games is nothing more than this: set out with a goal, feel satisfied in solving one obstacle after another, and finally understand the meaning of this world and reach the end of the plot.</p>
<h3 id="Elements-of-Puzzle-Games"><a href="#Elements-of-Puzzle-Games" class="headerlink" title="Elements of Puzzle Games"></a>Elements of Puzzle Games</h3><p>Although the definition of puzzle games is very broad, so broad that many game producers believe that as long as some puzzle-solving gameplay is forcibly inserted into the game, a “puzzle” tag can be added after the work tag, and players who prefer puzzle games will be included in the user portrait range. However, this is not the case. Although puzzle-solving is a classic and versatile seasoning in games, it is mostly a side dish to exquisite meals, bringing higher playability to the game, but it also has its own unique design points.</p>
<p>From the perspective of experience design, we can disassemble the elements of a puzzle game as follows.</p>
<p>First is the purpose of the puzzle, that is, the task set by the puzzle for the player, and the player’s motivation to complete the puzzle. For example, in the first part of the <em>Baby Escape</em> series, the player plays a baby who enters a variety of scenes because he is chasing a squirrel that has snatched snacks. At this time, the player’s motivation or ultimate goal to complete the puzzle is to catch up with the squirrel and get the snacks back, and the task set by the puzzle at hand is to escape the current scene. In classic puzzle games with the theme of escape rooms, even without too much plot development, escaping from a closed room is a natural task and motivation, and this setting gives the puzzle solving a natural necessity. But to make a deep impression on players and make the game full of charm, it is necessary to form the player’s internal driving force with the worldview and storyline.</p>
<p>Then there are the metaphors contained in the puzzle itself and the shaping of the worldview.</p>
<p>The game form brings a new sense of immersion and multi-sensory experience, which complements the nature of the puzzle itself as a carrier of stories and metaphors, and together constitutes the charm of puzzle games. In the third part of <em>Baby Escape</em>, the baby comes to outer space in order to retrieve snacks, and accidentally discovers a robot planet enslaved by the Slime King. When solving puzzles in the robot’s spaceship, you can find that there are green plants and insect drawings on the portholes of the spaceship, which shows that the robots yearn for a life full of vitality and attach great importance to the ecology and environment. But when players come to the planet where the robots live, they find that it is desolate and silent. Perhaps their former home was as green as the earth, but it became desolate and dilapidated after being plundered and mined by the Slime King.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the player’s puzzle-solving process, which is where interaction designers and game designers shine. How to let players of different intelligence and different game experience maximize their thinking potential in the whole puzzle-solving process without getting stuck is also what designers need to do through the ingenuity of interaction design. The process of player puzzle solving can be summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-and-Unconscious-Design"><a href="#Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-and-Unconscious-Design" class="headerlink" title="Non-Textual Information Guidance and Unconscious Design"></a>Non-Textual Information Guidance and Unconscious Design</h3><p>When designers expect players to perform corresponding operations in the game, they often need appropriate guidance. The essence of puzzle games is “solving problems with unknown answers through known elements in the game”. This process requires players to understand the basic mechanism of the game, collect and process necessary information, and finally solve the corresponding puzzles. For a specific puzzle-solving path, different guidance methods bring completely different sense of achievement and immersion to players.</p>
<p>Although textual information guidance is clear and definite, when it appears in large quantities, the gameplay and immersion experience will inevitably be destroyed, and it may even give players a feeling of “you are teaching me to play games”. Non-textual information can often be well hidden in the game environment, integrated with the background setting, and allow players to naturally perform interactive behaviors. The essence of non-textual information guidance is similar to the “unconscious design” proposed by designer Naoto Fukasawa. He believes that design should pay attention to these unconscious behaviors and transform them into visible things, which can make the design more suitable for human behavior and can be operated intuitively.</p>
<h2 id="2-Design-Points-of-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-in-Various-Elements"><a href="#2-Design-Points-of-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-in-Various-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Design Points of Non-Textual Information Guidance in Various Elements"></a>2. Design Points of Non-Textual Information Guidance in Various Elements</h2><h3 id="Puzzle-Purpose-Design-of-Big-Goals-and-Small-Goals"><a href="#Puzzle-Purpose-Design-of-Big-Goals-and-Small-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle Purpose: Design of Big Goals and Small Goals"></a>Puzzle Purpose: Design of Big Goals and Small Goals</h3><p>Here, the big goal refers to what the puzzle is ultimately for, which is related to whether the player has sufficient motivation to complete the entire puzzle-solving process, and can keep track of their puzzle-solving progress at any time. For puzzle games with long-term processes, it is very important to let players perceive their game progress at any time, which is conducive to reducing the player’s psychology of giving up halfway in the game.</p>
<p>In the game <em>Gris</em>, at the beginning of the first playthrough, the statue collapses, the world loses its color and becomes gray, and Gris also loses the ability to sing. During the whole puzzle-solving adventure, the player gradually restores the world to life through continuous exploration. As the watercolor spreads between the sky and the plaster statue, the player’s heart is also filled with color. The game uses the acquisition of color to reflect the division between large levels and to hint at the progress towards the ending. While being shocked, players are also deeply attracted and driven by the change of color rhythm of this scene art.</p>
<p>The small goal refers to the task set by the puzzle in the current scene. Players in puzzle games often have questions such as “Who am I”, “Where am I”, and “What should I do”. Whether the goal can be clearly presented to the player largely determines the player’s game experience. When the puzzle lacks the guidance of the presentation of a small goal, players are likely to feel confused and get stuck.</p>
<p>There are many large-scale puzzles in <em>Gris</em>. When the overall presentation of the puzzle exceeds the screen limit, with the forced zooming out of the camera, the player can see the whole picture of the entire puzzle at the first time, so as to form an estimation and thinking about the puzzle-solving purpose and puzzle-solving path of the entire scene in their minds.</p>
<h3 id="The-Puzzle-Itself-High-Quality-Metaphor-of-Core-Gameplay"><a href="#The-Puzzle-Itself-High-Quality-Metaphor-of-Core-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="The Puzzle Itself: High-Quality Metaphor of Core Gameplay"></a>The Puzzle Itself: High-Quality Metaphor of Core Gameplay</h3><p>The puzzle of <em>Gorogoa</em> is mainly based on graphic interaction, and there are almost no readable words in the game. The Chinese translation of this game is “Picture World”, which tells the story of a little boy who discovers a beautiful and huge mysterious creature outside the window, and thus embarks on a journey to find this mysterious creature. The strongest experience that this game brings to players is different from the traditional puzzle-solving gameplay, but focuses on the interaction of picture frames and the dual meaning of the same picture, which also constitutes the basis of the game’s core gameplay and content performance.</p>
<p>The producer, Jason Roberts, felt the narrative tension of a single picture from the book “Fourteen Strange Pictures and Fourteen Stories”, and realized from the illustrations that multi-picture narratives can constitute a richer game world. So he set the core gameplay as the interaction of picture frames and the narrative presentation of multiple pictures.</p>
<p>Picture frames and multiple pictures carry very important meanings in the game.</p>
<p>When players first get started with this game, they will naturally superimpose, split, or splice picture frames. Each operation can bring unexpected surprises. The splicing of multiple pictures will naturally make players want to piece together different stories by adjusting their order, and the mystery brought by the picture frame will make players imagine things outside the picture frame and desire to escape from the picture frame. The dual meaning of objects, as the basis for the splicing of picture frames, fully embodies the key to “fantasy mysticism” and mobilizes players’ desire for knowledge from small objects to the big world. Under the design of this high-quality metaphor, all puzzles no longer seem to be deliberately designed by the designer, as if they are an organic part of that world.</p>
<h3 id="Puzzle-Solving-Process-How-to-Let-Players-Solve-Puzzles-Naturally"><a href="#Puzzle-Solving-Process-How-to-Let-Players-Solve-Puzzles-Naturally" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle-Solving Process: How to Let Players Solve Puzzles Naturally"></a>Puzzle-Solving Process: How to Let Players Solve Puzzles Naturally</h3><p>(1) Establishment of Common Sense and Rules</p>
<p>For puzzle games, the mechanism and methods of exploring the world and puzzles can be roughly divided into two types: special puzzle-solving rules and general puzzle-solving rules. For the former, they are generally special interaction methods designed by designers based on the story background of the game. For example, in the game <em>Carto</em>, the core of puzzle-solving throughout is the map mechanism similar to a jigsaw puzzle: the explorable area is a map block, and players can splice and rotate them at will, as long as the edges can be aligned. When a specific map combination is spelled out through plot hints, new maps or new plot characters will appear.</p>
<p>How to naturally establish the game’s puzzle-solving common sense and rules in the player’s mind is a very important part of experience design. In the opening plot animation of the game, the grandmother shows Carto how she manipulates the map to affect the actual terrain changes. While the grandmother is asleep, Carto accidentally puts the map blocks of clouds and the airship together. At this time, the wind surges, Carto is blown off the airship, and thus separates from her grandmother and begins her puzzle-solving adventure story. This plot not only explains the cause and effect of the adventure, the player’s motivation and purpose of solving puzzles (exploring the world and finding the grandmother), but also cleverly paves the way for the “rules” of this world: the map can be dragged and rotated, spliced with each other, and affect the real world.</p>
<p>(2) Player Inertia Guidance</p>
<p>For those general puzzle-solving methods in puzzle games, the learning cost of players can be reduced by adopting the rules in reality or the mental model of similar games. Just like being a frequent visitor to puzzle games, we know that those loose stones will definitely have hidden paths after being stepped on and broken, and as people who live in the three-dimensional world every day, we also know that we can jump to another platform with the help of the inertia of the rope swing. The rules of reality and the established gameplay of the game improve the rationality and predictability of the puzzles, so that the game will not have too strong a sense of fragmentation.</p>
<p>In the hospital level of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>, there is a very clever design that fits the background of the hospital: players enter a strange room, and from the X-ray film posted on the wall, they can know that they have come to a place similar to a hospital radiology department, and the key they need to find may be in the doll’s belly. Players need to drag the dolls one by one behind the X-ray machine, press the button, take X-rays for the dolls, and then take the doll with the key to the incinerator upstairs, burn the doll, and take out the key.</p>
<p>For players who understand the real-life rules of these items, the whole process can be easily understood without intentional guidance. For the designer, the introduction of new puzzle-solving gameplay does not increase the player’s learning cost, nor does it require too much additional guidance design, and it is cleverly combined with the story background, which is really the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>(3) Trial and Error and Misdirection</p>
<p>The guidance of puzzle games is not all positive. Interesting misdirection will sometimes make players look back at the details, explore unexpected puzzle-solving paths, and then slap their heads: “So that’s how it’s solved!”</p>
<p>The overall guidance design of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em> is very smooth. There are many scratches visible everywhere in the game, some are used to imply the trajectory of item movement, and some are used to prompt traps falling from the sky. Most players cannot react quickly when they encounter a trap for the first time, but after trial and error, players will find that the table in front of them has obvious scratches from the trap, and when players see similar scratches again, they will be more vigilant.</p>
<p>In the library area of the school level of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>, the chase battle with the teacher also cleverly uses the design of misdirection. When the player plays for the first time, he will pass through the library and try to go out from the side door. However, since the companion is captured at this time, the door that needs two people to push open cannot be pushed at this time. The game uses common sense to guide players to the seemingly openable door, but when the player is stuck at the door and can only let the long-necked teacher approach little by little, this inescapable horror fills the whole body, and I believe that no player will forget this death.</p>
<p>When the player plays for the second time, they will realize that they need to hide beside the door first, wait for the teacher to go out, and then drag the box with the help of the scratches on the floor, climb up and push open the door handle. The designer designed the misdirection point not to “punish the player”, but to make those players who do not carefully observe the scene make mistakes, so as to learn lessons and strengthen their cognition of common sense in the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Epilogue"><a href="#3-Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="3. Epilogue"></a>3. Epilogue</h2><p>Puzzle games are an interactive art. It needs to have natural interactive logic, a good emotional experience, and a pleasing aesthetic feeling. These three influence and achieve each other. When they are harmoniously unified, we can say that the design of this puzzle game is excellent. <em>Gorogoa</em>‘s author Roberts once asked himself: “What attracts me to puzzle games? I think it has something to do with the hidden structure or meaning of the world. The seemingly ordinary things in the world, if you can arrange and combine them in the right way, you can find some hidden structures. If you look at the world and don’t find any meaning, it means that you have to accept some challenges to find meaning.” And interaction designers are the people who secretly guide players to discover challenges, complete challenges, and finally piece together the secrets and meanings of the world.</p>
