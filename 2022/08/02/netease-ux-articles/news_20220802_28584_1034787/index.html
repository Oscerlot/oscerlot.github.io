</blockquote>
<p>Recently, India’s population exceeded 1.415 billion, surpassing China’s census figure of 1.412 billion (2021 census), making it the most populous country in the world.</p>
<p>India’s total land area is about 2.97 million square kilometers, only 30% of China’s. It is quite remarkable how India has achieved great economic growth in recent years, supporting a population of over 1.4 billion on its land. Fortunately, India has vast arable land, which it has developed into a world-class agricultural power. With the gradually developing economic conditions, the Indian people’s demand for entertainment and culture is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>Economic development has led to the rapid spread of communications and mobile terminals in the country.  In the first quarter of 2021, smartphone shipments in India increased by 23% to reach 38 million units; the overall smartphone penetration rate was 36.7%, with a user base of at least 502 million people. Although high-end models have not yet become mainstream, the Indian smartphone market has witnessed tremendous development in the past 5-6 years, one manifestation of which is that the RAM of mobile phones has increased at least 5 times compared with before, making the overall operating speed much faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2F62a4742a-92f4-4f6b-92ec-73f7f01a994d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;62a4742a-92f4-4f6b-92ec-73f7f01a994d.png"><br><em>Figure: Changes in the proportion of TOP smartphone manufacturers in India</em></p>
<p>Thanks to the rapid development of the smartphone industry and the low-cost system of 4G networks and data plans, many mobile phone users naturally began to come into contact with mobile games and become mobile game players. This article will mainly analyze the rapidly developing Indian game market in recent years from three aspects: the overall market, game players, and industry trends.</p>
<h2 id="1-Overall-Market"><a href="#1-Overall-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Overall Market"></a>1. Overall Market</h2><h3 id="“Fast-Speed-Large-Space”"><a href="#“Fast-Speed-Large-Space”" class="headerlink" title="“Fast Speed, Large Space”"></a>“Fast Speed, Large Space”</h3><p>According to a report on the Indian investment industry released by BCG and Sequoia Capital, in 2019 and 2020, the total Indian game market experienced a compound annual growth rate of at least 37% and 39%, and maintained a very good upward momentum. Its growth rate exceeded most of India’s media and culture sub-sectors, such as social media, video, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2F386d4f05-46ae-49f3-8a5d-a58bc4651ac6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;386d4f05-46ae-49f3-8a5d-a58bc4651ac6.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Analysis of Sub-modules of the Indian Entertainment Industry</em></p>
<p>We know that China surpassed the United States in 2020 to become the world’s largest game market. China and the United States have also occupied more than 40% of the global game market for many years. In India, according to 2020 data, the total revenue of the country’s game market accounted for only about 1% of the global market, and there is still huge room for growth. Especially in mobile games, the revenue of the Indian mobile game market exceeded 1.5 billion US dollars in 2020. Combined with its compound annual growth rate of at least 30%, this number is expected to exceed 5 billion US dollars by 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2F5c00b5d1-f1d8-42ba-9c9e-b2e15dd6f866.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;5c00b5d1-f1d8-42ba-9c9e-b2e15dd6f866.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Comparison of Game Markets in China, the United States, and India</em></p>
<p>If we turn our attention to the perspective of game commercialization, we can find that the Indian mobile game market is still in a very preliminary stage of development. Take PUBG Mobile as an example. The game’s downloads in the Indian market account for more than 25% of the global data, but the total revenue only accounts for less than 5%.  It seems that the overall growth space is huge. Why? High downloads, increased smartphone penetration, and advancements in terminal device performance all indicate that there are many Indians who can play games and who will play games, but they are still in the initial stage in terms of commercialization. By conducting more in-depth analysis of the Indian player group and doing more localization in terms of gameplay and art design, I believe there will be more opportunities waiting to be discovered. One piece of data also shows a clue, that is, from 2017 to 2020, at least 5-6 new mobile games will break into the TOP20 of the revenue list every year, which also means that the entire mobile game revenue TOP list is undergoing changes every year, and new opportunities and innovative categories are constantly emerging.</p>
<h2 id="2-Player-Situation"><a href="#2-Player-Situation" class="headerlink" title="2. Player Situation"></a>2. Player Situation</h2><h3 id="“Many-Mobile-Game-Players-Complex-Types”"><a href="#“Many-Mobile-Game-Players-Complex-Types”" class="headerlink" title="“Many Mobile Game Players, Complex Types”"></a>“Many Mobile Game Players, Complex Types”</h3><p>As an emerging game market, the Indian game market has developed tremendously with the popularization of smartphones. However, this also brings a result, that is, in India, the revenue brought by the mobile game market may account for more than 90% of the entire Indian game market. This data is a very astonishing proportion compared to China and the United States. Even in China, where the PC game market is shrinking severely, the proportion of revenue from mobile games is 76%, and this data is even smaller in the US market.  According to a survey, 90% of Indian game players also said that they prefer mobile games and are not inclined to PC and console games. This is a relatively obvious characteristic of Indian game players.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the continuous increase of players in the Indian game market, and the market in the country has experienced a leap-forward development, this has brought a very significant feature to the entire game industry. In China, whether it is game players or game developers, they start with simple and easy-to-use games, or games with relatively simple system structures, and gradually transition to the development and experience of more difficult and complex games. There is a very obvious learning curve in this. For the Indian game market and players, this learning curve is extremely steep.  Since the rapid popularization of smartphones in the country in 2016, it has been accompanied by a large number of excellent and complex mobile games imported from abroad. Most players have been exposed to games with complex systems, diverse gameplay, and very high completion from the beginning.</p>
<p>Driven by the rapid development of the global mobile game industry in recent years, combined with the slower development speed of local Indian developers, the demand of game players in the country has gradually reached a point where it cannot be continuously met. More and more players are beginning to pursue more unique and novel games. This can also be seen from the fact that 5-6 games in the TOP20 revenue list change every year.</p>
<p>At the same time, more and more Indian players are gradually developing into players with strong social attributes. This part of the players accounts for about half of all players. They prefer to play games with their friends or family, and regard games as a way of socializing. This feature can also be seen relatively clearly among Chinese mobile game players. Especially when some team games become popular, the social attributes of these games become very powerful. The demand of the Indian game market and player groups is also developing in this direction.</p>
<p>Specifically, players in the Indian market can be divided into the following categories: Try-and-See, Immersed, Game Enjoyers, Social, Status Seekers, and Hedonistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2Fbefc3aca-d2ca-494e-abae-c3e3acda746b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;befc3aca-d2ca-494e-abae-c3e3acda746b.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Six Types of Players in the Indian Mobile Game Market</em></p>
<p>How to understand these player classifications in the Indian game market? Let’s take a look at the explanations:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Try-and-See:</strong> These players like to use games to pass the boring time, and at the same time are very unwilling to miss various updates. The game types they prefer include casual games, board games and other light games, and they also have the shortest weekly game time.<br>(2) <strong>Immersed:</strong> These Indian players prefer games such as adventure games and casual games. They usually enjoy and immerse themselves in personal alone time. If they can play games during this time, they will be relatively satisfied.<br>(3) <strong>Game Enjoyers:</strong> These players enjoy several of their favorite games very much. These games are often mainly medium-to-heavy games, but their game time will not be too long.<br>(4) <strong>Social:</strong> Obviously, the characteristics of these players are prominent, that is, they will regard games as a social channel or means, and achieve the purpose of interacting with friends by playing games. So they basically don’t play games alone, but team up with friends, whether friends are online or offline.<br>(5) <strong>Status Seekers:</strong> Because gambling games are allowed in India, these players are relatively special. They are keen to achieve the purpose of making money in the game.<br>(6) <strong>Hedonistic:</strong> Most of these players are heavy game lovers. They will invest a lot of time every week, and often team up with online friends to play.</p>

Investment Trends and Company Analysis</h2><h3 id="“A-Lot-of-Financing-Funds-are-Coming”"><a href="#“A-Lot-of-Financing-Funds-are-Coming”" class="headerlink" title="“A Lot of Financing, Funds are Coming”"></a>“A Lot of Financing, Funds are Coming”</h3><p>BCG data shows that there were only 25 game developers in the Indian market in 2010, and by 2020, this number has achieved more than 10 times growth, with the number of game developers reaching more than 275. Some well-known European and American game manufacturers, including EA, Ubisoft, Zynga, etc., established branches in India in the early years, which also helped the Indian game development industry make significant progress to a certain extent. At the same time, many foreign game companies choose to publish games in India, which also indirectly promotes the prosperity of the Indian game development industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2Fa97b6cb3-ba85-4e9f-a1e4-07cbbaf1f13b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;a97b6cb3-ba85-4e9f-a1e4-07cbbaf1f13b.png"><br><em>Figure: Changes in the Number of Developers in the Indian Game Industry</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, many investment companies or the strategic departments of game giants have already taken a fancy to the Indian game market and have carried out a large number of investment and financing businesses in the market in the past 2-3 years. Data shows that from August 2020 to January 2021, in less than half a year, investment from all over the world in the Indian game industry reached 544 million US dollars.</p>
<p>The above is some analysis of the current situation of the Indian game market. We will also continue to track and analyze emerging markets including India, Brazil, the Middle East and other regions.  Stay tuned!</p>
