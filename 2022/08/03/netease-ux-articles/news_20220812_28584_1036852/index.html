<p>Games can immerse us in another world, providing completely different experiences and adding more entertainment to our original work and life. With the rapid development of the game market, players’ requirements for game quality are getting higher and higher, and they have increasingly higher standards in terms of plot, graphics, sound, and sense of immersion. This article will explore the importance of game voice acting and how to enhance the player’s game experience through good voice acting.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Importance-of-Localized-Voice-Acting-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-Importance-of-Localized-Voice-Acting-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance of Localized Voice Acting in Games"></a>1. The Importance of Localized Voice Acting in Games</h2><p>When you open a game, the most attractive things are the graphics, the character voices, and the feel of the controls. When players interact deeply with the game content using the characters in the game, the graphics and voice acting can instantly bring the players into the game world. Sound is the most perceptible element besides the graphics. As an important factor to enhance the player’s sense of immersion, game voice acting can shape the character’s personality in a variety of ways, while giving the character unique marks and emotional expressions, enhancing the fullness of the game character and the on-site experience.</p>
<p>In 2021, the multiplayer competitive game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, produced by NetEase’s 24 Entertainment, reached a peak of 121,513 online players on the first day of its global public beta on Steam. So far, global sales have exceeded 10 million copies, and it is sought after and loved by many players at home and abroad. Analyzing the reasons for the success of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> overseas, it can be seen that the game features that attract players and localization that meets the national conditions of various countries are indispensable. Among them, localized voice acting and lip-sync matching can provide players with a stronger sense of immersion and engagement.</p>

<h2 id="2-Why-is-Japanese-Voice-Acting-Popular-with-Players"><a href="#2-Why-is-Japanese-Voice-Acting-Popular-with-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is Japanese Voice Acting Popular with Players?"></a>2. Why is Japanese Voice Acting Popular with Players?</h2><p>Players around the world generally accept Japanese voice acting more than other languages. Why is this?</p>
<p>First of all, Japan has a large number of anime works, which makes its voice actor market relatively mature and standardized, and the whole process service is relatively complete and convenient. The level of Japanese voice actors is often the quality benchmark of the industry. Even if you don’t understand the language, you can still perceive all the subtle expressions, such as emotion, rhythm, and tone. With actions, even if you don’t understand Japanese dialogue, you still won’t be affected by understanding, so many players like to listen to Japanese voice acting even if they don’t understand Japanese.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are a large number of target groups around the world who like two-dimensional games, and they generally have a high acceptance of Japanese. I believe that most players who like to play two-dimensional style games are familiar with Japanese two-dimensional culture, and have a lot of contact with Japanese anime and games. Therefore, sometimes they are more accustomed to listening to Japanese voice acting than their native language.</p>
<p>In addition, some players also have their favorite Japanese voice actors. These Japanese voice actors can be promoted as highlights of the game, and can also increase the popularity of the game, which is a win-win for game manufacturers.</p>
<p>Here is a story about the voice acting of a very popular hero in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>
<p>Before the launch of the new hero Wuchen, Japanese players on social media accounts such as Twitter had very high calls for Hanae Natsuki. For netizens who are familiar with the two-dimensional field, they must have heard of the name of this popular voice actor. For example, the protagonist of the popular anime <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>, Kamado Tanjiro, and many other characters are voiced by him. Therefore, considering the high matching degree between Hanae and Wuchen, and in order to meet the needs of players to the greatest extent, the official decided to invite Hanae Natsuki to voice the role of Wuchen.</p>
<p>Whether it is the outstanding character design or the powerful ultimate skills, Wuchen has a very high appeal, and the discussion among Chinese and foreign players is good. On this basis, Wuchen’s voice is very outstanding, making this character widely welcomed by players, especially in the Japanese server, so that many domestic players want to transfer to the Japanese server to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fa7f205ad-6e96-4862-93d3-b7f2706eeb84.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;a7f205ad-6e96-4862-93d3-b7f2706eeb84.png"></p>
<p>Coincidentally, Hanae Natsuki himself is a well-known fan of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. He has broadcast live games with his friend Ono Kensho many times, and there are many netizens watching on the external network. He has also used his love to promote the game for free many times. Before Hanae was invited by the official, his other voice actor friend Ishikawa Kaito successfully got the Japanese voice acting of the hero Yueshan in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Hanae Natsuki also started the “comment mode” with great interest during the live broadcast, and expressed that he was very envious and hoped that he could have the opportunity.</p>
<p>When we invited him, he happened to be busy with the voice acting of other anime at that time, but as soon as he heard that it was the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, he immediately said that even if he had to work overtime on his days off, he would be Wuchen’s voice actor. In fact, it was not only him who was happy about the success of this cooperation, but the fans were also very happy, because Hanae Natsuki’s voice acting was indeed very exciting, and he perfectly interpreted Wuchen’s style. Many Japanese players said that they started to play the game because of Hanae’s voice acting. There are also many domestic netizens who are begging the official to add a voice adjustment function in the game.</p>

<h2 id="3-Why-is-the-Voice-Acting-of-Excellent-Games-Excellent"><a href="#3-Why-is-the-Voice-Acting-of-Excellent-Games-Excellent" class="headerlink" title="3. Why is the Voice Acting of Excellent Games Excellent?"></a>3. Why is the Voice Acting of Excellent Games Excellent?</h2><p>First of all, the voice acting of mature games has a very complete voice acting process, from script localization and polishing, voice actor selection (on-site casting), voice actor appointment schedule, inviting directors, planning and localization teams to observe and supervise online, to audio QA, etc., there are very strict quality controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fb3e8fa0d-6acb-48c0-9170-f05ddf455d19.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;b3e8fa0d-6acb-48c0-9170-f05ddf455d19.png"></p>
<p>The excellent voice acting is very strict when selecting voice actors, because good voice acting quality control can make players feel that the game is more fun. When choosing voice actors, many game companies will hire celebrities to do the voice acting, but can celebrity voice acting really improve the sense of immersion and game quality?</p>
<p>In fact, when we choose voice actors, the most important thing is not necessarily the popularity of the voice actor, but the fit between the character style and the voice actor. Does the voice actor’s voice and timbre match the character’s personality? Can it well reflect the character’s personality traits? In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, there are more than 10 heroes on the stage, and the age, personality and image of each character are completely different. The personalities of these heroes need to be embodied through appearance and sound. Therefore, when conducting localized voice acting, we pay the most attention to the degree of adaptation. If on this basis, the voice actor has both the characteristics of large traffic and explosive points, and can cooperate with marketing and publicity activities, that is the most perfect.</p>
<p>So what is the actual selection process like? The voice actors of the main game characters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are selected through the script of the characters actually appearing in the game. When casting, two or more voice actors are allowed to voice the same role, and then the voice actor who best fits the role is selected. Compared with casting from an existing voice actor resource pool, this method may require relatively more time and cost. The voice actors of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> have up to 3 interviews for each game character. When choosing voice actors, not only should we pay attention to the voice actor’s intonation, timbre, voice line, and acting style, but also consider the treatment of the ending of the word under the background of that era. For example, when doing Japanese voice acting, if it is a samurai’s line, the words will be adjusted according to the background of the time, and some ancient expressions will be used to reflect the era at that time, and at the same time, the ending of the speech will be adjusted to fit the world view. Similar processing is also required for Korean voice acting.</p>

<p>During the epidemic, because we could not supervise the studio on-site, we adopted a remote meeting that could share sound and script at the same time for online observation. During voice acting, we will invite colleagues from the planning, audio, and localization teams to check together. Very ideal results were achieved through systematic preparation beforehand. Although colleagues from the planning and audio groups may not understand the foreign language, they can give guidance on the character’s voice and timbre. Before recording, colleagues from the localization team will discuss the controversial content in the translated script, and sometimes they will work hard to find more natural and appropriate expressions. At the recording site, the localization colleagues will also control the voice actor’s interpretation of the lines, as well as the matching degree of the voice recording with the environment, character design, and line atmosphere, so as to improve the expressiveness of each word and each line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F6443a4ab-ffa2-44a2-a64c-a7e1944d1ffb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;6443a4ab-ffa2-44a2-a64c-a7e1944d1ffb.png"></p>
<p>After the audio recording is completed, there is one last step, which is the quality test (QA) of the audio. QA testers are the final quality controllers before the game works are presented to players. Our QA is responsible for identifying all critical issues, such as compliance, audio errors, CERO regulations (applicable to Japan) issues, and any issues related to the culture of the overseas region, to ensure that the launched product is free of any risks.</p>
<h2 id="4-Precautions-for-Voice-Acting-and-Processing-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#4-Precautions-for-Voice-Acting-and-Processing-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="4. Precautions for Voice Acting and Processing in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>4. Precautions for Voice Acting and Processing in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><p>Game voice acting is a professional project in which voice actors use their voices and words to portray and create various vivid character images with distinct personalities in front of the microphone. In this process, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of voice acting work and skills, and to create good works and improve the quality of voice acting in accordance with the artistic laws of voice acting work.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-Breathiness-and-How-to-Deal-with-It"><a href="#What-is-Breathiness-and-How-to-Deal-with-It" class="headerlink" title="What is Breathiness and How to Deal with It"></a>What is Breathiness and How to Deal with It</h3><p>Friends who are new to voice acting usually unconsciously ignore “breathiness”. They always think that voice acting mainly matches the dialogue, staring with wide eyes to find the lip shape, and dare not miss a single sentence or word. As a result, they do not notice the breath sound naturally produced by the actor when speaking. Sometimes, although the dialogue dubbed by the voice actor is very accurate, because the breath sound is lost, the dialogue sounds unnatural, and even feels stiff. Even if you already feel that you are very involved in the emotion, you still can’t feel the due atmosphere and tone. Some actors even like to speak with stuttering movements or breathy voices because of their personal performance habits, which makes the dubbing inaccurate.</p>
<p>In fact, “breath sound” is a very important part of voice acting. All the necessary breath sounds must be present, but none of the unnecessary breath sounds should be present.</p>
<p>How should we deal with “unnecessary breath sounds”?</p>
<p>First of all, when dubbing the dialogue, if the voice actor cannot use the “dantian” and only pronounces in the way of speaking normally, it is not only difficult to accurately match the mouth, but also easy to produce the sound of their own breathing, which is a noise and is to be NG.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the recording studio, you must always keep quiet and slow breathing, otherwise the sensitive microphone will pick up the sound of breathing like a bellows, which is naturally not allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, the breath sounds made in cooperation with the actor’s actions, such as chasing and running, carrying heavy objects, fighting, getting angry, etc., must clearly show the distance, time, space and other conditions on the screen, and more importantly, match the lip shape. Too much is also an “unnecessary breath sound”.</p>
<p>As an extremely critical part of voice acting, the rhythm of breath stop and continuation, length, strength, and tightness can all express the psychological rhythm of the character. In addition, “sound is produced when breath moves”, so “sound” is inseparable from breathing. The breathing matched with different words in different states is not the same, but there is no doubt that breath is a necessary condition for voice acting. Slight changes in mouth shape, breath sound resonance position, certain changes and control of the vocal cords and throat, and adjustment of tone, timbre and voice quality can all produce a voice different from your own. Coupled with the imitation of language style, it is not difficult to create a voice completely different from your own and become a new character role.</p>
<p>Voice acting needs to do a good job in the three aspects of emotion, voice, and breath, namely “emotion, voice, and breath”. Breath moves with emotion, and sound comes out with emotion. Breath is born from emotion and melts into sound. Voice actors should use their voices to interpret and interpret the characters, giving them souls and vitality; they should also convey information and communicate emotions with listeners. Therefore, in order to better convey emotions and ideas, voice actors need to have emotional color in their language. The perfect combination and flexible use of “emotion, voice, and breath” can improve the unity of freedom and controllability of voice acting, and present the spiritual connotation of the work itself to the greatest extent.</p>
<h3 id="Misunderstandings-Caused-by-the-McGurk-Effect"><a href="#Misunderstandings-Caused-by-the-McGurk-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Misunderstandings Caused by the McGurk Effect"></a>Misunderstandings Caused by the McGurk Effect</h3><p>The ears and eyes are our windows to observe the world. The ears “hear” things, and the eyes “see” things. They seem to be working independently and unconnected, but in fact they are connected. But many people don’t know that hearing and vision can also interfere with each other.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, in order to explore whether vision affects people’s speech perception, that is, whether vision affects hearing, psychologists Harry McGurk and John MacDonald of the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom did such an experiment: They found some adults to watch a video, in which the person’s lips made the sound of “ga”, but the dubbed sound was “ba”. As a result, 98% of the subjects said they heard the sound of “da”. This is caused by the mismatch between dubbing and lip shape. More precisely, it is due to the combined effect of vision and hearing, creating a third sound that does not exist - the “da” sound, which is the McGurk effect. What if it’s the other way around? The person in the video makes the sound of “ba” with their lips, but it is dubbed with “ga”. As a result, about 54% of the subjects heard “gabga” or “bagba”, and the McGurk effect is also obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5d7fe844-fdfa-4523-83ca-a2d5ca2c8726.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;5d7fe844-fdfa-4523-83ca-a2d5ca2c8726.jpg"></p>
<p>The McGurk effect shows that when the information received by vision and the information received by hearing are inconsistent, the intervention of visual information will affect the expression of auditory information, causing people to hear the wrong third sound.</p>

So how do we do it?</p>
<p>This is achieved by integrating AI technology to simplify complexity, based on algorithm automatic generation, successfully simplifying the original time-consuming and labor-intensive problem into content that can be perfectly output in a few days. This greatly saves labor costs and time costs, making the impossible possible. In addition to automatic adaptation, there is also a multi-language audio inspection function, which uses machines to ensure the accuracy of lip shapes. In addition, the lip-sync prediction controller data and batch replacement of lip-sync animation further improve the speed of outputting adapted lip-sync. This technology has been applied to multiple language versions of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and will continue to be applied to other overseas games.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Allowing players around the world to find happiness in the games they develop may be the dream of every game producer. With the improvement of global distribution channels and the maturity of technology, more and more games choose to be released globally. In the process of global distribution, game localization voice acting has become a very critical link. In order to allow players from different cultural backgrounds and different languages to understand the game well, voice acting needs to be as close as possible to the character positioning, lip movements, and story background in the game, with the intention of providing a more immersive game experience for global players.</p>
