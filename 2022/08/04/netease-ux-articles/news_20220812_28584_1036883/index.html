<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the expansion of the female gaming market, female-oriented dating sims have also become a battleground for major manufacturers. However, judging from the data, although there are many newly launched female-oriented dating mobile games, their market performance has declined very quickly. Taking five female-oriented mobile games of the two-dimensional and mixed styles launched in 2021 as an example, compared with the first month’s revenue, the revenue in March 2022 decreased by an average of 85%. It can be seen that not all games have truly touched female players. To provide players with an immersive dating experience and break through the homogenization of the category, it is inseparable from the research on the psychology of female players in dating games.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience"></a>1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience</h2><p>The main reason why dating games are so popular with players is that they create a highly immersive virtual world for players, where players are psychologically satisfied and unconsciously bring their fantasies and emotions from real life into the virtual game.</p>
<h3 id="Ideal-Self"><a href="#Ideal-Self" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Self"></a>Ideal Self</h3><p>In reality, we always have some dissatisfaction with ourselves. Sometimes we wish we could be more charming and successfully pursue the person we like; sometimes we wish we could be braver and say no to a black-hearted boss. The game world gives us such an opportunity to become our ideal self: you can become a popular figure in school, or you can firmly engage in the career you love.</p>
<p>For example, in the dating game <em>Starry☆Sky</em>, released in Japan years ago, the heroine Tsukiko Yahisa is set as the only girl in the school and serves as the secretary of the student council, and is sought after by many people. This slightly “Mary Sue” setting, although very different from real life, satisfies the player’s fantasy to a certain extent: good looks, loved by those around her, and also has the beautiful qualities of bravery and independence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/938ef26a-1e7f-42b6-ae5e-c7c12d0e3238.jpg"></p>
<p>Similar settings are also very common in domestic female-oriented dating games. In <em>For All Time</em>, the heroine is an excellent cartoonist who accidentally travels to the world of her own comics and adventures with familiar characters. During the game, the player obtains a new identity (cartoonist, etc.), and also develops a deeper understanding and identification with this identity as the story progresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/3aed829e-0443-4784-93ad-7c36906c808b.png"></p>
<p>From a psychological point of view, self-identity is formed by the interaction between the individual and the real world. However, in dating games, players can easily switch between real life and the virtual world to improve their self-identity. At the same time, the identity experience given to players by the virtual world is often far from the real self, but closer to the ideal self. Players can find a shadow of themselves in the game, and they long to be this character and accomplish many things that cannot be done in real life. In terms of appearance, the characters in the game have ideal figures and beautiful faces; in terms of personality, the fantasy plot like a novel, and the character’s strength and independence in the face of difficulties, are all their projections of the ideal self, satisfying the player’s need for self-worth realization.</p>
<h3 id="Deep-Seated-Motivation"><a href="#Deep-Seated-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Deep-Seated Motivation"></a>Deep-Seated Motivation</h3><p>Strong emotional experience is an important reason for immersion. Browsing the Weibo comments of dating games, we can always see players loudly confessing, “Please marry me quickly, don’t make me beg you on my knees”, “Husband, how can I live without you”, this kind of emotional experience is actually strongly related to the player’s game motivation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/7916d6f8-d8f1-4b78-ac6d-77c22b11c281.png"></p>
<p>After conducting a questionnaire survey of 612 female-oriented game players and semi-structured interviews with 15 players, researchers found that for positive emotions, external motivation (game sound, picture, plot, color) has a greater impact than internal motivation (social interaction, entertainment, learning, etc.). Both motivations have a significant positive correlation with positive emotions. The stronger the motivation, the more obvious the player’s positive emotional experience of the game. In contrast, for negative emotions, the stronger the external motivation, the lower the negative emotions; the stronger the internal motivation, the higher the negative emotions.</p>
<p>Specifically, if we see a player on the forum who is angry, anxious, and frustrated because of a female-oriented game, she is more likely to be an intrinsically motivated player who prefers to gain knowledge, relieve stress, make friends, and enjoy the pleasure of completing achievements through the game. And if it is a player who feels happy and satisfied in the game, then he may be driven by both internal and external motivations. He not only likes to gain knowledge and relieve stress through the game, but also appreciates the game’s graphics, art, music and other designs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/b6ae9394-b8f9-4625-ac5a-ee35e0a8ecd7.png"></p>
<p>Therefore, it is also worth paying attention to by industry professionals to better awaken players’ motivation to play during the operation stage.</p>
<h3 id="Flow-Theory"><a href="#Flow-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Flow Theory"></a>Flow Theory</h3><p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as a feeling of total engagement in an activity. Flow is often accompanied by high excitement and fulfillment. Activities that produce a flow state often have the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Activities we tend to engage in</li>
<li>Activities we will focus on</li>
<li>Activities with clear goals</li>
<li>Activities with immediate feedback</li>
<li>We have a sense of control over this activity</li>
<li>Our worries disappear when engaging in the activity</li>
<li>Subjective sense of time changes - for example, you can engage in a long time without feeling the passage of tim.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/25174532-0794-4b05-9c5e-a3048d6f864d.png"></p>
<p>In dating games, players often feel the passage of time without noticing it because they appreciate the handsome cards and charming voices of NPCs. This state is the flow state in psychology.</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding the conditions for the generation of the flow state, designing the game accordingly, and enabling players to achieve the flow state in the game is also an important step in creating an immersive experience.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?"></a>2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?</h2><p>So, after understanding the player’s psychological mechanism, how should game developers build this immersive experience?</p>
<h3 id="Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth"><a href="#Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Focus on Player Self-Worth"></a>Focus on Player Self-Worth</h3><p>Aggregate and analyze big data before game production, and put game settings that meet the psychological needs of modern women into the game, for example, players can independently choose “dating objects” and will also have a unique identity to realize self-worth. During the game, players invisibly feel the cultural content it contains - women’s freedom of marriage, economic independence, etc.</p>
<p>Such female-oriented games act as disseminators of feminist culture, returning the feminist ideas obtained from big data analysis to the target users, forming a cultural dissemination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/06a9466c-d703-4f11-bf88-e749be665415.png"></p>
<h3 id="Awaken-Player-Motivation"><a href="#Awaken-Player-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Awaken Player Motivation"></a>Awaken Player Motivation</h3><p>In terms of awakening external motivation, excellent graphics and well-known voice acting teams are great bonuses. In addition, female-oriented games can focus more on male NPCs in the setting of scenes. Even if there are scenes where the heroine appears, the heroine is also popularized from the characteristics, so that more players can substitute themselves. This type of game also does its best to create this first-person perspective in the text, and rarely personalizes the heroine. Even in some games, the heroine has different personalities when facing different male NPCs.</p>
<p>Such an “unconscious” shaping of female characters makes the same plot a unique personal “experience” for the player, that is, through the different psychological experiences of the player, the game becomes personalized and customized. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/513188f3-5fc7-48a4-9f11-9bed16508803.png"></p>
<p>In addition to awakening external motivation, designers can also start from awakening internal motivation to make female users feel “empathy”. For example, in <em>For All Time</em>, players can interact with NPCs using virtual messages. In addition, sending emojis, making phone calls, dating, and other behaviors add a strong “sense of reality” to the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/4b069842-17f0-4062-9562-b648f065947b.png"></p>
<h3 id="Create-a-Flow-State"><a href="#Create-a-Flow-State" class="headerlink" title="Create a Flow State"></a>Create a Flow State</h3><p>For players to truly enjoy the game, they need to fully substitute themselves into the game characters and participate in the game. When they are fully immersed in it, they will temporarily forget the current time and space and enter the world presented by the game, that is, reach a flow state. In dating games, some clever designs can also help create a flow experience:</p>
<p>In terms of goal setting, improve the player’s clarity of goals and control over the game. For example, the illustration system can help players clearly understand what their goals are and how many achievements they have achieved now. Ungained card sets can also prompt players what else they can do to better achieve their goals and improve their sense of control over the game.</p>
<p>In terms of emotional design, dialogue and voice acting are used to assist in the shaping of characters and the experience of the plot. For example, voice acting is not only reflected in the dialogue in the plot, but also used in various aspects of the player experience, such as the New Year greetings on the login interface, the statements around the birthday theme on the event interface, etc., incorporating emotions into the peripheral systems, making the immersive experience more integrated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220812/ce3ebeec-13ba-4045-8264-41ba5eb336a0.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In general, there are still infinite possibilities for the research on the immersion of female-oriented games: VR technology makes lovers within reach; the metaverse completely connects the real world and the online world; high technology may allow players to truly embrace “paper people” in the future. Gradually upgrading the immersive experience is also the common expectation of players and designers.</p>
