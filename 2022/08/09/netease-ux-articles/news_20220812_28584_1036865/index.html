<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the rise of the metaverse, concepts such as virtual avatars and virtual social interaction have also become popular terms. In fact, avatars and virtual social interaction are not new concepts in games.</p>
<p>The word “avatar” comes from Sanskrit and means “a god appearing on earth in physical form.” In games, players are the “gods” who control the fate of their characters.</p>
<p>Thanks to the innate emotional talent of human beings, we can always easily “project” our physical and psychological conditions onto other things. The construction and identification of avatars in games are often a mapping of players’ self-awareness or desires. This strong personal characteristic is the basis for establishing social interactions and attracting others. Conversely, social interaction stems from players’ needs for emotion and belonging, and is an external manifestation of players’ higher-level psychological needs. Therefore, this mapping relationship will also have corresponding requirements for the design of the avatar. This article will explore the design possibilities of virtual avatars from the perspective of players’ psychological needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification"></a>1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification</h2><p>Game social interaction stems from players’ pursuit of a sense of identity and belonging. In order to meet this demand, the primary task is to enhance players’ empowerment and identification with their avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Self-empowerment:</strong> Believing that you have the power to control your own life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avatar identification:</strong> A psychological phenomenon in which an individual’s self-perception changes temporarily during the process of using and experiencing a game avatar, and the emotional and cognitive connection with the avatar is strengthened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization"><a href="#Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization"></a>Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization</h3><p><em>“An ideal avatar carries the player’s aesthetics, taste, and personal pursuits.”</em></p>
<p>Similar to social interaction in our real lives, our first impression of a person is often based on their physical characteristics, such as height, weight, skin color, hairstyle, etc., and then we further understand their identity, occupation, interests, and other aspects.</p>
<p>In games, how can players have the same emotional experience with virtual character images as in real social interactions, as opposed to ordinary NPCs? Sufficient identity recognition is essential. When the player’s identity characteristics are fully recognized, the player’s social window is truly opened. For example, the most basic: name, gender, identity, skills, dynamics, social relationship information, and so on. </p>

<p><em>Diagram: Four types of information for avatar construction and mapping</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As shown in the figure above, we can divide the information that players give to virtual characters into four categories. Among them, basic information, characteristic information, and image design often give players the freedom to design themselves, encouraging players to create identity characteristics, and allowing players to gradually establish familiarity and ownership of the avatar.</p>
<p>In MMO games such as <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the first thing players perceive is the character creation system, which allows players to immediately immerse themselves in character design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5b75b6b4-e3a4-4dd8-bb45-e19358009b89.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>Character customization is also a major gameplay element, but not all players have proficient character customization skills. Many games, in order to allow players to experience more fun in character customization, will refine the operation of character customization, enrich the styles of different face shapes and makeup, and ensure that the characters created by players can satisfy themselves. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has hundreds of character customization materials, allowing players to create their favorite styles and shapes as they wish. Some players even have great ideas and create many funny images. </p>

<p>In addition, in the process of image design, surrounding elements such as environment and props can also be used to present personal interests and tastes, which not only enhances the personal attributes of the player’s character, but also provides a basis for the extensibility of design and the sustainability of social interaction in the game. </p>

<p>Unlike ideal avatars, blank avatars prefer relatively symbolic characters. American cartoonist Scott McCloud put forward an interesting point in his book “Understanding Comics”: the fewer details a character has, the more likely the reader is to project himself into that character. When players combine a symbolic character with a meticulously described world, they can generate a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, the player’s avatar often appears in a minimalist form. The game enhances the player’s sense of immersion through the design of the environment and sound. The blank space of imagination and the atmosphere rendering of the environment—this strong contrast enhances the player’s self-empowerment and identification with the avatar, ignoring the difference between the “avatar character” and themselves. </p>

The Process of Social Interaction: Self-Presentation and Group Identification"></a>2. The Process of Social Interaction: Self-Presentation and Group Identification</h2><h3 id="Frontstage-Self-Presentation"><a href="#Frontstage-Self-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Frontstage Self-Presentation"></a>Frontstage Self-Presentation</h3><p>“Frontstage” refers to the part of an individual’s performance that regularly defines the situation for the observer in a general and fixed way. The frontstage is where the avatar is concentrated, and it is the self-presentation where self-characteristics match character characteristics.</p>
<p>Players can present themselves through interactive designs in the game, enrich the character characteristics of the avatar, and attract the attention and recognition of other players.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-Interaction-Design"><a href="#Avatar-Interaction-Design" class="headerlink" title="Avatar Interaction Design"></a>Avatar Interaction Design</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Daily interaction:</strong> Give the avatar character traits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactive design and script design of the avatar itself, such as sound, dialogue, and actions, are important elements that help players achieve self-presentation during group interactions. In addition, real-time interactions such as text, likes, comments, voice, emoticons, and gifts can help players enrich their own character settings during social interactions, and enhance the fun and richness of social interactions.</p>
<p>The chat system of <em>Revelation Mobile</em> is similar to social software in real life. Players can use personalized chat methods and display their personality in real time through text, emoticons, voice and other chat tools, making the personality image of the avatar more vivid and three-dimensional. In addition, designs such as colored text and text shortcuts in the game make this chat tool more playable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Feead76b1-866b-404a-b3ae-49ecf3cb203b.jpg.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5a6a2a81-af84-4c09-8cd0-dbdf9e924ffe.jpg/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest interaction:</strong> Show personal hobbies and specialties</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the player’s voice and various music-based gameplays are distinctive features that run throughout the game. This kind of interest interaction fully demonstrates the player’s self-characteristics and integrates personal characteristics into the role, and also provides the possibility of expanding social scenarios. For example, the tea room is designed based on the players’ common interest in music. In addition to exploring the love of music, traditional culture, painting hobbies, etc. can also be integrated into the game to strengthen the interactive design of the avatar. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F7f648d3a-6ac1-49ca-9a36-07c47699cdae.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Music social interaction in “Revelation Mobile”</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action interaction:</strong> Cultivate avatar behavior habits</li>
</ul>
<p>Encouraging players to use the avatar’s actions to develop behavioral habits is also an important factor in the interaction between players. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, there are many tasks that require players to use emotional actions on NPCs, such as encouraging, comforting, and touching NPCs. This process will continue to strengthen the player’s positive emotions. Since there are many such tasks, players will naturally get used to putting commonly used emotional actions on the shortcut bar. In this way, the threshold for interacting with other players is also very low. After everyone finishes the dungeon and meets acquaintances in the wild, they will easily make a gesture to say hello, which is much more convenient than typing in the chat box. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional interaction:</strong> Enhance the emotional characteristics of the avatar</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players help each other to present themselves step by step through cognition and emotional progression, and gradually deepen their connection with each other. For example, by lighting the candles of other players’ avatars, they will change from small gray people to a state with a special decoration—this is the first step in interacting with people; further, players can also give nicknames to other players to deepen their memory of each other, and so on. </p>

<h3 id="Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification"><a href="#Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification" class="headerlink" title="Group Interaction and Group Identification"></a>Group Interaction and Group Identification</h3><p>Group identification is the process of classifying people or things, emphasizing common destiny, common goals, common emotions, and the interdependence of group members. The construction of group identification is mainly completed in the process of intra-group and inter-group interactions.</p>
<p>The essence of game social interaction is to achieve the goal of group interaction and group identification through joint participation. In games, ultra-temporal connections provide a situational basis for players to participate together, without considering the distance of reality. Players generate emotions due to their common love, making members naturally form a psychological feeling of “being together” or “being one of us”. Group interaction and group identification require effective social scenarios, and different social scenarios and experiences will also have different requirements for the design of avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar identity design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In games, social scenarios are created for players through task design, challenge design, reward design, and intimate interaction design.</p>
<p>In these group gameplays, in order to facilitate group interaction, more member identity designs and corresponding character assignments are needed, and there should be differentiated gameplay when players join the group. This can be achieved through daily gameplay. When a player joins a group, the administrator should immediately set an identity for him and inform him of the corresponding tasks he needs to do immediately. In this way, differentiation can be expanded through subdivision, the player’s interest chain can be built, and a reasonable scene for social interaction can be created. Games such as <em>Identity V</em>, Werewolf, and LARP (Live Action Role Playing) fully mobilize the players’ subjective initiative with such character identity settings. In some battle scenarios, the matching methods of top lane, middle lane, bottom lane, jungle, and support also strengthen the players’ interest chain and promote the division of labor and cooperation among players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fbd539c22-5e84-4441-8986-5c41049ae829.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Character profiles in “Identity V”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar relationship setting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpersonal pattern of closeness and distance is called the “differential order pattern”. Like ripples spreading on the water surface, it extends from oneself, circle by circle, and divides closeness and distance according to the distance, as shown in the figure below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F774229e3-15a6-4162-abf7-911b0f3cde93.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the group interaction of the game, the relationship setting between avatars can expand more social scenarios. For example, the common relationship settings such as master and apprentice, husband and wife, and gang can trigger different gameplays. Through this relationship setting and gameplay design, players are stimulated to communicate and collaborate with strangers, creating emotional bonds. Players can experience the ambiguity and warmth with the opposite sex in the game, and the communication and cooperation between teams or other groups, so as to achieve the social goals of group interaction and group identification. The gameplay of companionship, bonding, marriage, master-apprentice, grudge, and sect in <em>Revelation</em> applies this relationship setting method. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F857faeae-44b2-4195-b23f-c12b6235e4ab.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar display design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting personal business cards (equipment, titles, achievements, battle records, clearance progress, collection progress, etc.) in the display system is conducive to gaining the attention and recognition of others, satisfying the players’ desire to show off, and plays an important role in the establishment of social relationships. Designs such as likes, sending flowers, worship, and the display of top-ranked player models can not only increase the display effect, but also enhance the interaction between players.</p>
<p>Both <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and <em>Revelation</em> have leaderboard display designs, which can increase users’ group attention and help and encourage users to obtain group identification. In <em>Revelation</em>, when players team up, they can also click on the character card to view detailed information and perform dynamic interactions such as “send gifts” and “step on”. Obtaining the attention of other players through the avatar display system is also one of the ways to gain a sense of identity. </p>

<h2 id="3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design"><a href="#3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design"></a>3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design</h2><p>The popular metaverse social interaction not only has the shadow of virtual social interaction, but also has the characteristics of physical social interaction. It uses technologies such as AR, VR, and XR to build a holographic virtual reality platform. The interaction between us and our friends is no longer just simple voice, text, pictures, and videos. We can also go shopping, watch concerts, and play games together. Everyone does not have to worry about time and space, but enjoy an immersive experience.</p>
<p>With the metaverse empowering the game industry, the terminal devices that carry games will also be iterated, and the game industry may enter an era of wearable devices with VR&#x2F;AR and other technologies as the core. The concept of the metaverse has spawned a large number of VR&#x2F;AR technology implementations. Users can enter virtual reality scenes by wearing VR helmets, AR glasses and other devices to achieve an immersive experience.</p>
<p>The high picture quality and strong physical interaction of VR scenes give more space for the design of virtual avatars. The 3Dization of the image, the smoothness of the action, the closer correspondence between the avatar and the real world, and even the multiple experiences of vision, hearing, and touch have more possibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the creation of virtual identities allows players to be deeply bonded with the game through digital assets, helping the game achieve breakthroughs in user retention. Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said that identity, as one of the eight characteristics of the metaverse, can be regarded as an evolved version of the online identity in current games, and can represent players in a more creative and realistic way through avatars and other methods. In the metaverse game world, the importance of in-game identity and customization options is increasingly prominent. Players will have permanent digital identities and personalized virtual images. Through social activities in the game with virtual identities, they can obtain matching digital assets or custom assets, such as virtual land, houses, works of art, and pets, to achieve an immersive experience similar to the real world.</p>
<p>The self-expression of virtual identity is not only the continuous expansion of personalized images. With the rise of the emerging concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), people will interact in the digital world with the same freedom and trust capabilities as in the real world. The avatar is no longer just a mapping of self-awareness, but is more likely to become one of the roles in real life.</p>
