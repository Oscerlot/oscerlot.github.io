<p>&nbsp;<br>Nostalgia is good business.</p>
<p>On June 16th, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> was officially released and achieved good results. When the theme song of the 1987 TV animation <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> is played, you will know that the main theme of this game is nostalgia. Everything in the game now seems to have a sense of age, and it can immediately take people back to the time when they were sitting in front of the TV watching cartoons or playing cartridge games years ago. Its target users are also very clear, namely the audience of the animation at that time and the arcade game players in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Now it seems that these products born for nostalgia still have countless old players paying for them, which makes more manufacturers today see this good business. We can also see that by 2022, there are more and more products that use nostalgia to attract users. So, how to use nostalgia to attract players? And why do people love “nostalgia” so much?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work"><a href="#1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?"></a>1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?</h2><p>Nowadays, players who are attracted by sentiment have a relatively high tolerance for the quality of games, but with the development and maturity of sentiment, players’ demand for the quality of such games is also rapidly increasing. Many game manufacturers that play the nostalgia card have also realized the development and changes of players’ current needs, and have begun to carry out more detailed operations for the theme of “nostalgia”. From the player’s point of view, even if they have long realized that the manufacturer is using the banner of nostalgia to make money, when they see those familiar scenes and characters, they will still involuntarily feel a surge in their hearts and open their wallets.</p>
<p>So, how do manufacturers manipulate “nostalgia”?</p>
<h3 id="Original-Flavor"><a href="#Original-Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Original Flavor"></a>Original Flavor</h3><p>In August 2019, <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> was launched, which can be said to be a milestone of the “original flavor” school. Behind the popularity, the nostalgic culture has set off another wave of trends in game media, live broadcast platforms, and video websites. The player group and the capital market have given double certification to Classic. The concept of “original flavor” has also been further consolidated in the minds of many game manufacturers. After all, before this, very few online games were willing to bring out old content from more than ten years ago almost unchanged and sell it, even if they wanted to sell it, they would carry out a series of operations such as “HD remake”, “gameplay optimization”, and “introduction of innovation”.</p>
<p>Now it seems that Classic can bring huge benefits. The rough pictures and immature designs of the original flavor not only did not expose their shortcomings, but instead became a weapon to evoke players’ feelings at the first time. While everyone complains about the imbalance and inconvenience, they don’t forget to add a sentence “It was like this back then”, and then happily eat the meal of remembering the past.</p>
<p>The success of all this also proves the feasibility of “original flavor” restoration from the side. If players are given the opportunity to play again from scratch, most people will burst out with a higher desire to consume than before, with a yearning for the past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/b31a4b1f-2848-43a5-8f58-fdab99a2e095.png"></p>
<h3 id="Old-Formula-New-Taste"><a href="#Old-Formula-New-Taste" class="headerlink" title="Old Formula, New Taste"></a>Old Formula, New Taste</h3><p>Different from the “true original flavor” of Classic, there are also some nostalgic products that focus more on providing players with the first impression of “the same as before”, and adding new elements that meet current trends in gameplay design, functional modules, and social systems. Many of the gameplay and functions of these games are now considered to be in the category of “dead on arrival”. After years of exploration, manufacturers have also researched their own solutions that both capture the nostalgic mentality of old players and adapt to the current market.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the production team deliberately restored the previous rich scene interaction and exaggerated and humorous plot settings in the game. For example, in the previous <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> series, players could hit the manhole cover thrown by the enemy to defeat the opponent; enemies would suddenly burst out of the window from the shops on the street; when players encountered various trap scenes, they might also be crushed into slices, smashed into pieces, burned into small black figures, and even rubbed their eyes when they were splashed with sand, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/3755c316-84a4-4a3d-b804-6be5a3fb21a6.png"></p>
<p>But while restoring the former flavor, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> also added a lot of new things. In terms of design, an attribute system has been added. The three attributes of range, speed, and power are different according to the characteristics of the character itself; in terms of operation, more operation commands have been added, such as double jump, dodge and other actions; in terms of gameplay, the “ultimate skill” has added an energy bar design, and a blocking system has also been introduced for monsters; in terms of social interaction, more cooperative gameplay has been added, such as combos, interactions, rescues, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/92ec7849-718a-4d4a-9a41-5f3a39b7c283.png"></p>
<p>For individual players, when this game reappears in front of them “unchanged” after many years, they will feel somewhat unclear. The players still want to play this game, but because people’s aesthetics and mentality are constantly changing, now it has put on a more “fashionable coat” and appeared in front of the players in a brand new posture, which must be more fascinating.</p>
<h3 id="Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”"><a href="#Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Social “New Trend”"></a>Creating a Social “New Trend”</h3><p>For manufacturers, longer-term nostalgia is not only efficient harvesting of feelings, but also allows themselves to become a new topic of trend. In the business of nostalgia, social attributes, as a positive factor that can connect players’ emotions and promote the spontaneous spread of the game among players’ communities, can to a certain extent amplify the symbolic marketing of nostalgia and make it a new trend for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mole Manor</em>, as a childhood memory of the post-90s generation, was originally a children’s game for elementary school to junior high school students. Therefore, when the game manufacturer relaunched this game, they needed to consider how to satisfy the feelings and attract the adult group. Based on this, the operation of <em>Mole Manor</em> mobile game is to push topics such as “working in the game”, “checking in at internet celebrity shops and internet celebrity attractions”, and “establishing a fan community” to the vast social platform. By fitting the current state of the players who have grown up, the social attributes are amplified, and a certain degree of gameplay is abandoned, leading to a wave of “nostalgic new trends”. </p>

<h2 id="2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun"><a href="#2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun" class="headerlink" title="2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?"></a>2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?</h2><p>In general, this type of game is still more about nostalgia than gameplay. So why is it that playing a game from many years ago feels more fun than modern games?</p>
<h3 id="Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment"><a href="#Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment" class="headerlink" title="Unburdened Pure Enjoyment"></a>Unburdened Pure Enjoyment</h3><p>Today’s games are constantly improving in quality, and the game content is becoming more and more detailed, and the requirements for players are also increasing. When playing games, players have more information to receive and process: more refined graphics, more detailed music, more realistic animations and interactive systems. Although these elements make the game as a whole more refined and beautiful, it has to be admitted that they also bring more burden to players.</p>
<p>In other words, more delicate motion animations and more realistic sound effects bring players a “real” sense of immersion; but at the same time, the problem is that the difficulty of game operation will also increase, which requires players to adapt to the operation. In comparison, sometimes it is indeed not as good as the pure enjoyment brought by easier-to-use game operations and higher fun, which is more popular with players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/82ca5657-2dc3-43cb-ad46-7d00a042871d.png"></p>
<h3 id="Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again"><a href="#Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again" class="headerlink" title="Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again"></a>Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again</h3><p>The irreplaceable emotional value can help nostalgic games recall the most loyal core players. This value is partly given by the unique gameplay of the game itself, and on the other hand, it is also deeply hidden in the emotional connection of playing games with friends in the past.</p>
<p>For players, when mentioning a certain game, the biggest nostalgic memory may be around playing with friends, making friends in the game, sharing interests, and enjoying the experience of mutual competition and cooperation. So when a nostalgic game is relaunched, players can’t help but recall the happiness that this game once brought them, and they will think of the time when they left their friends in the game or cooperated with them in the process of completing tasks. These experiences allow players to have a deeper social connection with others, and naturally they will pour deeper emotions into this game, prompting them to download the game again even after so many years, and then poke the friends who played with them back then: Hey, do you want to play another round together?</p>
<h3 id="Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics"><a href="#Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics"></a>Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics</h3><p>In today’s various AAA games, when the game has a set of movie-level graphics and narrative, resources must continue to tilt towards the most prominent parts of the game, such as the sense of impact, the sense of substitution, the audio-visual sensory experience, etc. to improve the quality of the game in all aspects. On the contrary, some of the gameplay and mechanics have not improved with the development of the game. Such games are like a production line, one generation after another. For most players, it may just be that the graphics and actions are more realistic, and the map is larger. The old games of the past, although the game content is not so close to reality, but because of this, the excellent old games that have been passed down are more purely because of their advanced core gameplay, which is addictive.</p>
<p>Therefore, when facing countless masterpieces, players will unconsciously feel that they want to play every game, but they don’t want to click on any game, or they want to turn it off and scroll through their phone after playing for 40 minutes. However, playing the “nostalgic” remake with a nostalgic mentality is so fond of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/22245a29-6bbe-448f-a70a-a4bfed210737.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely"><a href="#3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely" class="headerlink" title="3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely"></a>3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely</h2><p>“Fun, not necessarily long-lasting”, best describes the state of this type of nostalgic game. For players, their happy experience of this type of game may only be 2 hours.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the game has the feeling of playing through arcade games before, but it cannot provide enough motivation for repeated play. Even if each level is made to feel uniquely “new”, due to the repetitive mechanism, if you play more than 10 levels in a row, you will still feel tired.</p>
<p>When players play, they may lose interest after playing two levels with different characters, and the gameplay lacks stamina. If you try to solve the problem of repeated play motivation through the plot, such as branch plot drive, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> does not even have a decent main plot, and it is difficult for players to have the motivation to repeatedly play levels.</p>
<p>However, if you want to continue to get game fun, the ideal situation is to play multiplayer online with friends you know in real life. Combined with the original intention of game development, multiplayer online can also better reproduce the feeling of playing happily with friends in the living room, arcade hall and other places when you were a child. This may be the best and most correct way to open <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. Once you can’t find friends to play with, after playing a few times with random matches, you may still quickly lose motivation due to the aforementioned factors.</p>
<p>Back to what was said at the beginning, nostalgia is good business. It’s okay to make nostalgic games. What is really difficult to reproduce is the days of playing games in the past.</p>
