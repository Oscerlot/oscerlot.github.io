<p>There are many ways to tell a story. It can be expressed in novels, movies, plays, and many other art forms. Telling a story with a game has a very unique advantage, that is, interactivity. In the process of experiencing the game, players truly play the role of the characters in the story, connect with the characters in the story, and then advance the plot. In some games, the player’s behavior will also determine the final direction of the plot. The player is not only the listener of the story, but also the creator of the story. There are also many ways of game narration. This article will briefly introduce them, and focus on the advantages and disadvantages of fragmented narration and its application in games.</p>
<h2 id="I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration"><a href="#I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration" class="headerlink" title="I. Common Ways of Game Narration"></a>I. Common Ways of Game Narration</h2><h3 id="Linear-Narrative"><a href="#Linear-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Linear Narrative"></a>Linear Narrative</h3><p>Typical linear narratives include games such as <em>Death Stranding</em> and the <em>Call of Duty</em> series. These linear narrative games make players feel like watching a fine movie in terms of plot. There are a lot of main quests and cutscenes. Linear narrative sacrifices a certain degree of freedom in experience in exchange for the stability of players’ acceptance of the plot. Players are more passive in receiving plot information, such as watching a cutscene after completing a main quest to get the plot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/309534a0-1228-4892-89c7-d9230b22a98c.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The “Call of Duty” series uses a lot of game cutscenes, and the plot will be triggered after the player plays for a period of time</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Branching-Narrative"><a href="#Branching-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Branching Narrative"></a>Branching Narrative</h3><p>The overall structure is similar to linear narrative. The biggest difference is that branching points are added to the game. Players make different choices and enter different plot lines, such as <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, <em>Quantum Break</em>, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/d41affaa-872e-457b-99c8-a225bb512a4b.png"></p>

<h3 id="Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Fragmented Narrative"></a>Fragmented Narrative</h3><p>Literally, fragmented narrative is to split the overall plot into fragments and integrate them with various contents in the game. For example, after a player obtains a certain item, they obtain key clues about the relationship between characters in the game or the plot from the item description; when a player encounters a BOSS under certain conditions, they trigger hidden dialogues to obtain information; the main line of the fragmented narrative game will not be very clear. Players need to actively discover the information hidden in various corners and piece them together (sometimes requiring some imagination) to obtain a plot story understood and created by the players themselves. The following will also focus on examples.</p>
<h2 id="II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games"><a href="#II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="II. Fragmented Narrative in Games"></a>II. Fragmented Narrative in Games</h2><p>The application of fragmented narrative in games is very common. For example, in <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, a large amount of information is integrated with props, injecting this method of finding information in props into the player’s subconscious at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>The Wolf, played by the player, receives a letter from an unknown person at the beginning of the game. The description of this letter not only contains the content of the letter, but also a sentence “A letter thrown to the bottom of the well by someone”. It not only wants to inform the player of the content of the letter, but also wants the player to understand where this item comes from, what information is related to the item, who is it related to, and why. So that players slowly get used to this narrative method of integrating information into props, and gradually arouse their curiosity. </p>

<p>Many settings in the game are not directly presented to the player in the form of animation or text, but are recorded in various items obtained by the player. Players will have a more cherished attitude towards the items obtained through difficult battles. </p>

<p><em>Sekiro uses various props to tell the history of the Sekiro world</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the most direct plot is only the introduction of the game’s background, that is, heroes from all walks of life gather in Morus Isle to compete for the Immortal Mask. But are these heroes related to each other? For this reason, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also uses some fragmented narrative techniques to introduce the background of the characters and the connections between them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>![](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/4b98449a-9dfb-476f-b5fe-8067acfecbbc.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/4b98449a-9dfb-476f-b5fe-8067acfecbbc.png</a>. </p>

<p>For example, in the fashion description, the origin and story of this fashion are added, telling the background of Kurumi and her best friend Viper Ning becoming enemies. This setting also attracts many players to explore the reasons why Viper Ning and Kurumi changed from best friends to enemies.</p>
<h2 id="III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative"></a>III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative</h2><p>Fragmented narrative has received widespread attention in recent years with the popularity of games such as <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Due to some of its characteristics, it has corresponding advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-Players"><a href="#Advantages-for-Players" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for Players"></a>Advantages for Players</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Extends game time and has a better new game plus experience</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative splits a lot of information into various corners of the game, and players can have a richer experience in exploration. In contrast, when experiencing linear narrative games, many players may leave the game after experiencing the main quest once, and will not open it a second time. Fragmented narrative gives players a lot of room for exploration. Players who want to piece together a more complete plot need to explore more carefully in new game plus, obtain more props and clues, enhance the player’s experience in subsequent playthroughs, and alleviate the repetition of multiple playthroughs. Players can be pleasantly surprised to discover more game details and plot connections.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High degree of freedom, players can choose the plot direction they want to explore</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative does not directly present the plot to the player like linear narrative, but lets the player explore it themselves. This gives the player a higher degree of freedom, that is, what information they want to obtain is determined by the player’s own initiative. The plot is lengthy, unimportant, or uninteresting. Content can be chosen not to be explored, and plot connections that are of great interest can be chosen to be explored first.</p>
<p>When players piece together clues, they often add a process of imagination, which allows different players to have different understandings of the game plot. Under the official setting, various understandings can be made, as long as the logic is complete and reasonable. It can become the perfect story in the player’s mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/215377a7-9834-4eab-b576-e52624005b41.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In “Elden Ring”, players are allowed to interpret the story themselves. It is not just the order of reading the story, even the internal logical order of the story is not fixed</em></p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Stronger sense of immersion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In fragmented narrative games, players not only need to complete combat levels, but also need to complete the collection and piecing together of the plot, and even some imagination. The process of exploration further enhances the player’s sense of immersion. Players need to actively recall, think, and piece together a complete plot, rather than passively accepting the instillation of cutscenes.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-the-Game"><a href="#Advantages-for-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for the Game"></a>Advantages for the Game</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Relatively low cost and flexible development</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of fragmented narrative can use a large amount of text bound to props, NPCs, etc., reducing the production of cutscenes and real-time rendering, thereby reducing costs. At the same time, the content of fragmented narrative is relatively discrete, and the content connection in the plot is relatively less tight. It will be more natural to modify or delete during the development process, and the overall impact on the plot is smaller.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Different players have different understandings of the plot, which will trigger higher discussion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the plot of a fragmented narrative game requires players to collect, piece together, and imagine. Players will have different understandings of the plot, and the collision of their views will cause intense discussions. Players’ reposts and discussions on social media can increase the popularity of the game and attract more fresh blood.</p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>It should be noted that some of the above advantages of fragmented narration are also double-edged swords, which may become disadvantages for different players.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Friendly to new game plus players, but not friendly to light players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of the game takes a lot of time to dig out. Some places may need to be revisited, and some clues may be deeply buried. These are of course a great pleasure for players who are keen on exploring, but for some players who just want a light experience, The game burden is relatively heavier. For such players, the linear narrative movie-like plot flow experience will be better.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High requirements for plot copywriting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative presents players with one point after another, but in the eyes of copywriters, it must be a rigorous logical framework. A large number of clues must be guaranteed to be free of contradictions and contain a certain amount of information. If the game is full of useless clues, players will question it as being pretentious and unintelligible.</p>
<p>If there is a deviation in the focus of the game plot, it will be difficult for players to experience the core plot that the game really wants to convey. Excellent copywriting can ensure that more players move towards the key clues and plots, and ensure the player’s experience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Higher memory cost for players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Although many games can take out props at any time to view descriptions and clues, a large amount of text content describes the background of the story and the relationship between characters through props or NPCs, which still brings a certain memory burden to players. Players need to recall in a large number of props which props describe which characters can piece the fragments together.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Conclusion"><a href="#IV-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="IV. Conclusion"></a>IV. Conclusion</h2><p>The fragmented narrative method has become familiar to more players with the popularity of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> in recent years. Its advantages and disadvantages are obvious. Players who like this method will be very obsessed with exploring the plot, so that there are so many “Soul scholars”, “Sekiro scholars”, and “Elden Ring scholars” constantly exploring and producing content to share and discuss.</p>
<p>Optimizing the experience of light players in the plot, while ensuring the exploration experience of deep players, can allow more players to change from light to deep, and explore those mysterious worlds. Excellent fragmented narrative plots are carefully arranged by copywriters to present players with an epic story. Those games that use the name of fragmented narrative but actually have fragmented plots, far-fetched connections, and obscurity are “pretentious”.</p>
