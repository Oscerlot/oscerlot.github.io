<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the improvement of living standards and changes in consumption habits, games have gradually become the mainstream leisure method and social activity for consumers. In 2021, the actual sales revenue of China’s game market was 296.513 billion yuan, an increase of 17.826 billion yuan compared with the previous year, but the growth rate decreased by nearly 15% year-on-year. Affected by the epidemic and the global economy, China’s consumer confidence index has fluctuated significantly in the past two years. </p>
<p>![China’s Consumer Confidence Index - Recent 10 Years](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/cbebdcf1-16cb-4445-9179-de9a6576e2e7.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/cbebdcf1-16cb-4445-9179-de9a6576e2e7.png</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/a2a3255f-0714-44f4-a419-fb6dda1f6280.png" alt="Global Consumer Confidence Index - July 2022"></p>
<p>In terms of game payment, the current game market in China presents the characteristics of “low payment rate and high payment amount”. In 2021, the number of game users in China was 666 million, a year-on-year increase of 0.22%, and the number of users is gradually saturated. The penetration rate of mobile game users reached a peak of 75.9% in 2016. Due to policy tightening and other entertainment methods such as short videos grabbing potential game users, it fell to 66.3% in 2020. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/854192e8-02c5-48d0-a2d8-f7a983e7d3ea.png" alt="Simple Calculation Formula for Mobile Game Revenue"></p>
<p>Young people, mainly Generation Z, will gradually become the mainstream group of game consumption. “Pursuing fashion”, “expressing self-personality” and “focusing on emotions” are all their consumption labels. To sum up, there are four obvious characteristics of the consumption upgrade phenomenon of young consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the “low-desire society”, consumption is polarized: rationalization of rigid demand and high frequency of spiritual demand;</li>
<li>Consumption upgrade enters the 2.0 era: from material consumption upgrade to spiritual consumption upgrade, users are more likely to be touched by feelings and pay for the spiritual world; pursue refinement and aesthetics; improve their own literacy through consumption, etc.;</li>
<li>Cultural belonging and national trend identity are increasingly prominent</li>
<li>Consumption circles in urban and rural areas and between generations are increasingly solidifie.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/9a2a7d35-d446-4076-a038-776b459453ce.png" alt="Generation Z Online Consumption Survey (Have you ever had the following payment behaviors)"></p>
<p>The consumption upgrade characteristics presented by this new consumer group will also lead the trend of changes in the game industry, including changes in game pricing power (consumption is tilted towards high-quality game products, paying more attention to the multi-dimensional and deep-level added value brought by the product such as experience, feeling, and atmosphere), changes in game mode (“content + form” games and strong rule games with storylines as the main body), changes in integration paths (“game +” and “+ game” forms) and changes in experience methods (breakthrough of circle layers and fragmented time game collaboration).</p>
<p>In other words, the current demographic dividend of the domestic game industry has receded, but in the future, with the increase in China’s per capita disposable income and the strengthening of young people’s willingness to pay for online entertainment, the industry’s payment rate still has a large room for improvement. Next, this article will start from the perspective of consumer psychology to talk about why you are willing to pay in the game, and what factors will affect your payment decision.</p>
<h2 id="1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention"><a href="#1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention" class="headerlink" title="1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention"></a>1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention</h2><p>Consumer psychology mainly studies the psychological phenomena and behavior patterns of consumers in consumption activities. Simply put, consumer action &#x3D; consumer psychology + consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Common consumer psychology includes seeking practicality (the use value of goods &amp; services), seeking beauty (the artistic value and appreciation value of goods), seeking convenience (convenient to buy or carry), comparison (satisfying curiosity and not falling behind), herd mentality and so on.</p>
<p>Purchase intention is the possibility that consumers will buy a certain product or service, and the probability of being willing to take a specific purchase behavior is high or low. It is the subjective tendency of consumers to choose a specific product, and it is an important indicator for predicting consumer behavior. Factors that affect purchase intention are often:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer personality characteristics:</strong> including demographics (gender&#x2F;age&#x2F;occupation&#x2F;income&#x2F;education level) and specific factors (such as the purchase intention of food is related to the consumer’s health status);</li>
<li><strong>Product internal cues:</strong> attributes related to the use value of the product, such as use value, quality characteristics, etc. That is, consumers are to obtain the products they need to meet their own needs, which is the main driving force for consumers to take purchasing behavior;</li>
<li><strong>Product external cues:</strong> relative to internal cues, external factors unrelated to the product’s own attributes, such as price, brand, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Consumption situation factors:</strong> Consumers’ purchasing decisions will change with changes in the situation factors they are in, such as store design, surrounding environment, salesperson performance, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> When the level of purchasing power is constant, market demand is a function of purchase intention. From a macroeconomic perspective, the lack of purchase intention of residents within a certain period of time is due to the decline in the growth of residents’ immediate income and expected income.</li>
</ul>
<p>For consumers, the purchase decision is usually a progressive thinking: whether it can meet my needs, whether I have enough money to buy, and whether it is affordable among similar choices.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the real economy &amp; e-commerce, there are many common situations related to consumer behavior and psychology.</p>
<h3 id="Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’"><a href="#Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’" class="headerlink" title="Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’"></a>Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’</h3><p>When making decisions, consumers rarely buy directly without comparison. At this time, in order for consumers to make purchase decisions better and faster, merchants often provide a “decoy” for the target product to encourage consumers to buy. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/f4a929d9-dd36-4e18-b194-97ad2ba2b8c7.png" alt="Membership Pricing in APP: Both internal comparison - monthly&#x2F;quarterly&#x2F;annual, and comparison between single membership and combined membership to promote purchase"></p>
<h3 id="Case-2-Pay-Attention-to-the-‘Ambiguity-Effect’-to-Promote-Ice-Breaking-Consumption"><a href="#Case-2-Pay-Attention-to-the-‘Ambiguity-Effect’-to-Promote-Ice-Breaking-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="Case 2: Pay Attention to the ‘Ambiguity Effect’ to Promote Ice-Breaking Consumption"></a>Case 2: Pay Attention to the ‘Ambiguity Effect’ to Promote Ice-Breaking Consumption</h3><p>People tend to choose clear options and avoid unknown options. If users don’t understand your product, or a particular feature, they won’t choose it. If you want to design a mall gift package for the game, you need to give players a full understanding, especially for those new players who are just starting to experience the game, what props they can get in the gift package, and what price advantages they have, need to be fully described.</p>
<h3 id="Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props"><a href="#Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props" class="headerlink" title="Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props"></a>Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props</h3><p>When people make judgments about something&#x2F;someone, they are easily dominated by first impressions or the first information they receive, just like an anchor sinking to the bottom of the sea, fixing people’s thoughts somewhere. For example, if a consumer sees the price of a certain product for the first time, then the price of this first impression will have a huge impact on her.</p>
<p>In the game, the pricing of the mall often plays the role of “anchor”. Perhaps the sales of direct purchases in the mall are not high, but when the event gift package is launched, players will compare the price in the gift package with the mall pricing, thus feeling cheap and affordable.</p>
<h2 id="2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation"><a href="#2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation"></a>2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation</h2><p>Currently, more and more people believe that games are closer to a service industry. Players experience the game, in fact, they are enjoying the service content designed by the game developers and paying for it. Not only the game play design itself, its social atmosphere, operation mode, and economic system are all part of the player’s evaluation. With the weakening and disappearance of the demographic dividend, the game industry has turned to competition for existing players. Doing a good job in the game and doing a good job in experience is also more important for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>To understand players’ payment motivation, we can start by understanding players’ game motivation. Many organizations and individuals have studied players’ game motivation, mainly out of personal self-satisfaction, social needs, etc. </p>
<p>![Quantic Foundry Player Motivation Model](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/5b51d3f6-b095-41b8-ba47-31e534eed36c.jpg">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/5b51d3f6-b095-41b8-ba47-31e534eed36c.jpg</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221128/d2809302-a7a3-4c57-a8c5-91bbaa5bb232.jpg" alt="Google Play Distinguishes 5 Types of Players from Two Dimensions: Game Social and Game Passion"></p>
<p>In order to meet the game needs of different types of players, the paid content in the game has become increasingly diverse, and players with different motivations can find the one that suits their needs in the game. For example, players whose main game motivation is “achievement” are more likely to pay to achieve the goals of the achievement&#x2F;collection system; players who value “social” have a greater willingness to buy appearance items; players who want to “crush others” are more interested in ability-enhancing paid content.</p>
<h2 id="3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment"><a href="#3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment" class="headerlink" title="3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment"></a>3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment</h2><p>Game products can be divided into hardware products (game consoles, accessories, etc.) and software products (online games, mobile games, etc.). Here, we will mainly discuss game software products, especially the payment design in non-buyout games, that is, the payment content related to the game itself.</p>
<p>Games are no longer a “one-shot deal”. Paying attention to the player’s full-process experience in the game, putting users first, and improving user experience are one of the tenets of most game manufacturers. Combining factors such as game motivation, game design, and consumer psychology, we can also extract some factors that may affect players’ payment in the game, so as to better understand why players choose to pay in the game, and what kind of game experience they hope to obtain through payment. In addition to the theme characteristics of players (gender, age, education, etc.), the following factors are worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment"><a href="#Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment" class="headerlink" title="Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment"></a>Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment</h3><p>In an analysis of the online game consumption behavior of college players, researchers found that “entertainment and sociality” is the biggest influencing factor. Players are eager to make new friends, maintain and deepen existing friendships while enjoying online games. At the same time, they hope to gain a sense of existence and achievement that cannot be satisfied in the real world through self-participation.</p>
<p>In addition, players also hope that the game can entertain themselves and relieve pressure. They hope to express themselves through better dressing&#x2F;strength, or show their economic strength and attract attention.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Practical-Value"><a href="#In-Game-Practical-Value" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Practical Value"></a>In-Game Practical Value</h3><p>Most in-game paid content has practical value in the game, such as improving character abilities, saving game time, accumulating game resources, facilitating certain game activities, helping to complete certain tasks, etc. For these reasons, players may take payment actions.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Quality-Itself"><a href="#Game-Quality-Itself" class="headerlink" title="Game Quality Itself"></a>Game Quality Itself</h3><p>According to the statistics of Gamma Data, among the top 250 games in China in 2019, only 15.3% were “obviously innovative” types, but they contributed 62.3% of the total revenue of these games. Chinese players are obviously more willing to pay for games with excellent graphics and innovative gameplay. With the tightening of policies, some homogenous games with ordinary graphics, monotonous content and gameplay, and short player life cycle value will gradually disappear. The increase in the proportion of high-quality games will hopefully drive the overall ARPU value of the industry.</p>
<p><em>ARPU, that is, average revenue per user, is an indicator used by operators to measure the revenue from each end user.</em></p>
<p>Whether the game is innovative and refined enough (including picture quality, gameplay content, story theme, game style, plot characters, etc.), whether it is easy to get started, and whether the quality of related services is timely and effective will affect players’ payment decisions.</p>
<h3 id="External-Market-Impact"><a href="#External-Market-Impact" class="headerlink" title="External Market Impact"></a>External Market Impact</h3><p>The game industry is not operating independently. Players also pay attention to the legal and policy environment, such as the anti-addiction regulations for minors that manufacturers have been working to optimize in recent years; marketing such as celebrity effects, IP linkage, etc.; and hardware configuration, players’ network speed, and the dependence of game products on device configuration.</p>
<h3 id="Consumption-Preferences"><a href="#Consumption-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Consumption Preferences"></a>Consumption Preferences</h3><p>Game payment is no different from other payment behaviors. As consumers, players will first consider the economic value of their content: whether the price is affordable, whether it is reasonable, and whether it is affordable; some game prop content also has a certain ‘investment value’, and players consider whether they can sell it at a higher price in the future; there will also be some players who regard game payment as ‘one of the necessary game processes’.</p>
<h3 id="Other-Payment-Experiences"><a href="#Other-Payment-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Other Payment Experiences"></a>Other Payment Experiences</h3><p>Game payment can also learn from the experience of e-commerce payment. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of website speed (purchase process): As long as the waiting time exceeds three seconds, 57% of consumers will give up browsing the webpage, and 80% of consumers will not return to the website;</li>
<li>Overall website design (payment design UI): 92.6% of consumers said that visual enjoyment is the main factor affecting purchasing decisions, and they will decide whether to consume in just 1 and a half minutes;</li>
<li>Price discrimination: In the口碑崩盘 (kǒu bēi bēng pán - reputation collapse) incident encountered by the game “Invisible Guardian”, “inconsistent pricing” triggered a lot of negative reviews from players.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In general, paying in a game is not a one-way request, but providing high-quality services to meet the needs of players. Game as a Service (GAAS) on the one hand means that the game is no longer a one-time purchase for consumers, but a longer-term participation, and it is a commitment by game developers to provide players with continuous operation and continuous updates; on the other hand, it also requires developers to pay attention to the full-process and all-round experience of players in the game journey, and continuously polish products with the goal of “providing a better game user experience”.</p>
