<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When it comes to checking in, you must be familiar with it. From reporting to school as a child to clocking in at work now, checking in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. In games, we can often see this delightful and worrying check-in design.</p>
<p>We hope to get corresponding rewards through check-ins, but too many check-ins will make us feel bored. And check-ins do have a magical attraction for us. To exaggerate, as long as the “check-in” function is added, we will unconsciously check in to receive rewards. Nowadays, the “addictive” effect of check-ins has also prompted more games and mobile applications to add this function to their products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/fb44828e-b915-4989-8afa-7197145bb36f.png"></p>
<p><em>Check-in Page in the Game</em></p>
<p>In game products, check-in means that the player has logged in to the game or participated in a certain activity. It refers to the player’s operation on the game interface at a specific time and conveys to the system that the product has been used. This method improves the user activity and retention rate of the game to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Nowadays, check-in activities have basically become a standard gameplay in every game, especially check-ins during special events or festivals, which play an important role in maintaining high player activity during the event. It is precisely because the check-in system in the game has a strong attraction to players, allowing players to obtain certain rewards after checking in, that makes players dependent on and “addicted” to check-ins.</p>
<p>Although check-ins will also bring an uncomfortable sense of restraint to some players, this sense of restraint is generally replaced by the pleasure of various rewards. Even if some players still cannot accept this method, it is undeniable that the design of the check-in function does have great appeal to players, while maintaining a high level of player activity in the game for a certain period of time, and even attracting some fans who are keen on checking in.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?"></a>1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?</h2><h3 id="Game-Perspective"><a href="#Game-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Game Perspective"></a>Game Perspective</h3><p>For game products, the design of the check-in function mainly serves to increase player activity, improve retention, attract new users, and promote revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Activity:</strong> Through the check-in function, the game allows players to log in to the game every day, increasing player activity in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> The check-in function allows players to form a habit of playing the game through this form, encouraging players to go online and receive rewards as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Attract New Users:</strong> Attracting new users means that players can share socially through check-in tasks, so that the number of players can be increased to a certain extent.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Revenue:</strong> Promoting revenue is to guide players to transform from non-paying players to paying players by differentiating rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Player-Perspective"><a href="#Player-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Player Perspective"></a>Player Perspective</h3><p>From the player’s perspective, the main purpose of players checking in is to obtain certain rewards. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, rewards are mainly divided into material and spiritual rewards.</p>
<p>First, players can get material rewards: that is, players can get game points, prizes, skins, props and a series of rewards that attract them to log in through check-ins. Second, players can get spiritual rewards: that is, the rewards obtained by players through check-ins make them emotionally satisfied (the need to be praised and recognized by others), and self-actualization (such as game rankings, achievement completion, obtaining medals, etc.).</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of whether it is from the game perspective or the player perspective, the check-in design meets the needs of both parties. It can not only meet the deep needs of players for material and spiritual rewards, but also bring high attention, activity and retention rates to the game. Therefore, the importance of designing check-in functions in products is self-evident.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players"><a href="#2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?"></a>2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?</h2><p>After understanding what check-in is and why we should design check-in, we need to discuss why check-in design is so “magical” and makes players fall into the cycle of check-ins. We believe that two points are very important.</p>
<h3 id="Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol"><a href="#Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol" class="headerlink" title="Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol"></a>Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol</h3><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, check-in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. It can be said that check-in has become a “super symbol” implanted in our brains. This forms that as long as it is any check-in design, players will unconsciously click to check in. Because they already have expectations for check-in in their minds, check-in will always have an attraction effect on players.</p>
<h3 id="Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in"><a href="#Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in" class="headerlink" title="Psychological Suggestion of Check-in"></a>Psychological Suggestion of Check-in</h3><p>Check-in behavior is generally considered to be continuous, so after players start checking in, they will tend to complete it continuously. And players have a clear understanding of check-in. If they complete the check-in, they will get rewards. If they continue to complete the check-in, they will get more rewards. This psychological suggestion will drive players to actively complete the check-in. The check-in function first deeply attracts players at the psychological level, and then through different check-in designs in the game, players are driven to complete the check-in by psychological inertia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/15ae2316-890d-4f65-998f-92bbc9ac8dde.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?"></a>3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?</h2><p>Since check-in is so attractive to players, how should the check-in in the game be designed? In order to allow players to continue checking in for a long time and stay in the game, the “addiction” model can be incorporated.</p>
<p>The “addiction model” mainly includes four links: trigger, action, reward, and investment. Through the reward mechanism, it stimulates users to repeatedly start the game, cultivates players’ behavior habits, and makes players dependent on and惯性(guàn xìng - inertia) to the game; at the same time, the characteristic function design further improves the activity and retention of existing players in the game, allowing the check-in function to achieve a win-win situation for the game and players.</p>
<h3 id="Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance"><a href="#Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Trigger Design - Player Guidance"></a>Trigger Design - Player Guidance</h3><p>The game check-in has a guiding effect on players. When guiding players, it is necessary to use triggers to drive players to enter the “addiction” cycle of check-in in the game. Triggers can prompt players to take action and give them psychological hints before the player’s check-in behavior begins.</p>
<p>In the game, it is necessary to establish a more obvious check-in prompt to get the player’s attention and increase the exposure of check-in in the game. The commonly used prompt methods in the game are pop-up windows and non-modal reminders of icons. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, when players enter the game, a modal activity window will pop up to remind players of recent activities and activity check-ins. After entering the game, the icons on the right use bright light flashing to highlight the activities and check-in entrance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/3987c1ce-45ea-41f1-9c63-894670635bd0.png"></p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Activity Entrance</em></p>
<p>At the same time, on the left side of the game lobby, task guidance is used to allow players to view the tasks that can be completed every day and obtain corresponding rewards. The setting of simple tasks not only guides players to familiarize themselves with the gameplay, modes, etc. of the game, but also becomes an important auxiliary function for players to experience the game. At the same time, reducing the difficulty of tasks and the amount of stimulation for players, reducing the burden on players, encouraging players to experience the game, and obtaining corresponding rewards after completing tasks, all make the trigger effective and allow players to enter the next link of the “addiction” model. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/68568932-c9db-4c62-b00b-e67b3850a33e.png"></p>

<h3 id="Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals"><a href="#Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Behavior Design - Emotional Goals"></a>Behavior Design - Emotional Goals</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Increase player motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A very important goal of check-in design is to influence player emotions and design player behavior. In the check-in process, it is necessary to provide players with a goal, so that players have expectations in their hearts, and hope that they can complete the goal at a certain stage. When players get closer and closer to this goal in the process, their actions will occur faster.</p>
<p>This effect of accelerating player actions through behavior design will have an impact on player emotions. When the player’s current goal is achieved, their motivation will be restored. Therefore, when the player completes the current stage goal, it is necessary to continue to set the next goal to stimulate the player’s emotional goal. In <em>My Dear Farm</em>, players can get a box of furniture by completing 7 days of check-in. In order to get special prizes, players will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the gift package, the rewards will gradually increase, thereby further increasing player motivation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/c09970fd-a8f5-4efa-8fc1-cecfe616d534.png"></p>
<p><em>《My Dear Farm》 Check-in Interface</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the player’s check-in cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Another aspect of influencing player emotional goals is to reduce the player’s check-in cost. That is, when players face a large amount of information and choices, they will need more time to think, which will greatly increase the player’s burden and then reduce player emotions. Therefore, in the game, breaking down large goals into small goals that are achieved in stages will reduce the burden on players, increase players’ goal expectations, and enhance players’ phased sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the game divides the days of each month into a target cycle of 7 days (i.e., one week). Players will receive gold chips as a reward for accumulating 7 check-ins. In order to obtain this reward and exchange items in the game, everyone will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the 7-day gift package, the better the gift rewards will be. This effectively stimulates the player’s interest, enhances their check-in motivation, and makes the probability of players breaking their check-in streak lower and lower. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/7650609d-791e-49e0-97eb-9e28a30bfebf.png"></p>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 Check-in Page</em></p>
<h3 id="Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior"><a href="#Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior"></a>Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior</h3><p>Players obtain certain rewards through check-ins, which can enhance their check-in motivation. At the same time, the feedback of obtaining rewards reinforces this behavior. Check-in provides players with a new way to obtain game resources. Players only need to maintain loyalty to the game and perform simple check-in operations to obtain corresponding game resources. Of course, the design of rewards should also consider the gradual progress of the process, and it is necessary to meet the different needs of players according to different cycles.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s anniversary celebration interspersed different levels of rewards during the check-in period, fully mobilizing players’ emotions and making them unable to stop once they started checking in. At the same time, they can obtain advanced costumes for new characters during the check-in to guide and strengthen their willingness to experience new characters, and meet the needs of new and old players through other rewards. Even in some games, a complete set of equipment will be broken down into check-in rewards, so that players can continue to complete check-ins to collect the equipment. This method can also stimulate players’ collection needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/2ebd7a9f-ffdd-4a3d-8a5d-ae0b001820f1.png"></p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Anniversary Event Check-in Page</em></p>
<h3 id="Investment-Design-Emotional-Resonance"><a href="#Investment-Design-Emotional-Resonance" class="headerlink" title="Investment Design - Emotional Resonance"></a>Investment Design - Emotional Resonance</h3><p>As the last link of the “addiction” model, the investment design makes players develop a habit for the game by generating emotional resonance with players. The more players invest in the game, the more they will value check-in. The game can start with investment design and mobilize players’ emotions. As the number of check-ins increases, the number of days players have checked in is displayed, and even a personalized check-in commemorative booklet can be customized for players, so that players have a different kind of emotion for the game.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>A Dream of Jianghu</em>, when a player reaches 666 days of check-in, the game thoughtfully prepares a personalized commemorative booklet for the player, visually displaying the player’s investment in the game. This design brings satisfaction and emotional resonance to the player’s emotional experience, and also makes the player unforgettable about the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/6f64a7c4-0690-4693-912b-6b244635ee70.png"></p>
<p><em>《A Dream of Jianghu》 Personalized Commemorative Booklet</em></p>
<h3 id="Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation"><a href="#Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation"></a>Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation</h3><p>In addition to the “addiction” model, attention should also be paid to the characteristic design of check-in. Common check-in activities are designed with regular check-in boards, but long-term presentation in this way will always give people a feeling of fatigue of looking at a calendar, which will cause players to have the burden of completing tasks. Therefore, breaking the conventional design can not only bring players a novel experience, but also highlight the theme of the game or the theme of new activities.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Onmyoji</em>, the design of its check-in interface is presented in the form of daily divination check-in, which is very consistent with the tonality of the game. The way of divination check-in also gives players a novel experience, driving players to unknowingly complete the check-in behavior during the divination process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/58baf0e2-e047-4efd-9284-c07273cb8ee4.png"></p>
<p><em>《Onmyoji: The Card Game》 Check-in Page</em></p>
<p>In the check-in interface of a certain period of activity in <em>Identity V</em>, players can check in by wiping the mirror, and they will also receive corresponding rewards after completing the check-in. In addition to the personalized design of the interface in combination with the game theme, the way of checking in by wiping the mirror is also very novel. At the same time, players will find that every time they wipe the mirror, the tasks in the mirror will change slightly, which hints at the development of the plot and makes players imaginative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220916/dcbd3439-cd1d-4b17-bbad-7fd7aa85b80e.png"></p>
<p><em>《Identity V》 Event Check-in Page</em></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, if the check-in design wants to further attract players, make players develop the habit of logging in to the game every day, and complete the corresponding activity check-ins in the game to obtain rewards, it is necessary to guide players through trigger design, satisfy players’ emotional goals through behavior design, strengthen player behavior through reward design, and arouse player emotional resonance through investment design. And present novel themes with characteristic designs to improve event data.</p>
<p>Although too many check-in designs will make some players feel bored, a good check-in design will definitely not make players feel burdened. As long as the check-in design is integrated with the game and presented in various forms, everything can be used for check-in. If it can make players think of the game unconsciously and develop the habit of opening the game unconsciously, it should be a check-in that players will never forget and love, and it is also a great game that amazes players!</p>
