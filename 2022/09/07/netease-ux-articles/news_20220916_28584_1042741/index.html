<p>The famous printmaker M.C. Escher’s painting “Waterfall” depicts a building that can make a water wheel run forever by relying on a “circulating waterfall.” At first glance, the viewer will feel that the waterfall in the painting is flowing, but upon closer inspection, it will be found that the waterfall in the picture will flow down continuously, but the falling water will flow upstream. This is an optical illusion picture that can be reasonably depicted in two-dimensional space, but cannot actually appear in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1321b0d6-56b4-4ab6-ada8-8c4bfba4d929.jpg/size/" alt="Escher&#39;s famous painting &quot;Waterfall&quot;"></p>
<p>Optical illusions make the viewer’s visual experience contradict normal reasoning, breaking the stereotype of human binary thinking and allowing the viewer’s imagination to break through the boundaries of natural physical laws. In recent years, optical illusion games have captured many players with their unique visual illusions and endless imagination.</p>
<p>In this article, we will mainly introduce three types of visual illusions: impossible spaces, perspective illusions, and Gestalt illusions, and analyze the reasons why optical illusion games attract players.</p>
<h2 id="1-Impossible-Spaces"><a href="#1-Impossible-Spaces" class="headerlink" title="1. Impossible Spaces"></a>1. Impossible Spaces</h2><p>The formation of impossible space utilizes the conversion and alternation of viewpoints, showing three-dimensional forms on a two-dimensional plane, but presenting ambiguous visual effects in the three-dimensional form, causing confusion in space.</p>
<p>The Penrose triangle is a typical impossible figure based on impossible space. It looks like a cube, composed of three cuboids with rectangular cross-sections. The three cuboids form a triangle, but the angle between two cuboids seems to be a right angle. The above properties can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane, but cannot be realized on any normal three-dimensional object. The painting “Waterfall” is precisely through the splicing of two Penrose triangles, making players have the illusion that the waterfall is flowing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F281fcf06-a82e-4b71-abba-bdbe71411201.jpg/size/" alt="Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>The game <em>Monument Valley</em> uses a large number of Penrose triangles as the game screen. The protagonist, IDA, shuttles through the impossible graphic space. Players only need to move or rotate the pillars in a certain order to reconstruct a feasible space and achieve the conditions for safe passage. As shown below, in this level, players need to overcome the three-dimensional illusion generated in the two-dimensional plane, help the protagonist of the game pass through the Penrose triangle corridor and reach another door. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F213753d3-ad61-4982-a425-ce317a9a39a6.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>In addition, the well-known Möbius strip is also an optical illusion phenomenon based on impossible space. A Möbius strip is a paper strip formed by twisting a piece of paper 180 degrees and then gluing the two ends together. If an ant is placed on this ring, it can walk from the front to the back without crossing the boundary, and keep going, giving the viewer an illusion of infinite loop. Although the Möbius strip exists in the three-dimensional world, it only has the characteristics of two-dimensional space. It has only one single-sided surface, rather than two sides in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F5fa6cb5e-4eb4-42dd-8ce5-c4006278e61a.png/size/" alt="Möbius Strip"></p>
<p>The buildings in the game <em>Monument Valley</em> also draw on the Möbius strip. The protagonist IDA can change from standing vertically to standing horizontally through the twisted corridor, that is, gravity has changed, which is an impossible picture in three-dimensional real life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F0154d8f3-3c14-467e-a82f-98c6dee561be.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Möbius Strip"></p>
<h2 id="2-Perspective-Illusions"><a href="#2-Perspective-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="2. Perspective Illusions"></a>2. Perspective Illusions</h2><p>Perspective means that two objects of the same size appear larger when they are closer to the person and smaller when they are farther away. Generally, parallel projection is used in games. In parallel projection, even if the distance of the object changes, the size of the image will not change; but in perspective projection, the distance will affect the size of the image. As shown below, these are two yellow lines of the same length, but the human brain will judge its size according to the environment in which the object is located, and think that the yellow line in the distance is longer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F856c2e2b-fcec-4b22-aabe-88d41d7166f8.png/size/" alt="Perspective Illusion"></p>
<p><em>Superliminal</em> uses the relationship between perspective depth and reference objects as the two core elements of the game. Players must change their perspective and think unconventionally in order to wake up from their dreams. As a basic gameplay, players need to pick up specific props in the environment, change the reference objects, and use the most direct perspective relationship to enlarge or reduce objects, so as to adjust specific props to the appropriate size and achieve the conditions for passing the level. For example, players can use the depth relationship between the cheese and the corridor to enlarge the cheese slice and make it a slope to jump over the hole in the ground. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1535552e-31f8-4b99-955b-46e6198b6cfa.png/size/" alt="Superliminal Cheese"></p>
<p>In the puzzle adventure game <em>Perspective</em>, perspective illusion is the main way to solve puzzles and explore the game world. Players can rotate the camera angle and use visual errors to create visual distance changes between platforms that are originally far apart, creating a path that does not exist to achieve the conditions for passing the level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F7e9803f9-96f6-4565-9367-0f86fc5c71b7.png/size/" alt="Perspective Game"></p>
<h2 id="3-Gestalt-Illusions"><a href="#3-Gestalt-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestalt Illusions"></a>3. Gestalt Illusions</h2><p>When people’s visual center focuses on a complex figure, the human brain will judge the object in front of it according to the familiar shapes or contours stored in memory. After obtaining relevant prompts, people’s visual experience will automatically complete the rest of the incomplete contours in the image. This is what is called Gestalt illusion in psychology. For example, in the figure below, the viewer seems to be able to automatically see a white triangle that does not actually exist. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F60da8bc7-2fb9-4f00-9a53-16b3ffc579b2.png/size/" alt="Gestalt Illusion"></p>
<p>In <em>Monument Valley</em>‘s “Ida’s RED Dream: AIDS charity special edition”, the third level uses the art of Gestalt visual illusion. This is a castle that cannot exist in the real world. Each light gray corridor can be completed by rotating the dark blue building. Players can rely on previous visual experience to automatically connect the corridors. In the game, once the light and shadow are unified, it means that a new path has appeared. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F33fea8c0-c1b0-4eec-9edf-1877fcc9a726.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Ida&#39;s Dream"></p>
<p>In the game <em>Gorogoa</em>, the game screen is divided into four parts, and each area will present a scene for players to explore. Players can zoom in on objects in the picture and find clues that can be spliced or embedded with other scenes, so that the originally static picture will become an animation. This game cleverly uses the Gestalt illusion suspense formed by perceptual prediction and integrates it into the traditional jigsaw puzzle game rules. </p>

<h2 id="4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players"><a href="#4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?"></a>4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?</h2><p>Why can optical illusion games attract players with these wonderful visual phenomena? We have mainly summarized the following three aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene"><a href="#Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene"></a>Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene</h3><p>When the game character moves in the game space, it generally faces a fixed, preset picture. The perspective centered on the picture rather than the player’s control can better present the picture content, and it is also an optimized design that can smoothly advance the plot development, but it can also be critically considered as a manifestation of technological dehumanization.</p>
<p>Video games are places that pursue interactivity, and creators are constantly looking for ways to break the restrictions that bind players’ hands and feet. Optical illusion elements provide this possibility for game creators. In optical illusion games, players are no longer bystanders of the game screen. By manipulating the game perspective, players can actively change certain elements in the game scene. Players enhance their sense of immersion and substitution through interaction with the game scene.</p>
<h3 id="Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes"><a href="#Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes"></a>Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes</h3><p>In the game <em>Moncage</em>, players need to explore by interacting with objects in different worlds, and use visual errors to find a perfect angle to splice certain objects in the two worlds. The process of finding connections in different worlds in the game is not a blind trial and error, but players use their unique observation and imagination to break through the dimensions of time and space to find connections and unlock new spaces one by one. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F2c79c833-1183-4980-8df2-c12dc74a8670.png/size/" alt="Moncage"></p>
<p>The core gameplay of optical illusion games is to change perspectives and use visual differences to find the connections between different scenes, which requires players to break through conventional thinking and explore the true connections between the visual illusions presented in the game screen from different angles. Players can also gain a strong sense of satisfaction after exploring and completing the level.</p>
<h3 id="The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving"><a href="#The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving" class="headerlink" title="The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving"></a>The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving</h3><p>The pictures of optical illusion games are constructed from unique geometric figures and comfortable colors, and are supplemented by beautiful music to give players a beautiful sensory enjoyment. Through the combination of audio-visual elements, players can understand the artistic conception and gameplay of the optical illusion space as a whole, and discover and complete task plots during the interaction process to obtain psychological satisfaction. Players can get the dual pleasure of aesthetics and puzzle solving throughout the game process.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article introduces the main optical illusion phenomena, including: impossible spaces, perspective, and Gestalt illusions. The ingenious design of optical illusions can allow players to experience a visual feast that violates the laws of physics and the pleasure of exploration and puzzle solving. In the game, players need to use their own unique thinking, change perspectives, and use visual differences to combine seemingly unrelated scenes. Incorporating optical illusion elements into action, adventure, role-playing and other games to increase the fun gameplay may also allow players to gain a wonderful experience.</p>
