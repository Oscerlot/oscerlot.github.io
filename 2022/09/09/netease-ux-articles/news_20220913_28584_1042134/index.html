<p>Video games are called interactive art. Players need to integrate themselves into the game world to savor the scenes created by the developers and the stories they write. However, it is not easy to allow players to smoothly solve the puzzles set by the developers without them realizing that they are being restricted by the game’s guidance.</p>
<p>To achieve this, it is first necessary to clarify “what kind of experience” you want to give the players. Only by guiding the direction with this can you accurately create or combine mechanisms that better express the essence of the work. However, “gameplay”, “mechanisms”, and “systems” all these game elements will eventually be mapped to the player’s emotional experience, which is why game experience design starts with emotional experience.</p>
<p>People may forget what someone said, but they will never forget how someone made them feel. Therefore, mobilizing emotions will naturally make people remember that feeling. This is the importance of emotional experience, as the saying goes, “sentimentality” is human nature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/b6edf132-623b-4a29-9dad-6b662fe16090.jpg"></p>
<p>Speaking of this, I’m sure everyone will have doubts: then why don’t players choose the smooth and linear enjoyment of movies, but instead spend energy to challenge and even be a little self-abusive in games? This is precisely because games can bring players unique emotional experiences: a sense of choice, freedom, responsibility, and achievement, etc. These experiences are difficult to obtain through movies or other means.</p>
<h2 id="1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings"><a href="#1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings"></a>1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings</h2><p>Before discussing how to influence players’ emotional experience through design, we need to distinguish between two concepts: emotion and feeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> It is the short-term, instinctive, and impulsive feeling that the player produces. For example, sudden scares in horror games, the surprise of getting a good draw in gacha games, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Feeling:</strong> It is a social, advanced, delicate, and lasting feeling, which is a summary and sublimation based on emotions. For example, you will cry because of the departure of a character in the game, and you will be shocked by the ending of the game for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of individual psychological development, emotions appear earlier, while feelings appear later. Emotions are situational and temporary; feelings are profound and stable. After understanding the concepts of the two, we find that changes in players’ emotions can influence and give rise to different feelings, thereby affecting subsequent experiences and feelings. So how to make reasonable use of players’ emotions has become an important part of emotional experience design.</p>
<h2 id="2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions"><a href="#2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions"></a>2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions</h2><p>The process in which you perceive various influencing factors in the game and trigger emotional fermentation in your heart is the emotional experience, and this process is also constantly affected by “interaction”. The main factors that affect players’ emotions in the game include the following aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Frequency"><a href="#Interaction-Frequency" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Frequency"></a>Interaction Frequency</h3><p>Generally speaking, the higher the frequency of interaction, the more intense the player’s emotions. For example, in a shooting game, players need to simultaneously hold down the keyboard to adjust the position, move the mouse to control the direction, and click the mouse to aim and shoot. The interaction frequency required in the game is very high, and the player’s emotions are prone to be in a more excited and nervous state. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/e41cb8a5-18cf-478d-b237-67a00711661b.gif"></p>
<p>In some puzzle games, it is often necessary to reduce the interaction frequency so that players can switch from tense emotions to relaxed emotions that are conducive to thinking, and reduce the interference and interruption of players’ thoughts with less present interaction methods.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Feedback"><a href="#Interaction-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Feedback"></a>Interaction Feedback</h3><p>Interaction feedback refers to the perceptual feedback that players instantly obtain after performing interactive operations. Feedback is an important part of the interaction process. Only when players receive obvious and sufficient multi-dimensional feedback will they think that the current interaction is meaningful, and the emotions triggered by the interaction will be more real. Conversely, if you don’t want players to perform a certain interactive behavior, just don’t give them any feedback. For example, in a shooting game, if the designer does not allow players to harm their teammates, players will not receive any feedback when they hit their teammates in battle.</p>
<h3 id="Real-time-Performance"><a href="#Real-time-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Real-time Performance"></a>Real-time Performance</h3><p>Real-time performance refers to the visual, auditory, tactile, and other information that players obtain in real time during the game, regardless of whether they interact or not. They can all bring various emotional experiences to players in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In visual performance, different colors (red feels passionate, blue feels calm), different shapes (circles feel gentle, spikes feel dangerous), different shots (looking up feels oppressive, shaking feels uneasy), etc. will make players have different emotions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In auditory performance, different rhythms, instruments, pitches, etc. will also bring different emotions to players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In tactile performance, the maximum level of tactile performance we can achieve so far is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/64eab8b2-c193-4a74-9467-1a143e929808.gif"></p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Use-Emotions-to-Design-Game-Experience"><a href="#3-How-to-Use-Emotions-to-Design-Game-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Use Emotions to Design Game Experience?"></a>3. How to Use Emotions to Design Game Experience?</h2><p>Emotional fluctuations in the game are the most important reason why players can remember and recall this game, so designers need to make clever designs using this.</p>
<h3 id="Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation"><a href="#Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation"></a>Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation</h3><p>To mobilize players’ tension in competitive and action games, a moment is usually created - in this moment, players must complete complex operations accurately and without error to win. For example, dodging and parrying when players fight bosses in the <em>God of War</em> series; players in <em>Dota</em> reverse the situation and win the victory through perfect cooperation with teammates. In these moments, the player’s tension is constantly stimulated, and the emotions are pulled to the highest point and then released like a floodgate at the moment of victory. This pleasure of emotional release is “addictive”. </p>

<p><em>《DOTA2》 Teamfight Comeback</em></p>

<p>Tension can be used, and other emotions can also be used. For example, in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, under the guidance of the plot, players, as members of Task Force 141, fight side by side with their teammates in order to complete the mission of their trusted superior, Shepherd. The repeated battles side by side deepen the friendship between the players and their teammates. In the conversations and work with the teammates, players will recognize the unique personality of each teammate, which deepens the players’ cognitive depth of the NPCs.</p>
<p>But in the later missions, the commander of Task Force 141, Shepherd, betrayed them and mercilessly killed or indirectly harmed the team members. All these changes will make players feel shocked, unbelievable, angry, sad, and broken down. The hatred for Commander Shepherd is high. </p>

<p><em>The classic scene in “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” where “Ghost” and “Roach” go through hardships to complete the mission and break out of the siege, but are betrayed by the long-trusted superior.</em></p>
<p>–. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/7a737f32-4a54-40d3-aa2a-38a5f7b1c318.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The unfortunate “Ghost” and “Roach” are thrown into a pit and burned together.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is this plot that makes players remember the character “Ghost” who is not the protagonist. Even today, six years later, there are still a large number of players who feel sorry for the character “Ghost”, and its related peripheral products are in short supply.</p>
<h3 id="Drive-Emotions-with-Choices"><a href="#Drive-Emotions-with-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Drive Emotions with Choices"></a>Drive Emotions with Choices</h3><p>The above examples all use the simple and strong stimulation of players to generate rapid emotional fluctuations. However, sometimes we want some practices that are slower to take effect but have a longer-lasting impact. At this time, we can try to impact the players’ self-awareness to generate emotional fluctuations. There is a theory in psychology called self-discrepancy theory, which divides everyone’s cognition of themselves into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual self:</strong> Objective and true evaluation of oneself</li>
<li><strong>Ought self:</strong> Feeling that you should do those things, this is your obligation (such as calling 119 when you see a fire)</li>
<li><strong>Ideal self:</strong> What you would do in your ideal self (such as doing charity)</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a gap between the actual self and the ought self, you will feel that you have not fulfilled your responsibilities and obligations, and then you will have emotions such as guilt and shame. The most classic example is the “moral dilemma”. Taking <em>The Witcher 3</em> as an example, in the game, facing a woman who is heartbroken by the loss of her child, orphans who are suffering from hunger and cold, innocent villagers, and a wealthy but childless baron, no matter how the player chooses, they cannot save everyone. At this time, the player will inevitably feel the gap between the actual self and the ought self, and then generate the above emotions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/0425ab60-ce7a-4430-bc61-dd5c697a844b.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The classic Bloody Baron quest in “The Witcher 3”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another classic case is <em>This War of Mine</em>. There is no difficulty option in this game. The difficulty of clearing the game is more based on the player’s code of conduct. Players can choose the human mode: take in every defector, help everyone who asks for help, don’t take a needle or thread from the masses… But the consequence of this is often to increase the difficulty of clearing the game, and eventually end in tragedy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/f6ab6d9d-4ee6-4488-80a1-49acd68ca4c4.png"></p>
<p>The lack of supplies throughout the game forces players to choose “violent” methods to solve problems. When players choose to abandon moral constraints and have the mentality of “it’s just a game” and “the game must be cleared”, the game also becomes “easy”. So you break into the mansion of the old couple and loot their supplies, because you are about to run out of food; you start to sneak attack other survivors in the ruins and take their weapons and bullets, because you need weapons to protect yourself; you will decisively abandon the injured companion, because the soldiers next door are about to find this place; you will keep the child who came to ask for medicine out of the door, because only these supplies are left. But in fact, making these decisions is not easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/ebd12d6b-9526-4f82-930a-5b5d2994a575.png"></p>
<p>In the face of such complex emotions, it is often difficult for people to make decisions. The reason why it is difficult is because people’s emotions are deeply touched and they experience the difficulty of choice. Therefore, designing complex emotional experiences, grasping the complex emotional factors in people’s hearts, and creating a difficult situation are very important in game design.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when there is a gap between the actual self and the ideal self, people tend to have emotions such as frustration and disappointment towards themselves. These emotions are usually not strong, because people often fail to reach their ideal self. After these emotions often appear, they will also begin to become numb.</p>
<p>So is the gap between the actual self and the ideal self not able to be used to generate strong emotions? Of course not, because conversely, once this gap is crossed and the ideal self is reached, people will feel great joy, satisfaction, and pride. These powerful and very positive emotions will also be addictive. “The bigger the gap crossed, the greater the emotional fluctuation”.</p>
<h3 id="Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion"><a href="#Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Sublimate Experience with Emotion"></a>Sublimate Experience with Emotion</h3><p>So now the question is how to create this huge gap?</p>
<p>Self-sacrifice is a good way. Regarding self-sacrifice, the writer Somerset Maugham has a wonderful description in <em>The Razor’s Edge</em>: “Self-sacrifice is an overwhelming emotion. Even lust and hunger are insignificant compared to it. It makes people make the highest evaluation of their personality and drives people to destruction. It can be worthwhile, or it can be worthless. No wine is so intoxicating, no love is so destructive, and no sin is so irresistible. When sacrificing oneself, one instantly becomes greater than God.”</p>
<p>The most amazing game that incorporates “self-sacrifice” and allows players to complete the leap of the ideal self is <em>Nier: Automata</em>. In the ending of <em>Nier: Automata</em>, the task difficulty of the player fighting the production team is designed to be very large. But when the player is about to be shot down, they will see messages from all players in the world, encouraging you to persevere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/b7c86e61-363f-4145-97a3-7932d2f1351a.png"></p>
<p>Then, you find that your plane is protected by 6 wingmen. Each plane is a player’s save file. Being shot down means that the save file is lost. In this process, you will feel the kindness from all over the world. So many players are willing to sacrifice their save files just to block a bullet for a stranger. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/58a1fe74-fba6-489c-98ab-a4531b40e9ea.png"></p>
<p>After clearing the game, the game also gives players the opportunity to sacrifice themselves, but it is not a simple and direct option. This design is particularly clever. First, it allows players to leave messages, just like they were encouraged before, to encourage other players who are in a hard battle, immediately allowing players to complete the role transition from the helped to the helper. Then step by step, through a series of questions, the meaning of the player’s self-sacrifice is enhanced.</p>
<p>“Are you going to save the weak?” “Are you sure you want to use all your data to save someone you don’t know?” “That person may be someone you hate, are you still willing to do this?” “The chapters and functions you have worked so hard to unlock will also be unavailable, are you still willing to do this?” “In fact, you may not be thanked for doing this, you may be seen as hypocritical, are you still willing to do this?” Every time the player clicks [Yes], they reach an ideal self. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/4c65af59-145e-4d66-9d27-227eba7ac39a.png"></p>
<p>This ending always controls the player’s emotions, appropriately uses the player’s “self-sacrifice” emotions, makes the player feel “participating in a great cause”, and thus generates a high evaluation of their own morality, reaching the “ideal self” in their heart, and completely deepening the experience of the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Designers create a real game world through various methods. The purpose of various gameplay, systems, and level settings is also to allow players to better immerse themselves in it, satisfy players’ various fantasies in real society, play the role of a hero to kill dragons, and play the role of a knight to save the world. Everything is to allow players to feel the beauty of the virtual world, gradually gain self-identification, emotional catharsis, and communication and resonance with others in the process of experiencing the game.</p>
