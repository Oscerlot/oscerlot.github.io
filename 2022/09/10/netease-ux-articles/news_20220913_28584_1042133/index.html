<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the Mid-Autumn Festival again, one of China’s four traditional festivals, and it also represents reunion. Throughout history, people have often used the “waxing and waning of the moon” to contrast “joys and sorrows, partings and reunions.” Su Shi’s “Prelude to Water Melody” uses the line “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” to give the Mid-Autumn Festival a unique romance and the theme of expecting reunion.  Even today, the main folk activities of the Mid-Autumn Festival still revolve around the theme of “reunion.” What does a happy ending look like in games? And why do players always crave a happy ending?</p>
<h2 id="1-HE-or-BE"><a href="#1-HE-or-BE" class="headerlink" title="1. HE or BE?"></a>1. HE or BE?</h2><p>When we browse Weibo (Chinese Twitter), we can always see many trending topics about popular dramas, usually in the format of “#XXX reveals that the ending of XX is HE#.” The ending of every popular film and television work triggers huge discussions, and it seems that the audience’s demand for HE (Happy Ending) is becoming stronger and stronger. When “Love Between Fairy and Devil” was broadcast, many fans were very concerned about whether “Dongfang Qingcang” and “Little Orchid” could have an HE, and they were relieved only after seeing the two together in the finale.</p>
<p>Although the terms HE and BE that we see now often appear in film and television dramas, these abbreviations actually originated from the gaming circle, especially in AVG games with multiple endings and multiple branches. However, many 3A masterpieces now also provide different plot choices. For example, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, different feedback from each dialogue of the protagonist will open different branch plots, which in turn will affect different endings. Of course, interactive movie games are more typical. For example, in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, the ending of the story depends entirely on the player’s choices, and there are countless branch plots in the middle. It is difficult for players to repeatedly play the same ending, which also dilutes the concept of HE and BE. Now it is difficult to define the different endings of a game with the traditional binary opposition definition, just like “Tian Long Ba Bu” (Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils), where “everyone is wronged, and all who are affectionate are sinful.” The labels of HE&#x2F;BE are now difficult to use to summarize the ending of a game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/c44dfd52-588d-4aad-8591-58a1cefc025f.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>AVG games are still sought after by many players</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the more ancient and once-popular text adventure games, HE and BE were still hot topics that players would always pay attention to. Even in addition to HE and BE, text adventure game enthusiasts would also discuss TE (True End) and NE (Normal End), but at present, these two labels are obviously only applicable to the game field. TE is the so-called “true ending,” which is a real ending that players believe is superior to other endings. It often requires players to complete all other endings before they have the opportunity to unlock TE, and other endings will automatically “degenerate” to NE.</p>
<p>As an extension of text, in the field of online literature, HB&#x2F;BE even directly form a label-based screening process. If it is BE, there will be a “risk warning” before reading. Of course, readers can also filter it out in advance, so that they can read it clearly.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?"></a>2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?</h2><p>Returning to the topic of games, although multiple endings have now become the choice of many games, most mainstream games still have linear plots, and it is not difficult to list the happy endings in games.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>It Takes Two</em> is not complicated.  It roughly goes: “In the game, the little girl hears that her parents have decided to divorce, and she is heartbroken and prays to Dr. Hakim that they will not separate. With the help of the doctor and his guidance, the souls of the parents are transferred to two dolls, and they reluctantly begin an adventure in the magical world, trying to return to their original bodies. The two experience various hardships and dangers together, and after taking four lessons from Dr. Hakim, they gradually find their original sincere feelings and decide not to separate. So the spell is broken, and the family of three lives happily ever after.. </p>

<p><em>Mending a broken mirror is the biggest theme of the plot of “It Takes Two”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another masterpiece ported to PC, <em>Days Gone</em>, tells a story in the apocalypse. Facing the zombie siege, the protagonist and his brother and girlfriend, the three of them flee together. The girlfriend and brother are seriously injured, and the rescue helicopter that is about to take off cannot carry three people. In the end, the protagonist and his brother choose to stay, and the girlfriend successfully boards the rescue helicopter.</p>
<p>After the two escaped, they found the medical camp where the helicopter landed, but found that it had already been looted by zombies. Although they did not find the girlfriend’s body, the protagonist desperately believed that she had passed away, and felt self-blame and regret for it. Until one day, he accidentally discovered the possibility of his girlfriend’s miraculous survival, and then drove north, going through all kinds of hardships, and finally reunited with his girlfriend. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The protagonist reunites with his girlfriend at the end</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for giving examples of these two games, in addition to their happy endings, is another characteristic, that is, they have all experienced the plot of “loss and recovery,” experiencing ups and downs, rather than being smooth from beginning to end. Such a plot setting often gives players a more gratifying feeling and releases more positive signals.</p>
<p>A psychological counseling supervisor once mentioned that when members of a mutual aid group shared their experiences of loss and recovery, some positive signals were often released along with them. For example, a member found a wallet that had been lost a long time ago in an unexpected place before participating in the group activity, so he suddenly said during the sharing that he felt he had the energy to clean up the house, and everything was developing in a good direction. This is a phenomenon of synchronicity in analytical psychology. When something happens internally, the external world also presents similar signals to us in some way.</p>
<h2 id="3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending"><a href="#3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending" class="headerlink" title="3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?"></a>3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?</h2><p>In fact, the title reveals everything. “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” is preceded by “People have joys and sorrows, partings and reunions; the moon waxes and wanes, is bright or dim: these things have always been this way since time immemorial (人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全 - rén yǒu bēi huān lí hé, yuè yǒu yīn qíng yuán quē, cǐ shì gǔ nán quán)”.  Games, like movies, are immersive experiences. Players will put themselves into the role and have empathy.</p>
<p>You can try to recall the Spring Festival of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly in an unimaginable way, and you and I around you, and even the entire society, experienced a huge psychological shock. Seeing various negative emotions on the Internet, many people will have a feeling of discomfort, which we call “empathic exhaustion.”</p>
<p>An excellent game can create a traversal game space with high degrees of freedom and more options, providing players with a very in-depth interactive experience from the structure and mechanism. But what really attracts players to continue playing is the story that integrates traversal selection and interactive narrative techniques, as well as the story content that players personally participate in telling. In the immersive plot of about 10-20 hours, we experience everything that the game characters experience. If we are really allowed to repeatedly lose one partner after another, and repeat one BE after another, we will be in a state of intense mental fatigue: once we start to walk into the pain of others, it is difficult to stop continuing to feel the pain, and it is also difficult to get out of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/c3ba16d7-bb91-40be-86fe-637b7b9f4975.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The author’s mental state was also affected by empathy when experiencing “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a social perspective, in fact, many people in real life are engaged in “professional helping” industries, such as doctors, psychological counselors, etc. They often need to undergo very professional related training before they can be licensed to work. For example, psychological counselors need to follow supervisors to handle a large number of cases, and colleagues also need to discuss regularly with each other to avoid empathic exhaustion caused by trying to establish emotional connections with patients. And with the deepening of medical training, in many cases, their ability to empathize with patients will decrease, and even empathy钝化 (dùnhuà, blunting) will occur. Research also shows that compared with practitioners in the music, science, and finance industries, professional helpers are more likely to have substance abuse problems, which means… they also collapse.</p>
<p>But players will not undergo any professional training. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Abby’s use of a golf club to torture and kill Joel made many players feel quite uncomfortable. In the previous work, players spent a lot of time feeling and believing in two pitiful people who lost their families. Even if there is no blood relationship between the two, they can support each other like a real father and daughter, fighting against the entire wasteland world. But in the sequel, Joel is brutally killed, and even many people are unbelievable when they play this plot. Unlike the general film and television drama bridges where the protagonist is shot or falls off a cliff and there is still a chance, Joel, who was hit multiple times on the head with a golf club, is completely offline and cannot be saved. Many players also said that no matter which perspective they substitute, this ending is ultimately difficult to accept.</p>
<p>After a huge disaster, we can easily distinguish who are firefighters and police officers from the crowd - because they are the only ones who rush to the scene when everyone else is staying away from the disaster scene. But as players of ordinary characters, we just want to stay away from the traumatic experience scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20220913/3419396a-18de-4ad0-88aa-cdf283102176.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The duo in Part 1 experienced life and death in Part 2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, rather than saying why we want to see a happy ending, it’s better to say that players don’t want to see others suffering during a long period of immersion. To put it simply, players don’t want to be sad, players don’t want to be upset. Social psychology has learned a beautiful world expectation, which roughly means that in order to give the whole world a sense of meaning, people tend to believe that the world is beautiful. That being the case, why embrace a miserable world?</p>
