<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sports games have always been an important category in the global game market, and can be said to be a game genre that has run through a considerable period of history in the field of video games. No matter how the hardware environment changes or how the game market trends change, this type of theme has never been outdated. FIFA, NBA 2K, Pro Evolution Soccer, etc., these familiar and popular sports games for many gamers, also fully demonstrate the value of sports games.</p>
<p>For players, sports games can be regarded as a kind of casual game, occasionally playing a game of competition, or as a development game, where you can cultivate your favorite teams, players, etc.; and sports games also have the passion of fair competition that all games do not have, which is exciting. In foreign countries, the potential of the sports game market can be said to have been fully exploited, but in China, the situation seems to be not optimistic. With a large number of sports users, the corresponding market has been lukewarm, and the mobile game aspect is even worse. It seems that sports games have not yet found their track. Even big IPs from console platforms such as NBA 2K and FIFA have not been able to fully awaken the sports mobile game market.</p>
<p>Since the prospect of the sports game market is so promising and has been so stable for many years, why are there so few sports games that can stand out in China’s popular mobile game market?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products"><a href="#1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products" class="headerlink" title="1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products"></a>1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products</h2><p>The direction of users’ attention determines the preference of developers and publishers for theme selection. The audience of global major sports events is undoubtedly concentrated in football, and the NBA, as one of the most popular sports events, also has a large audience. When it comes to games, football and basketball games are also the two most numerous sports game categories. Unlike other forms of entertainment, sports are more likely to inspire people’s passion and even generate emotional attachment.</p>
<p>However, in China, compared with other game categories, there have always been relatively few sports games on the market. This is related to the characteristics of sports games themselves. Sports games such as FIFA, Pro Evolution Soccer, NBA 2K, and NBA LIVE all have very distinct labels: professional.</p>
<p>This is mainly reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, most of the fans of sports games are themselves fans or fans of the sport, and non-fans rarely get involved; on the other hand, sports games have a high threshold for research and development, such as physical collisions, operating feel, adaptation engines, player AI, etc., which also greatly increases the difficulty of research and development.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About"><a href="#2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About" class="headerlink" title="2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?"></a>2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?</h2><p>Why is such a big cake, but the actual performance is not satisfactory?</p>
<h3 id="Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization"><a href="#Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization" class="headerlink" title="Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization"></a>Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization</h3><p>Because sports games rely on sports events, their basic gameplay is nothing more than PVP (player-to-player) around the event, especially in mobile games, which is also the most acceptable mode for most players. However, monotonous gameplay will accelerate boredom, and PVP is not a permanent solution. Production teams often enrich the player experience by adding game modes. However, the harsh reality is that no matter what kind of attempt, it cannot solve the fundamental problem of the game. Most players will still choose the most basic PVP mode. Of course, there are also many players who will play against the computer on console sports games.</p>
<p>In addition, the emergence of highly homogeneous products is also a need for market competition. When a manufacturer launches a new model, other manufacturers will subsequently “copy” one. After all, they are games of the same category, and they cannot let competitors have something they don’t have, so the products on the market are developing in an increasingly similar direction. Under such circumstances, when the gameplay of sports games is too monotonous and the homogenization of sports games is strong, the potential of the entire sports game market will naturally be difficult to explode.</p>
<h3 id="Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation"><a href="#Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation"></a>Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation</h3><p>For sports game players, whether they are basketball fans or football fans, or fans of other sports, most of them continue to invest their energy in the game in order to continue the feeling of sweating on the field of their favorite sports, or to experience the operations that cannot be realized in real life in the game. In this way, even if our bodies are exhausted, we can still enjoy spiritual happiness. Therefore, sports players do not have a variety of types to choose from in terms of game selection like other players. They generally only play according to their sports hobbies. Even if new games appear, as long as they have nothing to do with their favorite projects, I am afraid they will not pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>In addition, for sports games that focus on operational confrontation, in order to reproduce the feel of the game on the real field through virtual programs and find a feeling of being on the scene, even if their operation methods are simplified, the operation difficulty is still higher than other competitive games, and it requires continuous improvement of self-operation to complete the game process to obtain a higher sense of accomplishment. Because there is a certain operational threshold, many mobile game players who are mainly casual will naturally not pay special attention to such games.</p>
<h3 id="Prone-to-Imbalance"><a href="#Prone-to-Imbalance" class="headerlink" title="Prone to Imbalance"></a>Prone to Imbalance</h3><p>The key to the gameplay of sports games lies in operating skills. The importance of skills in such games is self-evident. Its design will not only affect novice players, but also affect the operating manufacturers.</p>
<p>If the gameplay skills of a video game become very important, this will lead to many players being unwilling to spend money to buy game props. Most players will have such an idea: “Anyway, I can defeat my opponent with my ability, why bother spending that money”.</p>
<p>In this case, ordinary props are no longer attractive. In order to strive for a better return on investment in the limited business model of sports competitive games, games may launch more props that enhance attributes; and over time, the amplitude of attribute enhancement will become larger and larger, but this is the beginning of a game losing its balance. When more and more players spend a lot of money to buy high-attribute props, it may cause a group of players who enjoy fair competition to leave the game, because on the premise of relatively close skills, the improvement of props to attributes is like an insurmountable gap, which creates a serious vicious circle: “Reduction in the number of players - Difficulties in the income of agents - Agents make money on attribute props - Game imbalance”. In the end, it will become the original sin of player churn.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Do-Players-Want"><a href="#3-What-Do-Players-Want" class="headerlink" title="3. What Do Players Want?"></a>3. What Do Players Want?</h2><p>What kind of game do players who come from sports competitions need?</p>
<p>Looking at people who love sports, they have many things in common - love sports, pay attention to competitions, have a flamboyant personality, and trust teamwork. Therefore, if you want to capture the hearts of sports game users, you must start with professional needs, viewing needs, personality needs, and social needs.</p>
<p>Many players like to play the corresponding sports games of the projects they actually participate in in reality, because they want to replicate the feel of the hand&#x2F;foot in reality, or experience some elements that cannot be realized in actual sports projects. Therefore, to a certain extent, reasonably moving reality to the virtual world is always the pursuit of developers and players. In addition, some sports enthusiasts may not have been gamers before. The low threshold for getting started with the game, while having both technology and operational depth, can play a key role in expanding the player base, especially for mobile gamers. Of course, for some products that may not pursue IP, cool and gorgeous operations are always one of the biggest selling points to attract players: I wasn’t aiming for the players in the first place. If the actions are still plain, how can I be attracted? After all, for most gamers, the operation is only temporary, but being handsome is a lifetime.</p>
<p>In today’s era of increasingly developed hardware equipment, games with high-quality sound and pictures often have richer expressiveness and stronger appeal, and creating a sense of presence and immersion is also an important part of the game’s ability to attract players. Especially for sports games, the viewing value of the picture and action is more important. Regardless of whether it is related to sports feelings, or to IP and classic events, even if the audience is relatively fixed, the game also needs to arouse topics and awaken players’ attention. Players also hope to experience games with higher popularity.</p>
<h2 id="4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track"><a href="#4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track" class="headerlink" title="4. Opening Up a New Track?"></a>4. Opening Up a New Track?</h2><p>Even the best wine is not afraid of a deep alley. In the face of the dilemma of the sports game market, the quality of the game alone is not enough to break the situation. For a sports game, good game quality can attract fans of this series, but to seek breakthroughs, more sports enthusiasts and even sports pan-entertainment users need to know and accept it.</p>
<h3 id="Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events"><a href="#Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events" class="headerlink" title="Synchronous Operation with Physical Events"></a>Synchronous Operation with Physical Events</h3><p>If you want to expand the coverage, how to promote it has become a difficult problem. It is necessary to find effective brand exposure methods to build momentum for the game before or during the corresponding sports events to attract fans’ attention.</p>
<p>Use promotion methods that are synchronized with the operation period of sports events, and use platform resources in many aspects, not limited to game platforms. This will help to spread the influence of the game itself, so that users of multiple platforms will continue to increase their favorability of the game. Sports games themselves, as a category with a potentially huge user base, everyone, regardless of gender, age, likes sports, loves sports, but how to subdivide and differentiate users of this magnitude, and operate them in a refined manner, is worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="Creation-of-eSports-Event-System"><a href="#Creation-of-eSports-Event-System" class="headerlink" title="Creation of eSports Event System"></a>Creation of eSports Event System</h3><p>Create an event system, and then go out of the circle, so as to attract more fans to enter the game and increase player stickiness. For sports competitive games, on the basis of the current widespread e-sports alliance, we can try to build a complete sports game e-sports event system, while broadening the channels for public participation, and complete a larger scale of sinking and penetration; combined with community operation experience, promote “small community” type events in the game, making it easier for the public to participate in e-sports, and then introduce in-game events to offline communities.</p>
<p>For a sports game, the things that test people are definitely not just the above. In the final analysis, it is necessary to return to the game itself. How to design each stage of the game so that players do not have the fatigue of constantly repeating the season; how to set up players, how to let players play an unforgettable game, etc., these are also tricky. After all, the key to measuring an excellent sports game is to see whether it can narrow the distance between the game world and the real sports competition, and at the same time take into account the operability of the game, so that players can truly get an immersive and pleasant experience from the game.</p>
