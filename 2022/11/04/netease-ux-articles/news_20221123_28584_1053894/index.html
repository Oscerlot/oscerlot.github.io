<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In competitive games, normal players are deeply disgusted by cheaters. However, when some players are enjoying the game, they encounter obstacles that they cannot bypass, or hurdles they cannot overcome. There are always some people who will take the wrong path, using third-party software to modify game data, directly cheating, or cutting off the opponent’s network cable. The act of running third-party software is usually not only strongly condemned by the majority of players, but will also be severely punished by the game officials, ranging from warnings to account bans. However, in single-player games, players seem to be more tolerant of modifying game values, and prefer to call the “cheats” of single-player games “trainers”.</p>
<p>For example, a very popular meme among players is - Join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, which is a trainer for a cultivation game. Because the game randomly generates many plots, some players are repeatedly chased or robbed and want to vent their anger, while some players’ Taoist companions are killed and want revenge. At this time, some players will ask them to join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, that is, they suggest that the other party use a trainer. It seems that players are not resistant to this form, and even using it properly can enhance the game experience. So how should we correctly view and use trainers?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification"><a href="#1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification" class="headerlink" title="1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?"></a>1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?</h2><p>On Steam, many games have “Workshop”, in which there are many player-made and provided game Mods. Mod is taken from the first three letters of the word modification.</p>
<p>There are many types of Mods. Fashion Mods are used to change the appearance of characters. In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, players can use fashion Mods to turn themselves into various different characters. Map Mods can change the in-game map or directly create a new map. In <em>CS: GO</em>, there are many players who spontaneously form community servers to play hide-and-seek modes that are not available on official servers. There are also many other game content Mods such as sound effects and skills. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/1d879bc3-00e9-4283-9255-2c285db4be54.jpg" alt="Human Fall Flat, players use Mods to create custom skins"></p>
<p>The production of these contents is essentially a modification of the game. The existence of Mods is to increase the game content and allow players to experience things outside the game itself, and the continued popularity of many games is also due to the large number of Mods. Some people may think of DLC here, the content of which is similar to some Mods. To distinguish Mods from game DLC, Mods can be understood more as content spontaneously produced and released by players, and they are generally free to use. However, due to technical limitations, they may have some compatibility issues with the game or other Mods. DLC is officially produced and launched game expansion content, which usually requires payment to experience, and is naturally more compatible and stable than player-made Mods. </p>
<p>![Portal 2, players create custom map Mods and provide them to other players for experience](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/861d5ada-d8df-425c-9c0e-d0d0c80a11ff.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/861d5ada-d8df-425c-9c0e-d0d0c80a11ff.png</a>. </p>

<p>Compared with Mods, “game trainers” focus more violently on modifying game values and reducing game difficulty, so the functions are relatively simple and crude, with a list of several shortcut keys, players only need to move their fingers to completely subvert the game values. Common functions in trainers include infinite health, infinite mana, infinite money, and so on. I believe some people can still skillfully type Panzer, the cheat code for summoning tanks.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?"></a>2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?</h2><p>Different players may have very different pursuits and goals after entering the game, and these are also highly related to their different game experiences. In past research, we have summarized some reasons why players use trainers, and classified them.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Game-Difficulty"><a href="#Reduce-Game-Difficulty" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Game Difficulty"></a>Reduce Game Difficulty</h3><p>It is undeniable that many players have strong talents in gaming and can easily clear many difficult games. However, according to the player ability grading theory, these talented players only occupy a very small part of the top of the player pyramid. We can call them pro-gamers, some of whom are even close to the level of e-sports players. However, there are still many players whose game level is not so high, and the number of these players is much larger, and the overall ability level is also at the middle of the ability grading pyramid. They have certain operating strengths, but often want to experience more games in their spare time. However, the difficulty of some games is too high, and the outward ability performance based on experience and strength may not match this difficulty, which will cause them to spend a lot of time looking up guides, learning skills, and polishing moves.</p>
<p>However, leisure is their biggest purpose in playing games, not becoming stronger. Especially in single-player games, the appearance of trainers can help them experience the full content of the game more easily. Although the core content of some high-difficulty games is to experience hardship and become stronger little by little, if a player cannot persist in playing, then the follow-up of this game will have nothing to do with this player, including carefully crafted content such as plot stories, visual effects, and background music. </p>

<h3 id="Experience-Different-Game-Content"><a href="#Experience-Different-Game-Content" class="headerlink" title="Experience Different Game Content"></a>Experience Different Game Content</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, many game Mods or trainers can add a lot of new content for players to experience, even player-made BOSSes and side quests. The famous blacksmithing game <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> was released in 2019 and is still popular today. Some players are not satisfied with the normal + double difficulty content of the game itself, so some players have created a series of high-difficulty Mods such as Resurrection, Nightmare, and Gauntlets of Strength, among which Gauntlets of Strength even adds two side quests that are not in the main game. These game Mods have modified the difficulty of the game, added more moves to the BOSS, and allowed hardcore players to experience a cooler and more challenging <em>Sekiro</em>. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/1790b6c1-fd60-41e2-89b0-11e7d98d662a.png" alt="Sekiro Gauntlets of Strength Mod"></p>
<h3 id="“Protect-the-Liver”"><a href="#“Protect-the-Liver”" class="headerlink" title="“Protect the Liver”"></a>“Protect the Liver”</h3><p>Many RPG games have some extremely “grindy” tasks. These tasks either have extremely high material quantity requirements, or have difficulty and drop rate bottlenecks. Players often need to complete a large number of repetitive and boring farming processes to complete these tasks. Some players may not have any complaints about this repetitive step-by-step collection, but there are also players who do not like this boring collection process, and trainers can help players shorten the boring and repetitive game process, and can also provide some rest for the player’s “liver”.</p>
<p>For these players, the appearance of trainers is undoubtedly a godsend. The Japanese RPG game <em>Octopath Traveler</em> has a game mechanism where enemies may be encountered when moving, and the level limit is tied to the experience of the game plot. Players must repeat the mechanical farming and leveling to experience more of the plot, which makes many players call out that they are “tired”. Trainers can save some farming and leveling time for players who only want to experience the plot. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/bdbd84bd-42b2-4121-9c31-ad78a348c8e2.png" alt="Octopath Traveler"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Game-More-Personalized"><a href="#Make-the-Game-More-Personalized" class="headerlink" title="Make the Game More Personalized"></a>Make the Game More Personalized</h3><p>Different players will have different preferences for game content, and game makers are not omnipotent and cannot cover the preferences of most players. Trainers can provide players with a “superpower” to quickly skip content they don’t like, allowing players to customize their personalized experience and focus more on the “boutique” content they really like to play.</p>
<h2 id="3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats"><a href="#3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats" class="headerlink" title="3. Trainers VS Game Cheats"></a>3. Trainers VS Game Cheats</h2><p>As mentioned at the beginning, many players are more tolerant of modifying game values in single-player games. This is the biggest difference between trainers and cheats - whether your behavior affects others, and whether your happiness is at the expense of other players’ gaming experience. The author believes that using trainers in single-player games only changes the game experience of the user alone. Whether it is increasing the difficulty or simplifying the process, most of them only affect the user himself; while using trainers in multiplayer battle mode will affect the game experience of everyone in the same game, and building one’s own happiness on the pain of others is extremely unfair to other players. Here, the multiplayer battle mode not only refers to the online multiplayer mode, but also content that is related to and competes with other players can be regarded as multiplayer mode, such as game leaderboards, speedruns, achievement acquisition, etc. Using trainers and other improper means to participate in this kind of competition will also not be recognized. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/0ee7bcca-c1f8-4dc6-b211-0b4f75d05846.png" alt="Using the official trainer in Dead Cells will lock achievements"></p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers"><a href="#Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers"></a>Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Improper use will greatly accelerate the consumption speed of game content.</strong> When using trainers, direct numerical modifications should be reduced, and instead, some disliked game content should be reduced from the side. Different types of games have different core content. When using trainers, try to ensure that the core gameplay is not affected or is less affected. When experiencing survival games, when the player’s survival materials reach a level that cannot be used up, then the meaning of “survival” is lost. Therefore, in such games, try not to use trainers with unlimited resources; and when experiencing combat games, using trainers with unlimited health will distort the core experience of such games. The skipped process should be content that is meaningless to the user, not the core content of the game, to prevent the situation of being “invincible” but only being happy for half an hour, and then the whole game becomes boring.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221123/f3a4a249-3426-44fd-8307-25c711b2f47b.png" alt="The Dead Cells official trainer can choose the number of revives"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is easy to develop a dependence on trainers.</strong> The function of trainers is very powerful. Players only need to move their fingers to operate simple key combinations to solve almost all problems in the game. Such a simple and crude means of winning is easy to make people psychologically dependent. In fact, every time you use a trainer, you need to carefully consider which things should really be skipped with the trainer, so as to maximize the overall game experience. Excessive dependence and overuse of trainers can also easily make you miss important experiences and core fun points, and lose interest in the games that you originally expected and downloaded to play.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In order to obtain a “better” gaming experience, it is the original intention of most players to use trainers. In various game playthrough videos, there will be many “cloud players” who only watch game live videos and do not experience the game themselves. Some of them are because they don’t have time to grind, and some are because they are “handicapped” and can’t beat the game, so they can only see the excitement of the game in the video. Trainers do not have to be a target of criticism, but a tool that can be used well to help some players better enjoy the game. For players, if they can get more fun without affecting others, it is a successful modification.</p>
