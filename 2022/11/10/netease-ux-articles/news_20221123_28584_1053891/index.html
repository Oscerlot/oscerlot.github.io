<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the game market develops, various games are constantly seeking new gameplay and game mechanics, striving to bring players novel and high-quality experiences. Game mechanics are like thousands of ways of arranging and combining various game elements, and they are gradually moving towards a more complex direction.</p>
<p>If a game is a process where players voluntarily overcome unnecessary obstacles, then how can we design interactions to make players willing to pay for these unnecessary obstacles instead of feeling bored? This article will elaborate on this in detail.</p>
<h2 id="1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="1. Starting with Game Mechanics"></a>1. Starting with Game Mechanics</h2><p>In Wikipedia, the description of game mechanics is as follows: In tabletop games and video games, game mechanics are constructs of rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state, thus providing gameplay. In other words, the mechanics of the game effectively regulate how the game will serve the person playing the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, this concept can perhaps be divided into two parts: “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics.” The former represents the player’s actual operation when using the device, such as “pressing WASD on the keyboard respectively”; while the latter is the corresponding action of the virtual character in the game, such as “the game protagonist walks in various directions respectively.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Ff3f5f4e6-b559-4a5a-a0a9-db70af47ac1d.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Just Dance 2》| Rasputin - Boney M. | Gameplay</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is high, players do not need to spend too much energy on the conversion mechanism between real operation and virtual feedback. For example, in the <em>Just Dance</em> series, the actions of the virtual characters are consistent with the player’s real actions, so players do not need to think about “what kind of actions do I need to perform to get a higher score?” They just need to imitate the characters in the game, so the playability of this game is high. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fa995ed01-2602-4a8c-86b9-52b24cf45141.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Longsword Advanced Aerial Combo</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is not high, the playability of the game decreases, but it also brings more room for operation. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, in order for the character to execute the appropriate combo, the player needs to press a series of buttons at the appropriate time nodes in order to realize the conversion of real actions to virtual character actions, which has higher requirements for the player’s various comprehensive operations. In this kind of more complex game mechanics, how to create high playability is a test that designers must face.</p>
<p>“Playing a game” is “voluntarily overcoming unnecessary obstacles.” — Bernard Suits, <em>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</em></p>
<p>As the game market continues to expand, the game’s mechanisms have also become more complex in permutation and combination. How to make players voluntarily accept these complex mechanisms in the game? This requires interaction design to communicate “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics”, efficiently complete the interaction between players and the game, that is, the game will give feedback in time according to the player’s input, helping players make operations in the most friendly and effective way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics"></a>2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics</h2><p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, mentioned earlier, includes game mechanics such as scenes, teams, actions, confrontations, matching, and skills. Therefore, this section mainly uses the combat content of this game as an example to illustrate the role of interaction in complex mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics"><a href="#Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics"></a>Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics</h3><p>First of all, the most straightforward auxiliary explanation is the familiar “novice tutorial.” In games, it is very efficient and necessary to use the novice tutorial method for interaction with core or unfamiliar mechanics. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, because its combat contains a lot of information, in addition to the common team and poison elements of battle royale games, it also contains many hero characteristics, souljades and other content.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the novice tutorial, the UI of the interface is unfolded in sequence. It can be seen that the initial interface of the novice tutorial only contains basic information, orientation, and map information that players are familiar with, while other content will appear with corresponding UI information as the tutorial unfolds. This is to allow players to gradually understand the game’s combat mechanics, and try to avoid players experiencing frustration and resistance when encountering too much complex information. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Novice Tutorial, after guiding the player to pick up a weapon and introducing related content, the weapon-related UI in the lower right corner appears.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The novice tutorial of this game can be opened by yourself when selecting the mode on the homepage, providing a quick entry to the novice tutorial, which is also a common method for games with more complex mechanics. However, games with simpler mechanics are more likely to enter the tutorial directly when entering the game for the first time, and no tutorial entry will be provided after that. In addition, no matter whether the novice tutorial mechanism is simple or complex, it is generally necessary to provide players with a channel to “exit&#x2F;skip” the tutorial immediately, such as pressing the Esc key at any time in the tutorial to return to the lobby.</p>
<h3 id="Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles"><a href="#Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles" class="headerlink" title="Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles"></a>Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles</h3><p>The medium of player interaction in complex mechanics is almost still the keyboard and mouse or the controller, and the moves of the characters in the game in combat are very complex, so most of the abstract mechanics and concrete mechanics in combat are very dissimilar. To improve the playability experience of the game, interaction design can try to add concrete elements to abstract mechanisms to increase the similarity between abstract mechanisms and concrete mechanisms psychologically, so as to obtain a better immersive experience and playability experience.</p>
<p>For example, when using the grappling hook item in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players and the keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;controller obviously cannot interact like the grappling hook and the character, but the aiming feedback that appears after pressing the “Q” key, and the fixed feedback of the rope flying out after clicking the mouse, all improve the player’s playability experience through the concrete UI. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fb3af826c-3087-470d-a544-3749e412d68c.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 When using the grappling hook in the game, press “Q” and the aiming interaction feedback appears.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, sometimes in order to increase the challenge of the game, the game will adopt the opposite abstract and concrete mechanisms. At this time, it is very important to let players feel the rationality of the interaction method in the interface. Because essentially, this is the player voluntarily giving up the means to quickly achieve the goal, and voluntarily accepting certain restrictions, choosing a “low-efficiency” way to participate in the game.</p>
<p>For example, in the segment of driving a wooden boat in <em>It Takes Two</em>, when the player controlling Cody sprays honey backwards, the effect of spraying to the left is that the wooden boat moves to the right. At this time, the direction of the player’s operation and the direction of the wooden boat are opposite, but in the interface, the form of Cody spraying honey at the tail as power allows the player to understand the logic of the opposite operation and voluntarily accept this setting that increases the difficulty. This is the same principle in its famous airplane flying segment. </p>

<ul>
<li>Highlight the central area of the screen, leaving enough vision for combat;</li>
<li>Various combat information is classified and integrated, distributed in appropriate positions around the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fc1fae52b-7a9b-4c5b-acad-5e3567e503a8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Combat Interface Information Layout</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Here, in the combat interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the clotting salve, armor powder, and weapon box, which are also props, are displayed in different blocks, also out of consideration of content relevance, so that players can consider whether to use the weapon box to repair the weapon while paying attention to the weapon durability in the lower right corner, facilitating the player’s interaction process. In addition, there is a special key prompt block in this interface, and there are key icons at the skills, weapons, and map, also in order to make it easier for players to fight in complex mechanisms through efficient and reasonable interaction.</p>
<p>Complex game mechanics have limited the conditions for players to achieve game victory. The work of interaction design needs to facilitate players so that they can voluntarily accept these constraints and enjoy them. The classification and integration of information is very important here. Efficient information presentation enables players in the game to quickly retrieve the information they need on the screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F819d980e-0d7a-4199-b2c4-9c71c7be9c4c.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Replacing-Text-with-Images-Sounds-Serving-the-Player’s-Efficient-Information-Acquisition-Experience"><a href="#Replacing-Text-with-Images-Sounds-Serving-the-Player’s-Efficient-Information-Acquisition-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Replacing Text with Images&#x2F;Sounds: Serving the Player’s Efficient Information Acquisition Experience"></a>Replacing Text with Images&#x2F;Sounds: Serving the Player’s Efficient Information Acquisition Experience</h3><p>In fact, the core of “replacing text with images&#x2F;sounds” and “efficient arrangement of HUD information” is the same, that is, to achieve efficient information reading for players through the interactive interface and sound effects. Images are symbolic languages that are easier for people to process than text, and there are almost no localization differences; while the interaction of sound does not need to occupy additional vision in the interface.</p>
<p>Also taking the presentation of skill and prop information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example. The UI of the ultimate skill CD is the icon of Viper Ning, and the surrounding circular progress bar and the Arabic numerals above quickly inform the player of the CD status. After the CD is completed, the outer glow effect and key prompts appear, and at the same time, it is matched with the in-game character voice prompt. The visual presentation part is efficient and cross-language, and the auditory part is efficient and extremely immediate. This interactive presentation is very efficient, and it also connects different states of the UI, thereby building a user experience that serves the player. </p>

<h3 id="Hidden-Information-Reduce-the-Presence-of-Some-UIs-to-Prevent-Information-Overload"><a href="#Hidden-Information-Reduce-the-Presence-of-Some-UIs-to-Prevent-Information-Overload" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Information: Reduce the Presence of Some UIs to Prevent Information Overload"></a>Hidden Information: Reduce the Presence of Some UIs to Prevent Information Overload</h3><p>Complex game mechanics are often accompanied by a more complex information processing process for players. For example, adding a “character” mechanism to ordinary battle royale game mechanics requires attention to the character characteristics of oneself and the opponent in the game; adding “skills” and “ranged&#x2F;melee weapons” mechanisms is accompanied by the necessary presentation of skill and weapon information in the game. However, if too much information is presented in the interface, it is easy to make players daunting at the initial contact, or it is difficult to find the point where the line of sight needs to be focused in the game.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in the presentation of weapon-related information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the visual effect is weakened by increasing the transparency of weapons that are equipped but not in use, which can more intuitively display the selected state of the weapon, and also save valuable screen vision. Hiding information does not mean reducing information, but making hidden information display when needed. The same is true for pop-up windows and folded pages in various game interfaces. Players do not need to see it directly on the main interface, they just need to be able to open it smoothly and independently when needed. </p>

<p>When do you notice the presence of the UI during the game? - When the game UI is done very poorly.</p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is almost a UI-less interface. Only a prompt or icon will appear on the screen, but players do not feel that there is too little information or that the operation is not smooth in the game, which is also an effective hiding of information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F68d4c4f4-a491-4bb8-9375-8816e598b11c.jpg/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Playability, also known as gameplay, reflects the impact of all internal components of the game on the player’s gaming experience, and the components can include game rules, game interaction with the player, game challenges and difficulty, etc., that is, “what players can do.” In other words, the reason why a game can become a game is precisely because it has playability, allowing players to obtain fun in its limited mechanisms.</p>
<p>For the presentation of game mechanics, the UI is the player’s “mechanism translator”; for the playability of the game, the UI is the player’s “operation helper”. Whether it is game workers or players, they will be excited about more and wider unknown game mechanics. How to better interpret the new composite game mechanics and how to let the mechanics bring players a high-quality experience are difficult problems that UI design needs to consider.</p>
