<h2 id="1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games"></a>1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games</h2><p>“Red dot notifications,” as a simple and eye-catching reminder, are ubiquitous on today’s smart device platforms. It can attract everyone’s attention with a strong visual presentation in the interface, convey the content of the prompt information, especially in the multi-level menu jump, it can also clearly guide the user, and it is the key to attracting users to obtain information. It can be seen that the role of the little red dot is self-evident. There is a big role hidden in the small red dot. In fact, “little red dot” is our popular and vivid term, and its official name is “Badge.” So, what is a badge?</p>
<p>A badge refers to a red dot, number, or text that usually appears in the upper right corner of an icon or text, indicating that there is new content or information to be processed. Its purpose is to guide users to operate and increase clicks, thereby increasing business exposure. A small number of red dots can provide effective information prompts for everyone, but when red dots appear all over the screen, it will become a disaster for obsessive-compulsives.</p>
<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones"></a>Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones</h3><p>There are many theories about the origin of the little red dot badge, but the most widely accepted theory is that the badge originated from the BlackBerry mobile phone system. In 2009, in the 9700 series mobile phones launched by BlackBerry, a small red dot with an asterisk (*) appeared in its system. Later, in 2013, Apple used the small red dot in its system and registered related patents. Since then, the small red dot has been carried forward in the iPhone. Later, the Android system also adopted the visual presentation of the “little red dot”. Until today, we have become accustomed to the appearance of the little red dot. </p>

<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Games"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Games"></a>Little Red Dots in Games</h3><p>In games, in order to effectively remind players to pay attention to function activation, content updates, reward collection, mail notifications, and other information, game developers are also very fond of small red dots, wishing that the interface was full of red dots. Even for players, playing games every day is to regularly clear the refreshed small red dots.</p>
<p>Of course, in the game, the more red dots, the better. If red dots appear all over the screen, it will make players feel confused, unable to distinguish the importance of the information conveyed, and confused. It will also strongly force players to eliminate a large number of red dots, causing players to be bored and reducing the game experience. </p>

<h2 id="2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot"><a href="#2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot" class="headerlink" title="2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot"></a>2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot</h2><h3 id="From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?"></a>From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?</h3><p>The eye-catching way of the small red dot can undoubtedly quickly attract the attention of players. From the perspective of the game itself, it can not only effectively improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition, but also guide players to perform expected behaviors. For players, the appearance of the small red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, and the “discomfort” it brings will greatly attract players and induce them to click to eliminate the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reminder and attraction:</strong> Improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition</p>
<ul>
<li>In the game, the use of small red dots is mainly for reminders and attraction. Reminders refer to promptly delivering new messages, gameplays, updates, and other information in the game to players, allowing players to obtain new mail information, notifications, discover new costumes, skills, equipment, attributes, and other content. Attraction is to further guide players to click to increase clicks and exposure on the basis of basic reminder functions.</li>
<li>At the same time, because players’ game time is becoming more and more fragmented, developers must provide players with more convenient ways to use small red dots to allow players to obtain more content within a limited time, reducing invalid exploration and searching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Guidance and expectation:</strong> Guide players to perform expected behavior operations</p>
<ul>
<li>Another important role of the small red dot is to guide players to perform expected behavior operations. In the game, if the guidance is done well, it can allow players to obtain a smooth experience, but if it is not done well, it will make players feel bored and irritable. For example, in the hero interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a “plus sign” shaped red badge is used in the upper right corner of each hero to allow players to click to view new heroes and updated costumes, equipment, etc. of heroes, guiding players to click step by step to view updated content and understand the details of items. After the player clicks to view, the red dot will disappear, which can effectively guide the player to obtain information, and also clear the “red dot” in time, so that the player has a clear and smooth experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?"></a>From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?</h3><p>From the player’s point of view, why do players always can’t help but click on the little red dot?</p>
<p>This is mainly because the appearance of the red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, distinguishing and enhancing the primary and secondary relationship of information. At the same time, it brings players the discomfort of breaking the stability, so it will force players to “deal” with the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Break the balance of information transmission</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The principle of similarity mentions that objects with common elements appear to be more related, usually manifested as visual elements such as shape, color, and size. We also tend to regard similar objects as a group when observing things. When there is no small red dot in the normal state, the information is in equilibrium. The appearance of the small red dot makes it different from other content in the group, breaking the original information balance, efficiently presenting information to players, and allowing players to quickly obtain information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bring “discomfort” to players</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of small red dots in the game can be said to take advantage of the player’s obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology. When there is disharmony, abnormality, and other content in the interface, it will make players feel bored, and they will try to clear and correct these “errors”. The “discomfort” brought to players will greatly attract players, making them actively click to eliminate it, and also complete the game guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?"></a>3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?</h2><p>After understanding the origin and role of the little red dot, we will next explore how to better design and utilize the little red dot in the game interface to provide players with an efficient, smooth, and comfortable experience.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Excessive-Appearance"><a href="#Reduce-Excessive-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Excessive Appearance"></a>Reduce Excessive Appearance</h3><p>The little red dot is not a panacea. When there are many small red dots in the interface, the red dot loses its original meaning. Red dots all over the screen will make players confused. Perhaps some players will click on them one by one under the guidance of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but more players will choose to ignore the existence of red dots, and even feel disgusted. Therefore, the excessive appearance of red dots should be reduced in the interface, the number of displays should be controlled, and key information should be selected for prompting, so that the small red dot can show its due value.</p>
<h3 id="One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate"><a href="#One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate" class="headerlink" title="One-time and Easy to Eliminate"></a>One-time and Easy to Eliminate</h3><p>Many players encounter situations in the game where they cannot eliminate the small red dot, which will cause them to feel extremely irritable. Therefore, in the design, players need to be able to easily eliminate the red dot and make it disappear with a simple operation, restoring a concise and refreshing interface. In some games, this is ignored, and the red dot that is always on will greatly affect the player’s game experience. The red dot elimination principle should meet the following 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-time reminder, disappears after clicking</li>
<li>Click to disappear, reset after re-login</li>
<li>Can be cleared when conditions are met</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path"><a href="#Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path" class="headerlink" title="Ensure a Clear Guidance Path"></a>Ensure a Clear Guidance Path</h3><p>When there are new content updates or reminders for players to collect rewards, it is necessary to use red dots to attract players and guide them to the final page. In the process, if there is a guidance break or a sudden stop, it will cause players to be confused. Therefore, when using small red dots, it is necessary to ensure the clarity of the guidance path. For example, in the reward collection guidance of <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, the appearance of red dots well guides the reward collection path. When the player enters the final page, the red dot disappears, and the collection of the gift package is displayed in the form of special effects. When the player takes the wrong path, the red dot will appear again to correct the player’s path. </p>

<h3 id="Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style"><a href="#Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style" class="headerlink" title="Performance in Line with the Game Style"></a>Performance in Line with the Game Style</h3><p>In the game, the appearance of the small red dot provides players with clear information reminders, but in different scenes, the form of the small red dot should also be different. Of course, no matter what form it appears in, it should have a strong visual effect. In the design, it should also be considered comprehensively from three aspects: color, shape, and form of expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Not just red<ul>
<li>Usually, the appearance of small red dots is mainly red. This is because red will give people a sense of warning, danger, and eye-catching, and it can form a strong contrast with other information, thereby attracting players’ attention. Therefore, designing small red dots in red can well attract players to click.</li>
<li>Of course, in games, due to the different styles and theme colors of different games, the use of “small red dots” can also be flexibly designed. For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the theme color of the game is mainly yellow, so in order to fit the theme color, yellow is also used in the design of the “small red dot”. At the same time, the bright yellow can also attract the attention of players.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Diverse styles<ul>
<li>Also in the choice of shape, especially in games, it is not limited to circles. In the design of the shape, it can be set according to the worldview and style of the game itself, making the interface more holistic. For example, the “small red dot” in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> adopts a pentagonal design, which is selected from the packaging of candies in the original work; the “small red dot” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> adopts the form of a “+” to indicate update reminders; in <em>Onmyoji</em>, although the red dot method is also used, its shape is integrated with the game style, and it is also more unified in the interface.</li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form of expression:</strong> Vivid and image<ul>
<li>In terms of expression, the shape of the small red dot can also be more vivid and image. The combination of pictures and text, the presentation of text, and the performance of micro-motion effects can all enrich the style of the “small red dot”. For example, in <em>UNO!</em>, the small red dot becomes the form of a bubble, and an exclamation mark is displayed in it to indicate information reminders, which can easily attract the attention of players; in the <em>Onmyoji</em> store, the text form is directly used as a badge, which also effectively conveys new information; in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, the friend badge adopts the form of mail and is presented in the form of micro-dynamic shaking, which can also vividly display the reminder information in front of the player, thereby attracting the player to click. The diverse forms of expression make the “small red dot” more emotional and interesting, and it is also easier to bring players a pleasant experience.</li>

<h3 id="Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click"><a href="#Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click" class="headerlink" title="Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click"></a>Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click</h3><p>In the game, in order to allow players to get a good experience, the function design that allows players to eliminate red dot prompts with one click can be described as a boon for obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. In the interactive interface, you can design an interactive button to eliminate red dot prompts in a more conspicuous position, or you can put it in the settings for players to choose the red dot message reminders that need to be eliminated. One-click elimination of red dot prompts is not to close it once and for all, cutting off players’ reminders to get messages, but to provide players with more choices, slow down players’ irritability experience, and red dot prompts will also appear again after re-login to the game (but one-click elimination will also inevitably bring some mistakes).</p>
<p>Of course, when designing the interaction of the one-click elimination button, it can also be more interesting. For example, as early as 2014, QQ added the “drag and disappear” interaction method to eliminate red dots, which is both convenient and interesting, and at the same time can avoid the embarrassment caused by one-click elimination.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, the little red dot has become an effective way of information reminders in the game. Although different forms will be adopted in different functions and usage scenarios, the design of small red dots in games should be more efficient and friendly, effectively reminding players to obtain information. It should not appear casually in order to cope or excessively highlight certain information, which will eventually lead to the proliferation of red dots, causing confusion to players and affecting the player’s game experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, when designing the “little red dot”, you should also consider the necessity of the appearance of the red dot, as well as the consistent form of expression with the game style, and increase the fun of the “little red dot” dynamic effect performance in appropriate circumstances, so that the small red dot can play a big role, truly and efficiently transmit information for players, and reduce players’ boredom with the “red dot”.</p>
