<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230105/28584_1061655.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Player interactions within the game community are an important channel for us to collect player feedback. Unlike face-to-face communication, when we look at the chat content in the community, we lack information beyond language, such as eyes, gestures, and tone of voice, to help us grasp the player’s emotional tendency. If we only focus on the literal meaning of the chat, we might take the player’s sarcasm seriously.</p>
<p>Take the following messages as examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br><em>Game just entirely froze right as the last team came into view. In a gold 1 rated ranked match….nice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br><em>New patch for bots is lovely there absolutely a joke now thanks naraka</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br><em>Player 1: whens gta6 coming out<br>Player 2: 2045<br>Player 1: damn that early?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nice”, “lovely”, “thanks”, “early” seem to reflect the player’s positive emotions, but if you look closely, you can find something wrong: How can it be a good thing to have a problem (froze) in a gold 1 ranked match? If the bots after the new patch are really lovely, how can they be a joke? Is it really early for <em>GTA6</em> to come out in 2045? It seems that no matter what language the players use, they like to use sarcasm.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to correctly interpret players’ emotions from their expressions, in addition to mastering the language used by players, we also need to understand some of their emotional language expression habits.</p>
<h2 id="1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations"></a>1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations</h2><p>Words are composed of letters, so players will manipulate the letters to transform the words. Common methods include using uppercase letters, repeating letters, and replacing words with letters or numbers that sound similar.</p>
<p>Capital letters are generally used at the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, etc., so capital letters are more powerful than lowercase letters, which are usually used. Players will use capital letters to spell words or sentences to express emphasis and strong feelings. For example, we once saw a comment like this: “WHY IS THERE NO SHOWDOWN FOR HALLOWEEN?!?!?”. The player likes Showdown and really hopes to be able to play this mode during Halloween, so the whole message uses capital letters, and the formal deformation is very eye-catching, so as to express their strong desire to play the Showdown mode.</p>
<p>Repeating letters is related to lengthening the pronunciation. For example, one “i” in “ship” is a short vowel, while “ee” in “sheep” is a long vowel. Players can lengthen the word and pronunciation by using repeated letters in the word, such as Morrnnninnggggg (morning), Leeeeeeeeaaaavvvveee (leave), Chilllllll (chill); it can also be used to emphasize the loudness of the sound. SHEEEEESH in the rooster meme below is an example of this usage. Both the image and the text of the rooster meme indicate the loudness of the sound. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F211974b2-df0f-4dd9-800b-6b4b2e45d248.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Meme containing repeated letters</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Repeated letters can also be used to express emphasis, “I have 2 buckets candieeees”. This is a player participating in the in-game Halloween event, where players can get event items by giving candy bags to other players, but this player has two candy bags that cannot be given away, and naturally, they cannot get event items. Players sometimes encounter fellow singers in chat and suddenly start a lyric chain, you say “PROVOKINNNNNGGGGGG”, and I say “BURY THE LIGHT DEEP WITHINNNNN”, using both capitalization and repetition, making people feel the loudness and energy of the song just by looking at the message. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F2287a125-8ef7-4fe8-b98a-616b26366b29.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players engaged in a lyric chain</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players will also use letters and numbers to replace words or parts of words that have the same pronunciation, such as “b4” for “before” and “U” for “you”; sometimes they will also use the pattern of an item with the same pronunciation to represent a word, such as: “U owe me a skin no [image of a hat]”, the hat pattern at the end of the sentence refers to the word “cap”, and “cap” here means “lie”. This sentence means “you owe me a skin, don’t lie”.</p>
<p>Players bet with skins in the game, and the loser has to give the winner a skin. Since “lie” has a slightly serious accusatory meaning, the player uses “cap” instead of “lie” to make the conversation more relaxed and lively. Using the hat pattern instead of directly typing the word further weakens the negative color of “lie”, making the sentence more euphemistic, like a friend reminding jokingly, “Hey, you owe me a skin, don’t lie”. Players also use spaces and line breaks to change the presentation of words and sentences. For example, adding spaces between each letter of a word, L i e s, gives the feeling of spelling out each letter, highlighting the player’s serious attitude and emphasis; another example is using line breaks to split a sentence into paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p><em>One</em></p>
<p><em>Is</em></p>
<p><em>Gonna</em></p>
<p><em>Grab</em></p>
<p><em>Me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each line break is a pause. This form emphasizes the content of each line, which better reflects the player’s pride and confidence in their gaming skills.</p>
<h2 id="2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere"><a href="#2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere"></a>2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere</h2><p>In addition to using memes, European and American players also like to be lazy, using many abbreviations, omissions, or slang in community chats. These methods can not only save typing time and improve chat efficiency, but also help create a relaxed and interesting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a great way to be lazy. We have also encountered abbreviations before, such as ASAP for “as soon as possible”; players will also use the first letter of each word to represent commonly used phrases or sentences, such as “rn” for “right now”, “goat” for “greatest of all time”, “ngl” for “not gonna lie”, “wdym” for “what do you mean”. When we encounter similar abbreviations, we can google the original phrase and accumulate them and create a “player’s common slang library” for future public opinion work.</p>
<p>Omission is also used skillfully by players. Players will omit vowels or consonants in word spelling, and omit punctuation in sentence spelling. In word spelling, vowel letters are omitted, leaving only consonant letters to provide clues to the pronunciation of the word, such as “abt” for “about”, “smh” for “somehow”, “tlk” for “talk”, “nvm” for “never mind”. Although the words are not spelled completely, players who are familiar with this method can restore the complete words through consonant letters.</p>
<p>In addition, players sometimes omit consonant letters, such as “em” for “them”. In order to avoid sensitive words, players will also omit consonant letters, “shi” (omitting the final t). In addition, they will also use symbols with similar shapes to replace letters ($ for S) or use spaces to break up words. As for the omission of punctuation, the first to bear the brunt is ‘, so can’t becomes cant, and I’ll becomes ill.</p>
<p>There is also some slang among players, such as “cap” for “liar”, “simp” for “a person who is overly attentive to someone they like”, “beef” for “brag, show off”. If you can use abbreviations, omissions, and slang skillfully, you must be an active member of community communication and have made great contributions to creating a relaxed and interesting community atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id="3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills"><a href="#3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills"></a>3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills</h2><p>Players will also mix other foreign languages besides English when communicating in the community. The use of foreign languages is either to find partners who use the same language, or to enhance feelings in the process of discussing foreign language learning. Mastering multiple languages is also a manifestation of ability. For example, players will also mix in a few sentences of Spanish or French when chatting, with the purpose of finding friends who speak the same language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: Como vas amigo (How are you, friend)<br>Player 2: Bien. Y tu? (I’m fine, and you)<br>Player 1: Esperando encontrar una partida (I want to find a partner to play games)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the vast sea of English, the sudden appearance of a few sentences in Spanish is like an indicator light, guiding two players who use the same language to get to know each other and become good friends who play games together. But not all friend requests sent in foreign languages will be responded to, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 3: alguien habla español ¿? (Does anyone speak Spanish?)<br>mi nick es “ ……” (My game nickname is…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This player sent a friend request in Spanish and attached his game nickname, but failed to meet a partner who also speaks Spanish in the channel. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Failed to find a Spanish-speaking partner</em></p>
<hr>
<p>European and American players also have foreign language courses in school, the most common being Spanish and French. Occasionally, players will ask other players for help with foreign languages in the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: First language is Spanish but have been learning English since 4th grade<br>Player 2: Teach me espanol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that mastering multiple foreign languages is also a manifestation of ability. Players’ community IDs will also use other languages. Some are Korean players such as “서융”, and some are influenced by Chinese games and use Chinese IDs like “卧虎藏龙” (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Fcb335308-e94a-43d4-9285-d3d08e3cbe37.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players Using Korean and Chinese IDs.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of using Chinese IDs, players have repeatedly mentioned the Chinese game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in game-related discussions, and have the impression that Chinese players are good at <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> because of low latency. Therefore, some players inevitably complain that they are afraid of seeing Chinese names, and that a large number of Chinese players use smurf accounts to play on their servers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: chinese named players strike fear into my soul i stopped playing for a while to see if the player based would become more diverse and now i hear xbox has naraka<br>Player 2: Spoiler alert<br>Half of those CN names<br>Are NA players<br>Like me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But another player told him that half of the players with Chinese names in the game are not Chinese players, like he uses a Chinese name. Later, some players explained that using Chinese names is to scare enemies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9f2e099a-51bb-4469-a01e-f4e5d807dabb.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>North American Players Using Chinese IDs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to Chinese nicknames, a phrase called “raw dragon” frequently appears in player chats. At first glance, it seems inexplicable because it has nothing to do with the context. But if you translate these two words into Chinese separately, “raw” &#x3D; “生”, “dragon” &#x3D; “龙”, and the combination is “生龙”, doesn’t this pronunciation sound familiar? Isn’t this the “升龙” (“Shoryuken”, “Rising Dragon”) in the game? These foreign players really understand the word. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Ff0bed8dd-552a-4f16-841f-fff477f6b632.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World"><a href="#4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World" class="headerlink" title="4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World"></a>4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World</h2><p>Some say that music transcends culture and language, and so do emojis. Emojis use pictures to express emotions, and the meaning of most emojis can be inferred and felt from the picture, without being affected by language.</p>
<p>European and American players like to use emojis in chat. In Discord, emojis are roughly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>● One is Discord’s own basic emojis, which are free for players to use;</p>
<p>● The second is the emojis provided by each server in Discord to players, which can only be used within that server (unless you subscribe to Discord Nitro). The official <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> server provides a set of emojis for players, including emojis based on in-game heroes and emojis newly created based on popular emoji elements (Pepe the Frog, etc.);</p>
<p>● The third is GIFs. Players can search for popular GIFs or save the GIFs they encounter in chats for their own use.</p>
<p>European and American players use these three types of emojis when chatting in the community. Discord’s own emojis and the emojis provided by the current server are the most frequently used by players and are most likely to generate emoji chains, because everyone can use these two types of emojis freely, which is a common language among emojis. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp"><a href="#nbsp" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F32055299-f4d6-423b-a7e4-93b34f6a239e.png/size/"></h2><p><em>Various Emoji usage on Discord.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players use different emojis according to the chat content, and sometimes use emojis to express simple meanings. The meaning of basic emojis (similar to the emojis that come with Apple products) is not affected by language, such as [heart] to express “love”, [eyes emoji] to express “watching”, “secretly observing”.</p>
<p>Complex emojis can express richer meanings, so players need to observe the pictures and feel their emotions. For example: this emoji is slightly different from the usual dog head, and the meaning is also more friendly, with the meaning of “leisure”, which can be used to watch other players chat, and is also easy to cause emoji chains. However, the most frequently used emoji is Rua. This flustered kitten will not go wrong in any occasion. It has mixed meanings of “surprise”, “excitement”, and “greeting”. It is simply a versatile emoji that is not easy to go wrong in any occasion. But if you delve into the meaning of Rua, the answer can only be “Rua is Rua!”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1cb4bb7f-1f3b-46f2-902a-f1774aaec16e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Common Emojis.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Emojis can also be used for dialogue. Taking server emojis as an example, players will take out server-limited emojis that previous players have not posted, which is a tacit understanding of the same server; the same situation applies to personally collected GIFs. If a player who prefers <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs encounters another player who also has a large inventory of <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs, the two will communicate with each other using emojis, while other players who lack this type of emoji may not be able to join the conversation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F5138c3d3-df6c-4a49-977f-52169769243e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Emoji Usage in Discord Servers</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the emojis in Discord, players will also use emoji characters, which are slightly different from the common emoticons we see. The emoji characters used by European and American players are relatively traditional, basically vertical, and need to be rotated ninety degrees to be understood, :), :(, B(, :&lt;, :C, D:, D;, xD, :D, and some emoji characters can be repeated in the mouth part, deriving emoji characters such as :)), B(((, xDD. By repeating a certain part of the emoji character, players can express stronger emotions. Players also use horizontal characters, such as -.-, T_T, o.O, but rarely use more vivid emoticons or patterns built with characters.</p>
<p>The GIFs collected by players may be very different, but the emojis provided by Discord and the server are shared resources of players on the same server. When players use these shared emojis, it is easier to get corresponding emoji feedback. In addition, when using classic emojis (such as Pepe the Frog) in personal collections, it is also easier to elicit responses from other players.</p>
