<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, <em>nijigen</em> (二次元) users have increasingly become the focus of game developers as a potential audience, and on this basis, a variety of genres and gameplay of <em>nijigen</em> games have emerged. However, not all <em>nijigen</em> games can fully meet the needs and expectations of <em>nijigen</em> players. Numerous cases of games stepping on landmines also tell development teams that, as a highly specific player group, <em>nijigen</em> players have some significant minefields in terms of game experience and evaluation. This article will start from the characteristics of <em>nijigen</em> players and analyze the potential experience minefields that <em>nijigen</em> games may encounter.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?"></a>1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?</h2><p>Before answering this question, we must first define what <em>nijigen</em> is. <em>Nijigen</em>, originally meaning “two-dimensional world”, originated in Japan and later became a specialized term in the ACGN subculture circle (including animation, comics, games, novels, etc.), mainly referring to animation, comics, and game works composed of two-dimensional images, as well as the virtual world constructed by their derivatives. In a sense, <em>nijigen</em> is used by the ACGN subculture circle as a term for a fictional world or a fantasy world. It is essentially an existence distinct from the real world (<em>sanjigen</em>, 三次元, meaning “three-dimensional”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1628b45d-7740-4139-a5e3-576f6c85fafa.png/size/"></p>
<p>Considering the broad concept of <em>nijigen</em> itself, the definition of “nijigen games” is also diverse. According to the target players, <em>nijigen</em> games can be divided into two types: “surface <em>nijigen</em>“ and “core <em>nijigen</em>“. Surface <em>nijigen</em> games refer to traditional genre games with a <em>nijigen</em> aesthetic style. The <em>nijigen</em> art style is just a way and means for the game to package traditional gameplay; while core <em>nijigen</em> games are more complex, they explore the deep-seated needs of <em>nijigen</em> culture and users. In terms of game worldview and plot construction, character design, and gameplay ideas, they more reflect the characteristics and preferences of <em>nijigen</em> users as a highly specific subculture group.</p>
<p>In order to understand the reasons why this core <em>nijigen</em> game may attract <em>nijigen</em> players, we used questionnaires and in-depth interviews for research, and summarized the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game factors</strong>, including but not limited to fun game mechanics, good-looking game character design, and attractive plots.</li>
<li><strong>Social factors</strong>, including wanting to integrate into the surrounding circle of friends, socializing with like-minded people, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>tendency of <em>nijigen</em> culture itself to be dreamy and escapist</strong>, including players’ emotional sustenance for game characters, and the game world view can help players escape from real-life pressures and problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players"><a href="#2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?"></a>2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?</h2><p>Considering the many needs of <em>nijigen</em> players for <em>nijigen</em> games, in recent years, domestic game developers have continued to make efforts and launched a variety of <em>nijigen</em> games. However, it should be noted that not every <em>nijigen</em> game is fully in line with the needs and expectations of players after its launch. What’s more, some games have stepped on landmines during the launch and continuous operation, which ultimately led to a decline in players’ in-game activity and out-of-game reputation. Why do these games touch minefields? Where are the potential minefields for <em>nijigen</em> players? By analyzing famous <em>nijigen</em> game failure cases on the market, this article draws the following conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations"><a href="#Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations"></a>Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations</h3><p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding and expectations of the cultural background, worldview, character settings, and their relationship with the characters in the game. Therefore, there may be differences in understanding between game developers and players in terms of the game worldview&#x2F;cultural background, character settings, and the relationship between players and characters, which may lead to deep-seated misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<p>For example, in September 2021, the new SSR Shikigami, <em>Hagishime</em> and <em>Shokurei</em>, announced during the fifth anniversary celebration of <em>Onmyoji</em>, caused a lot of controversy in player gathering and game exchange communities such as Weibo Super Topic and Zhihu. By analyzing the negative public opinion feedback from players, we found that the focus of the controversy was mainly on the art style of the two Shikigami. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9e14f1bd-5a3f-433b-ad1c-a835fa9b39b5.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The art style of the Shikigami is very inconsistent with the game’s art style. Hagishime looks like a traditional Japanese-style Chinese girl, wearing a tight-fitting small cheongsam, which makes me feel sick.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Chinese style elements of the new Shikigami are not well reflected. They are purely Japanese-style Shikigami, but they are mixed with Chinese style elements, which is very abrupt when they stand with other Shikigami. Onmyoji doesn’t look like Onmyoji anymore.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It’s very uncomfortable. The concept is already a Japanese-style game, but now it packages Chinese culture as Japanese characters, speaks Japanese, and can also blow sugar figures, our intangible cultural heritage. It’s hard not to make people think too much.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that the main trigger of this public opinion incident was that the design of the new Shikigami was mixed with Chinese style elements, which was relatively abrupt compared to the original Japanese style of <em>Onmyoji</em>. We know that <em>nijigen</em> culture originated in Japan. Although it has a significant influence in East Asia and even the world, the Japanese-style imprint of <em>nijigen</em> itself is still very distinct. Based on this, <em>nijigen</em> users are very sensitive to the possible Japanese&#x2F;Chinese style mixing in <em>nijigen</em> works, and feel that it is a challenge to the “purity” of the cultural background of the work.</p>
<p>In addition, domestic <em>nijigen</em> players are very sensitive to possible historical hints related to Japan and China in the game. When designing the worldview and characters, it is also necessary to try to avoid domestic players’ negative historical imaginations, including but not limited to wars of aggression, colonial history, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the game’s worldview and cultural background, <em>nijigen</em> players also have a unique understanding of the character design, art style, and their relationship with the characters in the game, which also requires developers to continue to pay attention during the game development and continuous operation. We still take <em>Onmyoji</em> as an example. In 2019, the official designed a new skin for the Shikigami <em>Onikiri</em>, as shown below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F276b255c-26d6-40db-a615-a32a174fc321.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>As soon as the new skin was launched, it was questioned by many players. Players believed that the bangs, the sharp blade designed in the style of a kitchen knife, and the <em>kariginu</em> (狩衣) that resembled an apron made <em>Onikiri</em>, known as the “most powerful demon-slaying weapon of the Minamoto family”, appear “maid-like”, which was very different from its long-standing image of a “sharp blade” in the hearts of players. This case also tells us that in terms of character portraits and skin design, <em>nijigen</em> games should be in line with <em>nijigen</em> players’ imagination of character rarity, personality, and combat strength. Even when setting the skin and skill strength of popular characters, it is necessary to carefully consider player expectations.</p>
<p>The characters and settings in <em>nijigen</em> games are not completely independent of the players’ imagination. On the contrary, <em>nijigen</em> players are considered to be consumers with the characteristics of productive consumers (prosumers). They are often not limited to unilaterally consuming the acquired <em>nijigen</em> content, but also provide new content possibilities through their own understanding and reprocessing. This also requires <em>nijigen</em> games to provide interfaces for players’ active deconstruction and reshaping in terms of worldview, character, and plot design. Generally speaking, this interface is through the direct relationship between the player and the <em>nijigen</em> character, which is generally divided into four relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyber Lover Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with romantic elements. Players believe that they have an ambiguous relationship with the characters. “Playing the game is like falling in love with a paper person”.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivation Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with strong cultivation elements. Players believe that they are raising the characters, and the characters are their own “children”.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive Relationship:</strong> Players believe that they can immerse themselves in the characters and integrate into the game world through the observation and behavior of the characters.</li>
<li><strong>Spectator Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games where the characters have their own storylines. Players are more of spectators and plot promoters, watching the love and hate between the characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding of their relationship with the characters in the game. The same character in the same game can even have completely different plot and character network development when interpreted by different players. At this time, <em>nijigen</em> games need to try to avoid large errors between their own design of the plot and character relationships and the players’ own imagination. For example, if a player regards a character in the game as a “waifu”, but a real official NPC partner appears in the process of advancing the plot, this will cause discomfort to the player’s experience.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen"><a href="#Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen"></a>Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen</h3><p>The previous minefields are limited to <em>nijigen</em> games and users themselves, but under this minefield, <em>nijigen</em> games need to face the broader impact of <em>sanjigen</em> reality. In the eyes of <em>nijigen</em> players, one of the important demands of experiencing <em>nijigen</em> games is to escape reality. Although <em>nijigen</em> and <em>sanjigen</em> have mutual influence, it is necessary to make a clear distinction when necessary. For example, players are very taboo about <em>nijigen</em> characters having significant <em>sanjigen</em> prototypes or private settings, which they believe affect their own immersion and imagination. In addition, in the selection of spokespersons for <em>nijigen</em> games, <em>nijigen</em> players have their own screening strategies: in addition to being in line with the character settings, they will also consider a certain ranking of spokespersons. Celebrities and idols from <em>sanjigen</em> may even be criticized by <em>nijigen</em> players for their traffic and influence.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that <em>nijigen</em> games and <em>sanjigen</em> are completely unrelated. If there is a problem with the behind-the-scenes staff of <em>sanjigen</em> (including but not limited to legal, political, and moral issues), which affects the player’s experience of <em>nijigen</em> characters, most <em>nijigen</em> players cannot tolerate it, and the official needs to respond quickly.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary-How-to-Analyze-the-Game-Needs-of-Specific-Groups-of-Players"><a href="#3-Summary-How-to-Analyze-the-Game-Needs-of-Specific-Groups-of-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?"></a>3. Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?</h2><p>The analysis of the possible experience minefields of <em>nijigen</em> players in <em>nijigen</em> games shows the importance of analyzing the characteristics, preferences, and minefields of specific player groups for the successful development and continuous operation of games. What kind of ideas and methods can be summarized from this?</p>
<p>In terms of research ideas, it is first necessary to analyze the portrait and needs of specific player groups. The development team needs to understand the characteristics of the player group and analyze the possible needs of players for the game from the characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, questionnaires can cover a larger group of players in a short period of time, which can help the development team to draw relatively “universal” group characteristics. However, if you encounter situations where you need to dig deeper into details, you can use more qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups for research.</p>
