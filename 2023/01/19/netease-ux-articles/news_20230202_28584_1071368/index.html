<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The fourth wall is a virtual wall facing the audience in a traditional proscenium stage with three sides, symbolizing the boundary between the audience and the actors, reality and virtuality.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional stages such as movies and dramas, narrative-driven games are stages with more interaction; when the boundary between the game and reality becomes blurred, the player’s cognition of the game will be challenged. Imagine that you are controlling the protagonist to do “silly things” in the map for fun, but he suddenly turns his head and stares at you, and asks you to stop… This kind of design that breaks the fourth wall belongs to meta.</p>
<p>Meta-games, also translated as “metagames” or “hypergames,” and out-of-game elements beyond the gameplay itself can be called meta elements. Narrowly speaking, a meta-game refers to a full-process game that takes breaking the fourth wall as its core gameplay; in general narrative-driven games, meta elements of different depths can also be added to produce a momentary stunning effect.</p>
<p>In traditional game design theory, emphasis is placed on creating a virtual world isolated from real life as much as possible through various rules and restrictions, as well as graphics, music, dialogue, etc., to maintain the player’s immersion. Game design based on meta elements does the opposite, blurring the boundaries between games and real life by breaking the illusion of the game, thus bringing strong emotional experiences to players: ordinary games pull you into the screen, while meta-games always try to crawl out of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements"></a>1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements</h2><p>Meta means breaking the concept of traditional games at some level, such as the player being the only conscious operator in the game, the game content and out-of-game computer operations not interfering with each other, the virtual world of the game not containing concepts such as players, artists, and developers. Meta elements can generally be divided into language, trick, and interactive experience; the shallower depth can only be used as a decoration to adjust the atmosphere, and the deeper excavation can become the core of the game’s plot or even the core of gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature"><a href="#Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature"></a>Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature</h3><p>As embellishments, meta elements often appear in the form of surprises or easter eggs, and do not have a strong challenge to the player’s cognition. In fact, the appearance of game producers who were originally hidden behind the scenes in the game and interacting with players is a very common meta design; they often make statements that are extremely inconsistent with the style of the game or give special items, allowing players to temporarily break away from the serious game plot and take a breather; some more detailed meta designs can also surprise players, such as waiting for a period of time on the start interface, and the small animal facing away from the screen suddenly turns to look at the outside of the screen, etc. </p>

<h3 id="Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot"><a href="#Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design About Character Plot"></a>Meta Design About Character Plot</h3><p>One type of meta that explores deeper and is widely used is to imply or explicitly state that the characters in the game have self-awareness that is not controlled by the player; the characters know that they are game characters, and can understand the existence of the player, and even read the player’s user folder name to address the player.</p>
<p>The experience of being recognized is a double-edged sword. When the character’s attitude towards recognizing the player is peaceful and friendly, and there is no very intense interaction, the player will feel that this is a novel and interesting experience, such as Anna in <em>VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em> who knows that she is in a game and tries to escape. However, when the game character shows criticism, sarcasm, or hurt towards the player, this experience of being watched will bring a great psychological gap to the player and re-examine their game behavior. </p>

<h3 id="Meta-Design-that-Challenges-the-Concept-of-Games"><a href="#Meta-Design-that-Challenges-the-Concept-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design that Challenges the Concept of Games"></a>Meta Design that Challenges the Concept of Games</h3><p>Common sense about games includes: the passage of time in the game world is independent of the passage of time in the outside world, and the game can be exited and restarted at any time; the game is an independent software, the game process is independent of the player’s operation of the system, and will not affect the external system. One type of meta element breaks through this common sense of the game and replaces it with the common sense of the real world.</p>
<p>In the RPG horror puzzle game <em>The Witch’s House</em>, the player can enter a hidden ending where the character in the castle dies on their own due to being left unattended for a long time by waiting at the birth point for an hour without entering the castle; in the game <em>Needy Streamer Overload</em>, to achieve the hidden ending where the heroine quits the internet, the player needs to play the game offline. </p>

<h3 id="Atypical-Meta-Design"><a href="#Atypical-Meta-Design" class="headerlink" title="Atypical Meta Design"></a>Atypical Meta Design</h3><p>There is also a type of meta that is not meta in the usual sense, which creates a better sense of immersion by breaking the boundary that one thought oneself was in a single-player game. For example, in the boss battle of a certain ending of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, players can get assistance from other players who have cleared the game; after winning the battle, players can choose to sacrifice their entire game save in exchange for help for subsequent players, just like previous players. </p>

Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?"></a>2. Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?</h2><p>In traditional narrative-driven games, when players control the characters on the screen, they identify themselves with the identity of the protagonist on the screen on the one hand, and clearly know their identity as players on the other hand. Being a player means that one is the only conscious character in the game, and the behavior in the game will not affect real life, and there is no need to bear any responsibility and material loss for the behavior - these unspoken common principles in the game ensure that players can safely immerse themselves in the game experience.</p>
<p>The excellent meta with greater depth can bring players unexpected, surprising, fearful, fooled, and even ashamed emotional experiences, often stemming from its challenge to the traditional relationship of “real-world player - virtual-world game”.</p>
<h3 id="Becoming-the-Watched-God"><a href="#Becoming-the-Watched-God" class="headerlink" title="Becoming the Watched God"></a>Becoming the Watched God</h3><p>Meta-games often challenge this common sense: the content and characters in the game are the objects of the player’s cognition, and will not in turn recognize the player. In traditional narrative-driven games, players are often the only conscious operators in the game, and interacting with the game is essentially a kind of self-entertainment.</p>
<p>However, when the object in the game behaves like an independent conscious individual and can recognize the player, the player will enter a social situation from a state of solitude, falling from an omnipotent god to a height where he needs to make eye contact with the character; his behavior suddenly has an audience watching, becoming an experience of being caught off guard.</p>
<p>Being watched means being exposed. When people don’t want to expose themselves and feel that they are about to be exposed, they are prone to fear and anxiety. This is also why meta elements most often appear in games containing psychological horror elements. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Ff708c528-80f3-4809-9932-92b3038f0e80.jpg/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Loss-of-the-Mask"><a href="#Loss-of-the-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Loss of the Mask"></a>Loss of the Mask</h3><p>The fact that the player is not recognized means that his identity in the game is actually indistinguishable from other players, that is, he has anonymity. In a completely anonymous psychological state, the psychological pressure on individuals from group norms or the influence of others will be reduced, which has the effect of relaxing the mood and reducing stress, but it is also accompanied by the loss of social responsibility and the danger of inducing various horrors and venting behaviors.</p>
<p>The game provides players with a sense of anonymity, that is, it provides players with the opportunity to play comfortably and freely in the virtual world, and even try various behaviors that cannot be tried in the social environment without regard to the consequences.</p>
<p>But when the character or the game itself is linked to the player’s real life in some way and monitors the player’s actions, arousing the player’s self-awareness, the player’s anonymity is suddenly violated, and he becomes an active participant in the plot from a casual player who does not need to be responsible, and needs to be responsible for everything that happens to the character. </p>

<h3 id="Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone"><a href="#Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone" class="headerlink" title="Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone"></a>Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone</h3><p>A sense of control refers to a psychological state in which the direction of things is under one’s control; it can enhance an individual’s positive emotional experience such as optimism and self-confidence, and weaken negative emotional experiences such as depression and helplessness. In real life, people have to face all kinds of loss of control caused by force majeure; therefore, the important charm of traditional narrative-driven games is to try to interact with the corresponding worldview system, and the player’s power to decide the fate of virtual characters.</p>
<p>Meta elements do the opposite, subtly depriving players of their sense of control in the virtual world. When players unexpectedly find that they cannot fully control their choices, cannot anticipate the relationship between their behavior and reactions, or the reactions caused are completely beyond expectations, a sense of loss of control arises. Just like a roller coaster, the temporary eruption of negative emotions is also a benign stimulus under the condition of no real danger; the anxiety caused by loss of control on the one hand pulls the player back to reality to think, and on the other hand can become an excitement point for some players. </p>

<h2 id="3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements"></a>3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements</h2><p>The most mainstream meta design forms in current narrative-driven games include interface crashes, intervention in reality, narrator intervention, and multiple playthroughs. Interface crashes guide players to pay attention to the attributes of the game itself as software, such as the start button of <em>Pony Island</em> is designed as <code>&lt;error&gt;</code> at the beginning, and players must repair it; intervention in reality takes it a step further on the level of “the program itself has life”, such as <em>IMSCARED</em> will create a new strange folder on the player’s computer desktop and put the puzzle clues in it, and players will also operate pixel computers in the game; narrator intervention is to use an independent narrator to interfere with the player’s choices, and the domestic horizontal fighting game <em>ICEY</em> is a typical example in recent years; multiple playthroughs are widely used in many pixel RPGs and Galgames, and are often related to save-related operations. The famous meta game <em>OneShot</em> has made very clever use of this technique.&lt;&#x2F;error. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4b2fd2c8-65a8-40a9-b824-2f4a8b786255.jpg/size/" alt="有必要的时候，玩家需要删改游戏存档"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>When necessary, players need to delete and modify game saves</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In essence, many meta elements are designed for the player’s own meta-gaming behavior. The environment gives players some prior knowledge, such as when a warrior in a game environment sees a monster named Medusa for the first time, the player knows to instruct the warrior to take out a mirror to reflect the gaze. In ordinary games, players will unconsciously use many meta-gaming strategies, that is, resort to out-of-game elements in their minds to make decisions in the game, such as directly entering the password in the second playthrough of a puzzle game based on memory. Ordinary games have no feedback on this strategy, and recognizing the player’s own meta-gaming behavior and setting feedback for the behavior is a way to break the fourth wall.</p>
<p>For example, in the well-known beautiful girl (horror) game <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em>, players are often deceived by the energetic color scheme and cute character images, and substitute traditional cognitions about other games of this type in their minds: not all characters can be captured, and they may also die tragically, and game saves may disappear at any time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F188edebc-2b64-4822-8ca8-2dd7119f617a.png/size/" alt="你可以读档，但是她已经被删除了"></p>

<h2 id="4-What-Can-Meta-Bring-Us"><a href="#4-What-Can-Meta-Bring-Us" class="headerlink" title="4. What Can Meta Bring Us?"></a>4. What Can Meta Bring Us?</h2><p>The existence of meta techniques actually expands the upper limit of the ideas that plot-driven games can express as a game medium. When the boundary between virtual and real becomes blurred, the content conveyed in the game is related to real life, and what is finally left to the player is inexplicable melancholy and subtle reflection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fbf1ee034-cc48-42e5-b98f-bd6013c1898e.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, players can only get a variety of endings if they refuse to always follow the narrator’s instructions.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps not all meta designs are good designs; many times, they also appear only as a pastime in the tense game process. However, the potential of meta elements to convey philosophical thoughts is also undeniable. Although serious meta blurs the boundary between virtual and real, its necessary step is to awaken players from the omniscient and omnipotent dream in the game. In this sense, breaking the fourth wall is actually not breaking the wall, but discovering this wall spiritually; in the face of a living game, we have to start examining our own game behavior, our relationship with the game, and perhaps our own lives.</p>
