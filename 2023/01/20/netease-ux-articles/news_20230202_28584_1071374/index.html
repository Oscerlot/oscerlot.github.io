<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game maps are simulations of real environments, with cognitive, simulation, loading, and transmission functions. Their design is to guide players to choose certain paths and trigger certain events in the game. The mini-map in the game displays a part of the area centered on the character, which can help players quickly identify the surrounding environment, terrain, and target information. It is often placed in the corner of the game screen and is a map form that helps players determine their position in the game world.</p>
<p>So, as a game designer, how should you make good use of this information display area to convey key information to players and present a “seeing the big picture” design effect? This article will introduce three aspects: concise and clear information expression, association with character status, and association with player needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression"><a href="#1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression" class="headerlink" title="1. Concise and Clear Information Expression"></a>1. Concise and Clear Information Expression</h2><p>The mini-map function is indispensable for some games and players, but at the same time, its existence will reduce the player’s immersion in the game and distract the player’s attention to the game screen. The simplified information expression design of the mini-map is not only to pursue higher information retrieval efficiency, but also to reduce its visual interference through design, thereby enhancing the sense of substitution for the character to explore the world.</p>
<h3 id="Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display"><a href="#Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display" class="headerlink" title="Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display"></a>Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display</h3><p>Appropriate contrast can make the foreground map elements and icon labels easier to distinguish visually from their backgrounds. Different from the simple background color in general interface design, the map uses the default base map, and the content display is more complicated, which makes the mini-map need to be more refined in the use of color. In the game mini-map design, the following points can be summarized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-saturation map base map, markers use high-saturation theme colors to be consistent with the game’s visual style</li>
<li>Clear color levels, colors of different hues should be both contrasting and coordinated</li>
<li>Effective use of the symbolism of colors (such as the warning of red and yellow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Use-Icon-Details-to-Represent-the-Z-axis"><a href="#Use-Icon-Details-to-Represent-the-Z-axis" class="headerlink" title="Use Icon Details to Represent the Z-axis"></a>Use Icon Details to Represent the Z-axis</h3><p>As a two-dimensional plane, the mini-map can be used to confirm the player’s own xy-axis position, but additional instructions are needed on the z-axis, so making the target icon have multiple states is a common indication method. Some games use whether there is a height difference as the state distinction. For example, in <em>Battlefield 1</em>, when the character has a height difference with the target object, the marker will change from solid to hollow, which is used to roughly estimate the enemy’s position. The z-axis representation of some games includes three states: up, down, and horizontal. Use the direction of the arrow to confirm your z-axis position. For example, in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, use small arrows next to the target to show above or below. </p>

<h3 id="Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information"><a href="#Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information" class="headerlink" title="Integrated Display with Other Information"></a>Integrated Display with Other Information</h3><p>The game’s HUD is an integrated display of a “symbol list”, which needs to summarize and link similar information to form a clearer HUD layout. As a component of the HUD that occupies a large proportion, the mini-map will attract more attention from players. Displaying some information close to the mini-map allows players to always observe other information every time they check the mini-map to confirm location information, and at the same time allows the player’s visual route to be more stable and concentrated. Common examples include system information such as weather, temperature, and time. Some games also integrate character status information such as health and energy into the mini-map, but it is also necessary to pay attention to how to display this information when the mini-map UI is closed.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, special location sensing, temperature, sound, time and weather information are displayed with the mini-map in the lower right corner of the interface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F47dcfb1d-f335-41d0-b88d-2b43cb6f6496.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, health and energy and other information are combined with the mini-map in the form of small icons, and integrated information is displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fe97d898d-2e26-4866-b0ec-0cb50be6f112.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em>, health and focus are integrated with the mini-map in the form of edge strips. Integrated information display makes the entire HUD design clearer and simpler. But if the mini-map is closed, all important indicators on the UI will disappear with it, which is a point to pay attention to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd690d1b6-2663-4556-bf4d-5f35e526b774.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Edge-Blurring-Effect"><a href="#Edge-Blurring-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Edge Blurring Effect"></a>Edge Blurring Effect</h3><p>Compared with the frame design with harder outlines, the edge blurring effect can make the mini-map better integrate with the game environment and reduce visual interference. At this time, the base map is mostly a wireframe effect after grayscale processing, and the logo object is more prominent. <em>Dying Light</em> and <em>Diablo III</em> both adopt this method. Compared with <em>Darksiders II</em> with a stroked border, the visual center of the picture is significantly different. </p>

<h3 id="Compass-style-Guidance-Only-Providing-Key-Direction-Information"><a href="#Compass-style-Guidance-Only-Providing-Key-Direction-Information" class="headerlink" title="Compass-style Guidance, Only Providing Key Direction Information"></a>Compass-style Guidance, Only Providing Key Direction Information</h3><p>Considering the player’s attention and immersion, many games have adopted a compromise approach to the mini-map, that is, only retaining the most important direction information - compass-style guidance. The form of the compass will not excessively destroy the sense of immersion. Their position is usually placed in the center of the top, and the design is not too conspicuous. Although it indicates the direction of the destination, it still cannot show the exact path that the player needs to take, which requires the player to still rely on their own exploration to reach the destination. Compass-style guidance makes pathfinding a part of the game loop and retains its core function. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd423018b-0224-4369-98d9-436d12248eb9.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-Associated-with-Character-Status"><a href="#2-Associated-with-Character-Status" class="headerlink" title="2. Associated with Character Status"></a>2. Associated with Character Status</h2><p>Since the character’s status in the game is constantly changing, for example, when moving and sprinting, the player’s needs for vision will be different. When the character is attacked, the mini-map, as a HUD element, can also give feedback prompts to the player through design. Therefore, the display of the mini-map also needs to be associated with the character’s status, taking into account different usage scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting"><a href="#Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting" class="headerlink" title="Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting"></a>Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting</h3><p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, when the character is in a sprinting state, usually in the situation of looting spoils, chasing enemies, and accelerating escape, the player’s need is to obtain a farther field of view. Therefore, the mini-map in the lower left corner will shrink and present a farther range of content. When sprinting ends, the display range returns to the original normal size. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, when the character moves, the task mini-map will automatically become translucent, which is convenient for players to observe the game scene while finding their way, without excessively blocking the player’s sight. </p>

Feedback performance is usually in the form of mini-map border color and mini-map special effects. Among them, the change of border color is more obvious, and high-saturation colors are mostly used to distinguish. The mini-map special effects are mostly to simulate the real state of being attacked, such as screen failure flickering, heartbeat scaling, etc., so that the mini-map is no longer a single UI independent of the game.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the mini-map has a black border in the normal state. When a battle is about to occur or a large monster appears around, a larger black border will appear around the mini-map and keep zooming like a heart rate, simulating the effect of accelerated heartbeat; after entering the combat state, the map border turns red; if the character is hiding in the grass or wearing an invisible suit at this time, the border will turn purple to indicate that the monster has not found the character in the field of vision, but is still on alert; after leaving the battle, a thick white border appears around the mini-map and then returns to the normal state, indicating that the danger is over; when riding a monster, a large white border appears around the mini-map to show the monster’s stamina value. The lower the stamina value, the smaller the diameter of the white border, until the stamina value is exhausted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F82302794-65e6-4033-8139-d0d0ffffafe3.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Need for Speed Heat</em>, when the player has a car crash, the mini-map will shake like a data stream to simulate the situation of the dashboard failure after a car crash in real life, giving the player feedback prompts while creating a real immersive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4e218385-ad05-4a7b-8f40-3e42ab9f86d1.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Associated-with-Player-Needs"><a href="#3-Associated-with-Player-Needs" class="headerlink" title="3. Associated with Player Needs"></a>3. Associated with Player Needs</h2><p>For different types of games and players’ different growth states, even different difficult terrains, the functional requirements of the mini-map vary from person to person, from time to time, and from shape to shape. Design needs to consider the player’s needs at all times, giving the mini-map more custom options and adaptation schemes to ensure a smooth and immersive game experience for players.</p>
<h3 id="Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner"><a href="#Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner" class="headerlink" title="Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner"></a>Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner</h3><p>Due to the high information density of the mini-map and the prominent visual effects of some game mini-maps, it will cause the player’s visual center to shift and lack immersion. Many games allow players to close the mini-map UI to optimize the immersive experience. By guiding in the game scene, such as NPC pathfinding&#x2F;road signs&#x2F;scene interaction&#x2F;area prompts when changing locations + player memory and other forms to achieve the purpose of pathfinding. At the same time, for example, in scenes where fighting is the core operation, direction information becomes unnecessary information, and simplifying the UI to provide players with a more focused interface design is also particularly important.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the mini-map can be switched freely. When the mini-map is closed, pressing the D-pad will briefly display the mini-map to help players quickly identify the direction.</li>
<li>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, when the player is fighting fiercely with the boss, because the player’s core need at this time is to fight and focus on the battle, the compass-style mini-map guidance will disappear at this time, and the absence of redundant UI also increases the epic sense of the battle.</li>
<li>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, players are provided with normal mode and expert mode. The expert mode hides the mini-map, allowing players familiar with the operation to focus more on immersing themselves in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain"><a href="#Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain" class="headerlink" title="Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain"></a>Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain</h3><p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, due to the variability and complexity of the interior of the Divine Beast, at this time, players need not only the information of the xy axis, but also the information of the z axis. Therefore, after entering the Divine Beast, the mini-map will switch from a 2D俯视 (fǔ shì - top-down) view to a 3D three-dimensional view to help players obtain information for exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fce639c44-baa0-4063-81cc-1d6aa95454a5.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The increasingly rich mini-map design forms are indeed eye-catching. Creative and rich detail expression simplifies the game’s pathfinding experience and improves the efficiency of map information retrieval. However, the setting of the mini-map will make many players dependent. Compared with focusing on exploring the in-game scene, the “God’s perspective” mini-map makes information acquisition easier, which will make players lazy and mechanical in exploring the world. Therefore, the mini-map not only needs a concise and immersive UI design, situational interaction design, and multi-state mode design, but also needs to give players appropriate space to process information independently. Providing personalized guidance experience for different players and scenes may also be a good solution.</p>
