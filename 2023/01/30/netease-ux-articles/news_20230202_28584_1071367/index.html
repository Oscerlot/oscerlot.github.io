<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China"></a>1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China</h2><p>Sid Meier, the father of the <em>Civilization</em> series, once expressed his understanding of games with this sentence: “A game is a series of interesting choices.”</p>
<p>Game developers choose and design game mechanics, while players experience choices within the game mechanics, and ultimately, players choose the game. The broad concept of SLG games can be traced back to <em>Civilization</em> in the 1990s. With the development of the Internet era, players gradually began to desire social elements on the basis of single-player gameplay, and SLG mobile games emerged. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F075804e9-2a84-4efc-8575-6c80364b879e.png/size/"></p>
<p>In 2015, with the huge success of <em>Clash of Kings</em> (COK) in the Chinese mobile game market and worldwide, the relatively niche sub-genre of SLG mobile games entered the vision of the general public and game manufacturers. In the same year, just as large and small game manufacturers in China were preparing their own COK-like mobile games, NetEase released a sandbox strategy mobile game called <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> (<em>率土之滨</em>). This mobile game, based on the historical background of the warlord separatism in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, did not become a follower of COK. Instead, it created a unique gameplay mechanism in the SLG category and developed into the pioneering work of the “Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like” category of games that would contend with COK-like games in the future of domestic SLG mobile games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F95ec6618-7a2e-4394-a29f-7878d2d1f135.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the development and iteration of SLG games in recent years, various COK-like and Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like mobile games have sprung up. The limitation of these games is that they only made micro-innovations in the worldview and some mechanisms, but essentially did not deviate from the underlying framework of COK or Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Currently, most mainstream domestic SLGs are simulation strategy war games, whose main feature is a sandbox map as the core activity space, with high social strategy. Unlike SLG series such as <em>Civilization</em> and <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, the core experience and fun of current SLG mobile games have gradually shifted from the content provided by the game itself, that is, the interaction between players and the game, to the behavior and interaction between players.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the main body of player-game interaction and the carrier of interaction between players, the importance of information interaction on the sandbox map of SLG mobile games is self-evident. This article will conduct a preliminary exploration and analysis of battlefield information interaction in SLG games.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Underlying-Logic-of-Sand-Table-Types"><a href="#2-The-Underlying-Logic-of-Sand-Table-Types" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underlying Logic of Sand Table Types"></a>2. The Underlying Logic of Sand Table Types</h2><p>According to the interaction logic of the sand table, the sand tables of SLG mobile games can be divided into two types: coordinate type and path type. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F09dad672-b988-4117-8138-a1350f0b8b26.png/size/"></p>
<p>The coordinate-type sand table is based on a two-dimensional coordinate system. The map elements on the coordinate-type sand table map are all independent “points”. You only need to input coordinate instructions to go to the target position. The sand table maps of <em>Clash of Kings</em> and <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> belong to the coordinate type. The path-type sand table is similar to a network topology. It adds path requirements on the basis of the coordinate-type sand table. Players need to have “connecting land” to reach the target location. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F54619b7b-8a65-4959-af56-963116ac556c.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Different sand table types bring vastly different depths of gameplay strategy and division of labor. For example, the unique mechanisms of “road paving” and “battle-free period” in Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games come from this. Although the path-type sand table type can provide deeper and broader playability, it also increases the game burden on players to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Although some Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games have introduced functions such as AI automatic road paving or scheduled occupation, overly intelligent proxy operations also compress the player’s operating space, resulting in a decline in the game’s DAU. The future trend of SLG mobile games may be to achieve a balance between auxiliary tools and game experience, so that players with different levels of dedication can “get what they want” and maximize the game experience in their respective positions.</p>
<h2 id="3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements"><a href="#3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Interaction Design of Map Elements"></a>3. Interaction Design of Map Elements</h2><p>Thanks to the real historical background and reliable element architecture, in the grand sand table map of over 2.25 million tiles, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only has historical cities of the late Eastern Han Dynasty, famous historical sites admired by the world, and natural terrain processed for balance based on strict adherence to real mountains and rivers, and resource lands for player development, but also includes building elements with military or development functions. These rich map elements jointly participate in the construction of the game mechanism of this work, giving it a strong historical atmosphere and a strong sense of immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F26f226c8-9386-4698-aa5d-84a99bd14aaa.png/size/"></p>
<p>In order to enable players to efficiently and stably obtain the information meaning of many map elements and minimize the occurrence of misoperations, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> mainly designs from the following two levels:</p>
<p>In terms of visual interaction, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> designs visual elements consistent with its semantics for each map element, which greatly reduces the cognitive burden of players. For resource lands with two to nine levels, it first uses four typical characteristic elements of mountains, forests, iron smelting, and rice to distinguish them, and then differentiates them according to the number of elements (two to four levels) and buildings (five to nine levels). In addition, in order to meet the visual preferences of different players as much as possible, the game also provides 2D&#x2F;3D visual schemes for players to freely switch.</p>
<p>In terms of map interaction, when the player clicks on any land unit on the map, the detailed information of the unit and corresponding operation prompts will be displayed. For operations that cannot be performed, grayscale images are displayed instead of being directly hidden. Moreover, when the player clicks on the interaction option, the reason why the operation cannot be performed will be informed in text, so that the player can understand. Through detailed interaction feedback, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only greatly reduces the learning threshold and cognitive burden of new players, but also effectively avoids many misoperation events caused by inadequate information interaction, which greatly improves the player’s interaction experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F14e64f92-2868-4a94-a2f6-098b55687f38.png/size/"></p>
<p>Similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>, the resource lands of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> also use characteristic elements and buildings to graphically distinguish resource lands, and further directly and clearly mark the level of resource lands in the form of text. This visual interaction design achieves a win-win situation in terms of experience and efficiency. However, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> is limited by the overall map style and is not suitable for direct map marking, so it can only be supplemented by interaction feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, the map resource search control of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> can quickly locate the target type and level of resource land, freeing players from the tedious map information retrieval, which greatly improves the player’s interaction efficiency and game experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F9e238179-e48f-4464-a2e0-f4fbd309c8e2.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers"><a href="#4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers" class="headerlink" title="4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers"></a>4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers</h2><p>“Marching” in <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> refers to the command operation of sending a team from a certain starting point to a certain end point. When the player issues this operation, a marking line composed of directional arrows will be formed between the starting point grid and the end point grid, so that the player can obtain marching information. At the same time, there will be an army element walking along the marching marker line. This element consists of a marching icon, a marching countdown, and the troop composition: the enemy and friend can be identified by the icon and the color of the marching marker (blue for allies, red for others), the marching countdown shows the time remaining until the end of the march; the troop composition represents the arms that make up this troop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F37ad7f0f-7a00-4c6d-9ceb-da9777c80fdd.png/size/"></p>
<p>In actual combat, the information value provided by marching markers is far more than what is shown on the surface: by identifying enemies and friends, you can judge the approximate scale of the enemy and our forces invested in the current land&#x2F;war zone; by analyzing the troop composition of the army element, you can analyze the arms attributes and characteristics of the three generals that make up this troop, and guess the configuration of the incoming troop based on the mainstream troops of the version; according to the marching countdown and the preview of the marching time, you can grasp the timing of the troop’s attack. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F114839bf-f81f-4482-be77-e4500f516ff2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The marching marker elements of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> are similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players on the same sandbox map can obtain information such as enemy and friend information, marching countdown, and troop composition through marching markers. But unlike traditional SLG mobile games, the RTS control mode of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> adds more possibilities to marching. Although RTS has higher requirements for the player’s online time, and micro-operations are difficult to truly realize on the mobile game platform, this flexible mode with a stronger operating experience has attracted a large number of players and received good market feedback.</p>
<h2 id="5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map"><a href="#5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map" class="headerlink" title="5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map"></a>5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map</h2><p>As the core element of the SLG mobile game mechanism, the alliance (nation) mechanism is not only a centralized social window in the game, but also the main platform for players to obtain settlement rewards in the season process. The confrontation between players takes the form of wars between alliances. In the vast sandbox map, it is crucial to distinguish enemy and friend information intuitively and efficiently. <em>Clash of Kings</em> uses different land grid colors to distinguish the ownership of different alliances, while <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> has innovated the land ownership information in multiple dimensions: the player’s own land units are marked in green, alliance units are marked in blue, non-alliance units are marked in red, hostile alliance units are marked in dark red, and friendly alliance units are marked with a blue border… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F30605791-57b5-4dfd-96eb-9e3dfed99faf.png/size/"></p>
<p>“Six Secret Teachings” says: “Ascend to high places and look down to observe the changes of the enemy.” If you can see the overall situation, you can plan to defeat the enemy; if you are blinded by a leaf, you will inevitably be trapped. On the battlefield, if you can quickly grasp the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, you can make more accurate strategic judgments. The core of the SLG requirement path is a strategic model based on multi-person participation in phased requirements (exploration, expansion, development, elimination, etc.). With the continuous development and improvement of the SLG mobile game alliance mechanism, and the refinement of the division of labor of players’ roles and positions in the alliance, the early lower-level map information mode based on land unit information can no longer meet the information needs of local tactical strategies and even global strategic posture formulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fa511d00f-8ab0-46ef-8866-1efc8af9a4c4.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Limited by the screen size of mobile games, players can often only obtain more information by constantly sliding the screen. This method is not only inefficient but also easily confuses information, which seriously affects the game experience of some users. Although the “larger field of view” configuration option provided by early developers in the game settings already has the prototype and awareness of a strategic map, this does not fundamentally solve the problem. In the strategic map level, most of the map elements have become generalized summary information. At this time, land unit information is no longer important. These information unrelated to decision-making will be filtered out, leaving more global map information for decision-makers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4fc1e88d-75df-410d-8977-694eaa3fb3c5.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the August 2022 update, the strategic map function was officially launched in all season servers of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players can enter the strategic mode by zooming out the screen view. In the strategic mode, the visual range is 20 times that of the normal view, providing players with a more macroscopic observation perspective, so as to easily grasp the overall situation and provide strong support for the strategic decision-making of alliance commanders.</p>
<p>Different from the detailed land information in the normal view, the strategic view abstracts and simplifies various information elements, focusing on key strategic information such as land ownership, marching routes, garrison status in war zones, native cities and facilities, and extreme weather effects. Although the strategic map of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> was launched later than similar competitive products, this strategic map that deeply fits the gameplay of Romance of the Three Kingdoms effectively reduces the burden of information recognition for players, highlights the important information that players really need in strategic analysis, and greatly optimizes the map information interaction experience while improving interaction efficiency. </p>

<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>As the main body of player-game interaction and the key carrier of interaction between players, the SLG game sand table battlefield not only carries the logical framework of the entire game, ensures the harmony and unity of the screen style and theme setting, but also takes into account the player’s interaction experience and provides corresponding support controls. It can be said to be the most basic and most worthy of repeated consideration in SLG games.</p>
<p>This article mainly focuses on the information interaction of the sand table battlefield, and briefly discusses the underlying logic of its sand table type, the interaction design of map elements, the connotation mining of marching markers, and the design iteration of the strategic map from the perspective of user experience. So far, the problems to be solved and the contradictions to be coordinated in the SLG sand table map still exist. It is believed that with the development and progress of the industry, better competing products or updates will bring a better game experience to players.</p>
