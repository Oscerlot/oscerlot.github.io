<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Besides the game’s own fun and playability, the speed at which novice players get started is also one of the major factors that determine the fate of a game. In the player’s onboarding phase, the game designer has a lot of information that needs to be communicated to the player, including the story background, game goals, basic operations, etc., which is the so-called “novice guidance”. The transmission of such information requires interaction designers to make ingenious designs to ensure its accuracy and fluency, so as to minimize the player’s memory burden, improve acceptance and onboarding efficiency, and then make the player have the willingness to continue playing.</p>
<p>This article will discuss several key points of interaction design that need to be paid attention to in novice guidance, and analyze them in combination with cases.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative"><a href="#1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative"></a>1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative</h2><p>First, we need to understand two related concepts. “Weakly positive” and “strongly negative”.</p>
<p>“Weakly positive” means that it is extremely difficult for novice guidance to gain the attention and favor of players. Although excellent novice guidance will allow players to complete the onboarding phase efficiently and smoothly, and have a willingness to continue playing the game, because it is a guide when entering a game, it does not occupy a dominant position like the game’s own plot advancement, so players do not often pay attention to this novice guidance, nor do they often pay attention to the changes in their attitude towards the game during this stage, and they do not often make positive comments such as “the novice guidance of this game is really good”.</p>
<p>“Strongly negative” means that if a novice guide is not done well, it is very likely to directly dissuade novice players. Novice guidance is equivalent to the gate of the whole game. If the threshold is too high, or the receptionist is too tough, leading visitors to visit hand in hand, and so on, visitors are very likely to become dissatisfied and leave. Novice guidance receives less attention, but it is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance"><a href="#2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance"></a>2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance</h2><h3 id="Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance"><a href="#Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Non-mandatory: Open Guidance"></a>Non-mandatory: Open Guidance</h3><p>When encountering a new game, players often encounter “nanny-level” novice tutorials - the screen pauses, a conspicuous arrow appears on the interface to guide the player to click here (and only this place is interactive, unable to exit), and there are text descriptions of varying lengths. Obviously, this method is too rigid and will easily reduce the player’s favorability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some players may have already learned about the game through other accounts, watching game videos, etc., so they do not need to learn the novice guidance, which designers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, good novice guidance interaction should be non-mandatory and open. Players can freely explore in the game scene and spontaneously complete the learning of interaction methods. Of course, in some games under specific categories, or in some parts of the game’s novice guidance, mandatory guidance is more applicable, because this form can relatively effectively ensure that all players master and understand certain key mechanisms or story plots.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Stray</em>, the play between kittens is used as the beginning of the story. Because it was raining at that time, the kittens’ activities were limited to the cave that could shelter from the rain, but in this space, players can freely explore and learn basic actions such as walking and interacting with other cats. Except for the necessary key prompts, there are no obvious interactions set in this scene, and players seem to have integrated into the open world of cats without human language. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Rainy night, players freely interact with NPCs in the cave</em></p>

<h3 id="Learning-Through-Practice"><a href="#Learning-Through-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Learning Through Practice"></a>Learning Through Practice</h3><p>Novice tutorials are not necessarily textbook-like systematic teaching. It can also break through the inherent form and integrate into actual combat, learning through practice. Therefore, what we describe as “novice tutorials” may be more appropriately referred to as “novice guidance”. Players gradually learn a variety of skills and gameplay as the plot progresses, which is very helpful for the smoothness and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Necessary prompts and interactions should be integrated into the scene, which can be viewed by players at any time, and hardly affect the progress of their game.</p>
<p>In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, there is no formed novice tutorial, but learning while playing. When players play for the first time, they will fall into one of the pre-selected maps - Mansion (of course it is the simplest of all maps), and directly start exploring the game world. During the process, players will occasionally encounter conspicuous orange items on the ground. When it is picked up, a projection screen-like floating animation appears in the scene, teaching players the relevant operations at this moment. Whether to pick it up and when to put it down is entirely up to the player, respecting and encouraging players to explore on their own. </p>

<p><em>Pick up the “tutorial video” to play the guidance content</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Toto Temple Deluxe</em>, there is a very important dash action, which needs to be pressed “arrow keys + dash key” to complete. The training of this action has already begun before the game - game settings, mode selection and other preparations all need to control the villain to dash to complete the interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F07a26c5a-63b6-456f-abd4-5366ae8296fe.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Ingenious-Unconscious-Design"><a href="#Ingenious-Unconscious-Design" class="headerlink" title="Ingenious Unconscious Design"></a>Ingenious Unconscious Design</h3><p>To make the novice guidance more brilliant, it is necessary to design more hidden teaching elements and methods that players are not aware of.</p>
<p>Unconscious action is an action that a person can make without much thought and subconsciously. Unconscious design is an extremely simple design that captures this natural characteristic of users. It does not require a lot of artificially added interaction, and can quickly guide users to unconsciously complete a certain task. Applying it to the game novice tutorial can be roughly summarized as: using natural and ingenious implicit interaction to guide players.</p>
<p>In <em>Stray</em>, cans begin to appear on the kitten’s path, prompting the player to push them down from a height. At first, this action did not produce any feedback from the event. When the player was confused, they thought of the reality that kittens are like this, unreasonably pushing things off the table, cute and mischievous. This method not only evokes a strong resonance from the player, but also teaches the player the correct use of cans in the game. Then, a glass skylight blocked the way, and there happened to be a can on the high platform above it… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F8e005b5c-ac02-49b2-9857-56f564d83bfc.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Itchy kitten learns to push the can down and break the glass to create an entrance</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After clicking the confirm button in the <em>Mega Man X</em> menu, a small animation of the protagonist shooting a bullet will appear on the left side of the button. This implies that the “confirm button” represents “fire bullet”. After entering the game, the process of teaching players how to fire bullets is omitted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F095b15a1-8ea8-4a15-a73f-b84e64819505.gif/size/"></p>

<p>Like the teaching of all knowledge and skills, game tutorials cannot output all the gameplay and rules of this game to novice players at once. When they first come into contact with new things, players need a process of understanding and acceptance. In this process, the game designer leads the player from easy to difficult, from simple to complex, and gradually enters the worldview of this game.</p>
<p>For example, one of the important contents of the ocean exploration game <em>Dave The Diver</em> is to go to the sea to fish. The game first teaches players the most basic left-click stab, and then long-press the right-click to shoot the harpoon, and then gradually teaches players to use various complex weapons. The number of skills mastered by players steadily increases during this period, and it is easier to obtain a sense of phased achievement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ff8a6d659-eee4-4ad4-9a10-cd04f096f490.gif/size/"></p>

<p>● <strong>Designer: Pay Attention to Interface Cleanliness and Logic</strong></p>
<p>Phased teaching can better prompt designers to pay special attention to the conciseness and logic of information transmission.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that if the designer has not paid attention to this principle, it is very likely that a large amount of information will appear on the same interface at the same time in the game, making the player unable to start, not knowing which panel to read first, and what is the relationship between them.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the designer understands the principle of phased teaching from beginning to end, he will split, classify, and present the complicated information on this panel to novice players step by step according to a certain event logic. In this way, the process of players getting started with a new game will be more interlocked, like reading a story.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Game types can be subdivided almost infinitely, and there are too many to enumerate. Although many novice guidance principles are generally applicable to different games, it is not difficult to find some differences when comparing them carefully. For example, action-oriented games focus on the training of skills and combos, which may be integrated into various corners that players cannot imagine; puzzle-adventure games focus on allowing players to explore spontaneously, so as to minimize obvious guidance.</p>
<p>Excellent game novice tutorials need to respect the needs of players, allow players to explore on their own in a relatively free space, and naturally integrate prompts or interactions into the scene when necessary. In this way, the novice tutorial is sublimated, no longer in its inherent form, but perfectly integrated with the game itself, even reaching the level that players can hardly realize that this is a kind of teaching. Players gradually learn specific skills during the game, step by step, significantly improving the efficiency of getting started, and can more deeply experience the sense of phased achievement.</p>
