</blockquote>
<p>Various psychological principles and phenomena, such as “flow”, have long been closely linked to the video game industry and have rich applications in it. In this article, we will combine specific game cases to explain how the “flow” phenomenon and the positive psychology theory behind it are introduced by game designers to support the game player experience.</p>
<p>First, let’s understand what positive psychology is.</p>
<h2 id="1-About-Positive-Psychology"><a href="#1-About-Positive-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="1. About Positive Psychology"></a>1. About Positive Psychology</h2><p>The core of positive psychology research is what makes life valuable and meaningful. As a discipline, it examines assumptions about what can improve our lives. Its research paradigm is no different from traditional psychology, only the focus of research is different: the traditional psychology field studies “what problems have occurred in human psychology” and tries to find ways to make them less painful; but the goal of positive psychology is to make ordinary life more fulfilling. It focuses on people’s strengths and explores what makes life happier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F1e395bbc-febe-4495-bc39-2e974a211650.png/size/"></p>
<p>Positive psychology is an important supplement to traditional psychology, focusing on the well-being of all mankind. Through its practice, we can be more actively involved in life and find the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>The core question of positive psychology research is how to make people happy, and this is the common fulcrum with video games. In the process of playing video games, players actively exert their rich and diverse strengths and skills to overcome difficulties; they empathize with the characters in the game, thus creating emotional connections; video games will also give them corresponding feedback, so that they can get a wonderful sense of happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what factors affect happiness and apply them to industry practices.</p>
<p>So what factors affect people’s happiness? In 2011, the father of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, proposed the very famous PERMA model in his book to explain the factors that affect happiness, and at the same time better define and explain “what is happiness”.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples"><a href="#2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples" class="headerlink" title="2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples"></a>2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples</h2><p>Professor Seligman, the “father of positive psychology”, believes that happiness consists of five elements: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0d4203fe-cd70-4b96-b147-ce0746fce43b.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Positive-Emotion"><a href="#Positive-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Positive Emotion"></a>Positive Emotion</h3><p>Studies have pointed out that positive emotions greatly affect the way we view the world. When the level of positive emotions is high, the level of creativity, courage, and optimism will increase: this means that players have stronger control performance in the game. At the same time, under the influence of positive emotions, players have higher cognition and evaluation of the game, and gain more satisfaction and happiness in the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to highlight the elements that can make people feel happy in the game and use them to mobilize the player’s positive emotions. For example, the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series produces a refreshing feeling for players during the race through the detailed depiction of the natural scenery of the United Kingdom and Mexico; the recent White Snake Legend co-branded fashion of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> stimulates players’ sense of national cultural pride and ownership while providing players with a beautiful visual experience. </p>

<h3 id="Engagement"><a href="#Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Engagement"></a>Engagement</h3><p>What makes you immersed in the game and even forget the time?</p>
<p>It is the “flow” mentioned earlier, proposed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, another founder of positive psychology. In positive psychology and PERMA theory, “flow” describes a state of immersion in the present and full engagement. When players are engaged, their energy and concentration increase at the same time. However, the state of flow is not something that can be entered casually. The game needs to meet the following three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game itself should be rewarding, and players tend to play the game. This is the big premise.</li>
<li>The challenges in the game should take into account the player’s ability. The challenges match the ability, which makes the player more engaged.</li>
<li>Players should feel that they have control over the game during the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F7da88dd9-07ff-4936-b2e8-984548ea61d2.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> and the <em>Civilization</em> series, which have always been regarded as industry benchmarks in the flow experience, also do well in these three points:</p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> provides players with a hearty gaming experience of cutting into flesh, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with a gaming experience of development and growth, and overall planning;</p>
<p>The difficulty of <em>Sekiro</em> is just on the upper side of the challenge-ability line of most players, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with up to 8 custom difficulties;</p>
<p>In <em>Sekiro</em>, players play the role of the ninja “Wolf” and constantly improve their combos and reactions during the game. In <em>Civilization</em>, players play the role of the supreme leader of a civilization and constantly optimize the best development strategy during the game.</p>
<p>Although <em>Sekiro</em> and <em>Civilization</em> belong to the action category and strategy category respectively, both have achieved the ultimate in their own fields, creating an immersive game experience for players. </p>

<h3 id="Relationship"><a href="#Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Relationship"></a>Relationship</h3><p>The revolutionary mentor Marx said: “Man is the sum of social relations.” Human beings are social animals and always have the need to maintain connections with others, hoping to have spiritual communication with others. At the same time, good interpersonal relationships often bring people a broader vision, stronger external support and a more stable psychological state.</p>
<p>The selection of game materials is rich and diverse, and naturally it will not lack the description of various social relations in various themes. Whether it is the deep emotional bond established between players and NPCs in single-player games, or the cooperative or competitive relationship established between players in online multiplayer games, it provides unique emotional experiences for players who love this type of game.</p>
<p>In the open-world single-player game <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> with a Western magical background, players will embark on the adventure of the Dragonborn. Among them, Lydia, the first companion encountered in Whiterun, is the partner of most players from beginning to end, accompanying the player to enter dark caves, sweep bandit strongholds, block knives and arrows for the player, share the burden of luggage for the player, share the ups and downs with the player, and accompany the player to travel all over the land of Skyrim. Because of this, Lydia has become almost one of the most talked about characters in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> and is deeply loved by players. In community-organized polls, Lydia firmly holds the title of “Most Popular Marriage Partner in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim”, which shows the deep emotional connection players have with her. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F503cd314-cc2d-4886-9426-f042c3cfdb62.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Battlefield 1</em>, which focuses on large maps and large battlefields, each battle is based on the historical battles of World War I. Players are divided into camps of 32 people, representing a participating country in World War I to fight for the country. At the beginning of the game, the monologue of the soldiers from that camp will be played to unify the players’ identification with the camp. In the game, players from the same country will mainly generate social links by helping each other, cross-covering, and coordinating charges. The gunfire and the bugle will firmly unite the players’ belief in “fighting for the country”. The grandeur of the charge, the bond between comrades-in-arms, and the belief in the country are all condensed in the short 20-minute game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F6884749b-98a0-49bd-8b55-7d45db135332.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Meaning-and-Purpose"><a href="#Meaning-and-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Meaning and Purpose"></a>Meaning and Purpose</h3><p>When a player has a clear goal, the goal will stimulate the player’s state. When the player has a clear sense of meaning and purpose, he will actively start thinking about how to do better, thus entering the positive cycle of “player input-game feedback-player thinking-player re-input”.</p>
<p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, the winner of the 2021 TGA Game of the Year, two players will play the role of Cody and May, a couple whose relationship is on the verge of breaking down. After another family quarrel, they are turned into dolls that their daughter cannot see by the daughter’s “Book of Love”. On the surface level, the player’s goal is to control the characters through the tasks set by the “Book of Love”, and finally return to their bodies and see their daughter; on the deeper level, the player’s goal is to let the two characters re-recognize and familiarize themselves with each other in the process of passing the levels, find the reason for loving each other, and thus save this family on the verge of breaking up. The pursuit of superficial meaning leads them on a journey of personal growth, thereby finding deeper meaning. The player’s play process is therefore tinged with a sense of mission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F155b4d55-78a1-4d35-bc6a-b339990c2fcb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Accomplishment"><a href="#Accomplishment" class="headerlink" title="Accomplishment"></a>Accomplishment</h3><p>Positive psychology believes that a sense of accomplishment can better improve a person’s resilience and optimism, and make people more courageous in the face of setbacks. Similarly, in the game, appropriately giving feedback to players on small achievements and big achievements can enhance players’ acceptance of challenges and resilience, increase their sense of gain and satisfaction during the game, and at the same time strengthen their motivation to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>The horizontal profile survival game <em>This War of Mine</em> won more than 100 international awards with its cold style, rigorous excavation of history and profound humanistic thinking. It starts from the perspective of small people in the war, takes the real event of the Siege of Sarajevo as the background, and makes players feel the pain, helplessness, and powerlessness of people in the war through a piece of microscopic cruel reality. This also makes the game have strong negative feedback on the player experience. Through the settlement of the small achievements of the player’s daily acquisition of materials and the settlement of the great achievements after the final clearance, the player can get hope for the next day’s survival and the motivation to explore the second week, reducing the risk of players giving up when facing negative emergencies. </p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Sid Meier, the master of the game industry, said at the 2010 GDC Game Developers Conference: “Games are a psychological experience”, which profoundly reveals the inseparable link between video games and psychology. The video game industry has developed to this day, and it has to be admitted that its greatest charm for game players is that it creates a rich, complex, immersive, and empathetic psychological experience for players. Although the psychological factors of the game process are not as dazzling as the game’s picture quality and action effects, its existence is the spiritual core of the interactive art of games.</p>
