<p>For a game released globally, understanding the needs of overseas users is crucial, whether during the development or operational phase. Especially when we need to stand from a more macro perspective, understanding the target market users’ product cognition, behavioral characteristics, gaming habits, and content preferences, the traditional research method of questionnaire surveys becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Questionnaire surveys can achieve understanding of all the above information in a relatively short period of time. And launching questionnaires in the game is a very effective method in the process of game development and user research, with characteristics such as “relatively low cost, relatively short time, and relatively fast conclusions.” In this article, we will tell you how to conduct the most efficient questionnaire surveys and provide some tips to avoid pitfalls when doing player research in overseas markets.</p>
<h2 id="1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games"><a href="#1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Multi-language Classification in Games"></a>1. Multi-language Classification in Games</h2><p>Multi-language classification is always essential in globally released games. However, we face a choice: which languages should we use? Let’s first look at the number of speakers of each language in the world. Besides Chinese, English (1 billion), Spanish (570 million), Hindi (540 million), Arabic (420 million), Malay (280 million), French (270 million), Bengali (270 million), Russian (270 million), and Portuguese (250 million) are the most spoken languages. Moving to games, let’s look at two examples, the enduring <em>GTA5</em> and the recent masterpiece <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, both of which are AAA-level masterpieces from world-renowned manufacturers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F71487fa7-4701-495d-86e4-d254fec9b182.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2Fa7bc2442-2b27-4a84-ad57-4a5b0c466433.png/size/"></p>
<p>As you can see, in these two games, the very populous languages Hindi (540 million), Malay (280 million), and Bengali (270 million) are invariably ignored. In addition, <em>GTA5</em> does not have Arabic. Instead, both games have German (180 million), Japanese (130 million), Italian (100 million), Korean (80 million), and Polish (50 million). The total number of speakers of these five languages is roughly equal to the number of Hindi speakers. Therefore, the choice of languages to adopt in the game is obviously not simply based on the number of speakers.</p>
<p>So, is it because of the purchasing power of players? Not necessarily. Among the 18 countries in the Arabic-speaking region, the combined GDP of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and Qatar alone is about the same as that of Italy. Among them, Saudi Arabia’s per capita GDP has reached 24,000 US dollars, and its consumption power is not much different from that of developed countries, not to mention Qatar, a country with a per capita GDP of more than 60,000 US dollars. Despite this, Arabic still does not appear in <em>GTA5</em>‘s language list. However, the potential player consumption power of this country also allows us to see the demand for Arabic from <em>GTA5</em> players in the Middle East on forums. Therefore, the language chosen by the game is not necessarily completely related to the purchasing power of players or specific regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F8690d5eb-ce73-4814-bbcb-e8668ac488c6.png/size/"></p>
<p>Faced with the demands of so many languages, the in-game language and the language of the in-game questionnaire must have made corresponding trade-offs and balances.</p>
<h2 id="2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires"><a href="#2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires" class="headerlink" title="2. Multi-language in Questionnaires"></a>2. Multi-language in Questionnaires</h2><p>So, how do you determine which languages to localize for overseas questionnaires? Let’s first look at the example of Arabic. Why haven’t many successful domestic games launched overseas done Arabic localization?</p>
<p>From the environment outside the game, although the video game industry and game culture in Arab countries are developing rapidly and there are many national support policies, they are still in the initial stage and have not been fully rolled out.  At the same time, although the Gulf countries are rich, the gap between the rich and the poor is very serious, and some countries are still in long-term war. Finally, many cultures or doctrines in Arab countries also conflict with game content or worldviews. Many manufacturers find it difficult to customize game content specifically for the Arab region in order to pursue efficiency and security.</p>
<p>From inside the game, students who have seen Arabic and have done game localization must know that Arabic localization is a thankless task: because of the different writing habits (from right to left) and different lengths of words and sentences, the UI design has to be almost redone for localization. The questionnaire system is no exception. Everything is read from right to left, and even the text will be “broken”. In addition, there are many religious and cultural nuances to be considered. Thus, the processing cost is huge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F28166350-8ddc-46c1-a5cb-38eeee8a755a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Breaking it down further into the design of overseas questionnaires, the core is still the same: the cost issue.</p>
<p>For a game like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which has already been launched and is operating, it currently supports 13 languages. When launching a questionnaire overseas for research, is it necessary to design corresponding 13 languages?</p>
<p>The answer is no. Ideally, it would be best if each language and its corresponding country or region had its own easily accessible questionnaire, but this would cause us to lose a great deal of timeliness: when considering horizontal comparisons between Chinese and foreign players, the questionnaire needs to be translated from Chinese to English after the needs are disassembled&#x2F;confirmed and the questions are designed, and then English is used as a bridge language to translate into various minor languages for distribution. Such a schedule often takes at least 1-2 weeks. After the questionnaire results are collected and the data is processed, it is necessary to compare and analyze 13 questionnaires in different languages, which is very cumbersome and error-prone, and may require the intervention of suppliers at this time. In this way, a questionnaire takes nearly a month to obtain valid data and conclusions, and players and the development team have long forgotten what they wanted to verify or investigate before, which will inevitably bring great timeliness problems.</p>
<p>In addition, considering that the number of players in different regions may vary greatly, when the number of samples collected for a certain minor language is limited, we must also consider the reliability and validity of the entire questionnaire when processing data. Feedback from a small number of player groups is very likely to provide biased conclusions or insights in a questionnaire that requires a large sample size, which is an important issue to consider in market and user research.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make some trade-offs. The first thing to consider is the number of online players in the game. To give an extreme example, if we have to choose between Japanese and Korean, and there are 1,000 players using Japanese and only 50 players using Korean, then we will undoubtedly give up including Korean in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>So, you might ask, what about Korean players? At this time, an English questionnaire can be used as a permanent alternative. Even if there are fewer English players, this universal language is always the “last home” for global players, and the same is true for overseas questionnaires. In the design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s overseas questionnaires, we will, considering the schedule of the localization team, add 2-3 minor languages on the basis of Chinese and English, combined with the number of online players, translation costs, and regional characteristics, as the final questionnaire launch.</p>
<h2 id="3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries"><a href="#3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries" class="headerlink" title="3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries"></a>3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries</h2><p>After arranging the multi-language questionnaire, let’s talk about the specific design of the questionnaire survey. The core point to pay attention to in this link is: Chinese players have their own unique game culture atmosphere, and other countries also have their own beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, when designing demographic questions, in addition to male and female genders in English questions, we also referred to the Inclusive Forms on gender proposed by UBC’s Equity &amp; Inclusion Office, adding gender options such as “non-binary” to the questions, and in fact, some players did choose this. On the other hand, in the Japanese and Korean language questionnaires, after consulting with localizers in those countries, if options other than male and female are added to the questions, players may feel a little strange, so we still only retain the traditional three options of “male&#x2F;female&#x2F;prefer not to disclose”, which also reflects the difference in values between East Asia and Europe and America. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F19652e40-1121-4403-b22a-de8c04ac5fba.png/size/"></p>
<p>This difference can also be reflected in the specific options of in-game questionnaires. If the option in a certain question is “good-looking hosts and commentators”, this is a relatively common situation in China. Because whether it is the high-end CCTV Spring Festival Gala host or the live broadcast anchors who are closer to life, these people are often good-looking and have good temperament, and the audience will not have any objections. However, when the same option appears in a European or American questionnaire, players may raise some objections. After all, in current European and American games, such as the protagonist of the console game <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the female characters in <em>Apex Legends</em>, they are already more diversified and no longer follow the sexy route like Lara Croft before. This gradual “different paths leading to different destinations” in aesthetics and differences in habits between the East and the West will also affect the setting of questions and options in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>In addition to similar value differences, the unique attributes of domestic questionnaires also need to be noted. For example, the “H5 page” option in domestic questionnaires is not well understood by overseas players. If it is literally translated as “H5” or “H5 page”, foreign players will be confused. At this time, we must consider whether to replace the option, or directly delete the option (when it is judged that it is less used in the region), or put it in the “other” option for players to fill in by themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0f89ec1b-b6d9-4a49-ab62-24659d723151.png/size/"></p>
<p>Of course, some of the most basic things, such as replacing domestic social platforms and media with overseas counterparts, will not be repeated here, but one thing to consider is: it is not just a matter of replacing them with a fixed set of content, but each language questionnaire should be localized according to the usage characteristics of that country. For example, “Allah” cannot appear in Arabic, this word cannot have the Christian cross; in German localization, “SS tier” needs to be considered more carefully when expressing equipment quality because “SS” is the abbreviation of Nazi “Schutzstaffel”, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is some preliminary discussion on the design and launch of overseas questionnaires. To sum up, a very important point is the word “trade-off”. Doing overseas research is of course important, but how to conduct questionnaire research efficiently during the research process is also something we need to consider. We can make corresponding optimal decisions according to the actual situation of our own games.</p>
