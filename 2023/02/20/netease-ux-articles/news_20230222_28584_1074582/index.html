<p>Horror games, a genre that has endured since the birth of gaming, remain a favorite of many game enthusiasts. While our rational minds tell us to avoid fear in pursuit of happiness, the chilling, trembling feeling we get in the dark provides a thrilling and captivating experience.</p>
<p>Horror games are truly a love-hate affair. When you’re not playing them, you’re intrigued by the sense of curiosity, but when you are, you’re constantly gripped by fear.  From classics like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>, to the rising tide of Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em>, <em>Paper Dolls</em>, and <em>Paper Bride</em>, this genre has always had titles that touch players’ nerves.  Even when scared pale, players persevere to complete the entire story.  What is the driving force behind players’ dedication. </p>

<h2 id="1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games"><a href="#1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?"></a>1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?</h2><h3 id="Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster"><a href="#Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster" class="headerlink" title="Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster"></a>Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster</h3><p>Horror games aim to shock or frighten the audience through narrative devices such as pain and supernatural phenomena. Players experience anxiety and even disgust, accompanied by a series of physiological reactions, such as trembling, jumping, covering their eyes, and an increased heart rate, resulting in feelings of fear.  When faced with terror, the sympathetic nervous system is aroused, activating the fight-or-flight response, and the level of adrenaline in the body surges.  However, people usually don’t immediately flee danger. The brain assesses the surrounding environment, and after realizing there is no immediate danger, emotions relax, providing a sense of release.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s like a roller coaster. You experience a range of emotions, such as anticipation and tension, and then, under the stimulation of adrenaline, a series of physiological reactions occur, such as accelerated blood flow, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, dilated pupils, and focused attention on self-preservation. The brain and body prepare to react to perceived threats with greater strength and speed. After assessing that there is no real life-threatening danger, dopamine and endorphins are activated, resulting in a thrilling pleasure and mental catharsis.</p>
<p>Horror games take full advantage of this by manipulating and teasing the senses, scaring you, and then providing a moment of relief. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F639e7cda-5341-45e8-bf0b-264751299fa1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms"><a href="#Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms"></a>Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms</h3><p>Imagine you’re running for your life in the game world of <em>Resident Evil</em>, your health bar is almost empty, you don’t have many supplies left, and to make matters worse, there’s a猙狞 (zhēngníng - ferocious,狰狞) looking tracker who wants to kill you immediately following you.  At this point, you just want to run into the nearest safe room. When you hear the beautiful melody, you breathe a sigh of relief. This safe room design and the overwhelming sense of relief are actually key elements that make horror games appealing.  After experiencing an adrenaline rush and successfully escaping danger, with the release of dopamine, the player’s tension is relieved, muscles relax, and there is often an “electrified” effect after the fright.</p>
<p>Dolf Zillmann’s “Excitation-Transfer Theory” explains this cycle of tension and relief. Because horror games can effectively make players feel fear and unease, when they get rid of fear, the subsequent feeling of relief from excitement is amplified. This is why many games have safe room designs, not only to provide players with a safe haven from harm, but also to enhance the player’s emotions and strengthen the experience. </p>

<h2 id="2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts"><a href="#2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?"></a>2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?</h2><p>So, since our bodies physiologically determine that when we face fear, a sense of excitement or fun will naturally follow the feeling of terror, how do games create horror?</p>
<p>In today’s horror games, even the traditional Western-style bloody and straightforward scares, which emphasize the visual horror created by zombies and mutants, are just auxiliary tools. Atmosphere and immersion are what games pursue, by finding resonance with players to achieve the purpose of engagement.</p>
<h3 id="Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions"><a href="#Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions"></a>Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions</h3><p>Through modern medical scanning techniques, the brain regions involved in emotional processing, which in horror games correspond to fear recognition or processing, are most related to the amygdala and hippocampus. Horror games are not 100% jump scares and terrifying murders. Games like to leave you in suspense, which is where elements like suspense and sound design come into play.  When eerie music enters the ears, even without directly seeing terrifying images and things, it sends a signal to our nervous system, the amygdala is activated to produce fear. At this time, we don’t have any background clues to explain what we should be afraid of, and the hippocampus will retrieve memories and fill in the blanks based on our personal fears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F7bb137fc-2f5b-4594-b087-1d45355cd4c1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories"><a href="#Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories"></a>Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories</h3><p>So, what are we afraid of in our memories?  Each cultural context has its own corresponding “nightmares”, such as the chainsaw murderers in Europe and America, Sadako in Japan, and Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil. These are often the design prototypes in various horror games. Or, like the ghost marriages and red candles and paper money in Chinese horror, we instinctively feel a chill and our hearts race.  For example, most people are afraid of dimly lit environments, sudden ringing phones, baby cries, and other scenes, which are guaranteed to scare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Fdd26971f-807a-41bb-83b7-58e94d76a9e6.png/size/"></p>
<p>The most terrifying things often happen in familiar areas. When a horror game takes place in a familiar building, and the game creates a depressing atmosphere, accompanied by a slow-paced early game and a large number of puzzle-solving elements, then it gives the player a fatal blow at the climax of the plot.  Although there are not so many sensory stimuli, it will make you replay it in your mind.  This chilling fear is the most charming part of psychological horror, making countless players “unable to stop”.</p>
<h2 id="3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players"><a href="#3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players"></a>3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players</h2><p>In recent years, the resurgence of horror games, and the reboot trend, is also thanks to the rise of the streaming industry.</p>
<p>Horror games seem to be born for streaming, naturally suitable for creating content. Streamers have also perfectly interpreted “the more cowardly, the more addicted”. This has further promoted the prevalence of horror games in the streaming industry. After all, which streamer doesn’t like outstanding “streaming effects”?  Unlike other games, narrative-based games require the entire playthrough to be watched for story appreciation, and strategy games require long-term experience to truly engage. Horror games are different. When streamers show their off-guard reactions on screen, it brings a strong sense of comedic contrast to the audience, while also driving traffic for the streamer and providing free advertising for the game, allowing horror games, which were once niche and only suitable for private experience, to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>For example, popular Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em> and <em>Paper Dolls</em> have been played by well-known streamers like PDD, Qiezi, and even some esports players during their streams.  Or, when searching for horror games on Bilibili, you will also find many videos of streamers playing or explaining the game.  The rise of new media such as live streaming and video has indeed injected a boost into the horror industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F64aabcd3-1b88-4822-b5ad-2dbf10e5901c.png/size/"></p>
<p>As a viewer, when you have a favorite streamer who screams in terror while playing this game, you will naturally be interested in this game and take the initiative to learn about horror games. Human emotions are interconnected, and joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness can easily be spread to others through various forms. As a viewer, I might be scared to play, but I’m definitely not afraid to watch a stream.  When the streamer is startled, the audience will also feel their palms sweat, which is also a kind of emotional connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort"><a href="#4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort" class="headerlink" title="4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort"></a>4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort</h2><p>Horror games, as a broad category, may include various gameplay forms in their core. However, in the external presentation of these games, developers need to be wary of cruel and extreme art design. Causing players physiological discomfort may detract from the visual experience.  From the terrifying presentation of monsters, the basic principles of their construction, and the player’s coping methods, more in-depth design should be carried out, and early combination with player testing for corresponding adjustments can reduce the risk of negative reviews in later releases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F5f04f593-8306-4502-97e1-661b709e543d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Last December, <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, created by the main creators of <em>Dead Space</em>, was released and was considered by many players to be the spiritual successor to <em>Dead Space</em>. Although in terms of art design, the development team fully utilized the performance of next-generation consoles, and based on the company’s strengths (the producer is an art director), the visual effects were greatly improved, but some players experienced physiological discomfort and the singular horror and combat experience created by the game did not receive very good reviews.</p>
<h2 id="5-Will-Horror-Continue"><a href="#5-Will-Horror-Continue" class="headerlink" title="5. Will Horror Continue?"></a>5. Will Horror Continue?</h2><p>For a game, repeatedly stacking horror elements does not guarantee success. As mentioned above, when players enter the feedback loop of expecting fear, sudden fright, and releasing happiness in the safe room, the fear response is constantly triggered.  This feedback loop often exists in every horror game. After you face a hellhound that has scared you once, the second time you encounter a similar scene, your brain is prepared for that moment, just like a drug, you develop “tolerance.”</p>
<p>When we activate the fight-or-flight response, a complex neurotransmitter response is activated, producing a neurochemical cascade. Like drugs, long-term use requires more of the drug to produce the effect.  Thrill-seeking players may also develop increased “fear tolerance,” thus requiring more and more fear stimulation to produce the desired response.</p>
<p>As most players say, a certain game has nothing new and is always “rehashing old ideas”. For horror games, if they want to endure and win the hearts of players, they also need to change the way they scare, otherwise players will only say “this plot design is the same as xxx”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ffb714065-c86c-4d89-9a28-4bcec46fb00a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Currently, many horror games have attracted a lot of attention. However, the cruel fact contrary to high popularity is that most current horror games are critically acclaimed but not commercially successful. The reason is still simply “scares”.  They are both afraid and curious, so instead of playing themselves, most people prefer to watch others play with the protection of bullet comments (referring to live comments that scroll across the screen on streaming platforms).</p>
<p>But now, with more expressive forms and gameplay attracting players to horror games, more and more players want to try them.  Initially, they may be scared and develop resistance to the game, but now, after seeing new and unique horror elements and gameplay, they may develop new interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps horror games still cannot shake the market position of other game genres, but under the trend of the times, horror games still have great potential. We also look forward to more powerful technology, more diverse scenes and gameplay being introduced into horror games. </p>
