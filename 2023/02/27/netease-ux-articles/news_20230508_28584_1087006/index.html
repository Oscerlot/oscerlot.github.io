<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the past, many people believed that colors had some kind of mysterious power. Modern psychologists also believe that colors are related to the human brain and have a profound impact on human emotions and behavior. Data shows that when people observe objects, the first 20 seconds are basically spent on the appearance, of which the perception of color accounts for 85%, and the perception of shape accounts for 15%; after two minutes, the color drops to 75%, and after 5 minutes, it tends to be half and half.</p>
<p>The impression color gives to people is rapid, profound, and lasting, which also determines what the first impression of many things is. This article will combine color knowledge and the practical application of color in game design to reveal the answer one by one. Is color psychology really pseudoscience?</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts"><a href="#1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Color to Convey Concepts"></a>1. Using Color to Convey Concepts</h2><h3 id="Physical-Characteristics"><a href="#Physical-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Physical Characteristics"></a>Physical Characteristics</h3><p>On the basis of the same elements or shapes, using different color schemes will present different themes. The well-known art concept designer OLDFISH also emphasized the importance of physical characteristics presented through colors for concept communication. At the same time, colors will also produce differences in material communication. The same shape can be expressed as silver, gold and other materials by giving different inherent colors and light and shadow relationships.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Characteristics"><a href="#Cultural-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Characteristics"></a>Cultural Characteristics</h3><p>Some specific colors can express certain cultural characteristics. When people habitually give a specific meaning to a certain group of colors and continue to use them, over time, they will become the symbolic color of this thing, most commonly seen in religion, aristocratic culture, ancient class systems, and customs.</p>
<p>The same color may represent different or even completely opposite meanings in different cultural backgrounds. These cultural connotations related to color will also be reflected in the design of some games. For example, in Chinese culture, red often represents festivity and good luck, while in some Western contexts it sometimes symbolizes violence, blood, and tension. Therefore, in many game scenes with an oriental background, redwood buildings or red decorations often appear, while game scenes with a Western background are relatively rare, mainly using original wood colors, gray, beige, etc. as the main color scheme of residential buildings. Of course, scene design is largely related to the era in which the game background&#x2F;worldview is located and the theme of the game itself, but as an important element in different cultures, color can also inspire many different design ideas for artists.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Characteristics"><a href="#Emotional-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Characteristics"></a>Emotional Characteristics</h3><p>The influence of color on people’s emotions is subtle, and the psychological implications of different colors are also different. To give some common examples in life, the color scheme of many fast food restaurants is red and yellow, giving people a fast-paced psychological suggestion; while hospital rooms are usually decorated in white, light blue and other light colors, which can give people a sense of stability and comfort, which is conducive to soothing emotions.</p>
<p>In the process of game design, color is also a direct and powerful way to evoke players’ emotions. Research on some players by an organization shows that yellow usually means “fun” in the hearts of players, while red usually means “anger”. Of course, these studies are not absolute, but can represent a certain color design trend, which is inseparable from the player’s psychological state. But it is undeniable that the use of different colors can indeed evoke certain specific emotions in people’s hearts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Contrasting-Color-Matching"><a href="#2-Contrasting-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrasting Color Matching"></a>2. Contrasting Color Matching</h2><p>According to the strength of the contrast of color attributes, color matching can be roughly divided into complementary colors, contrasting colors, and medium-difference colors. The stronger the contrast of color matching, the higher the recognition between colors. Many game artists use this principle to design scenes, character costumes, etc., which makes it easier to cut the picture and make the strong and weak distinct.</p>
<h3 id="Complementary-Colors"><a href="#Complementary-Colors" class="headerlink" title="Complementary Colors"></a>Complementary Colors</h3><p>Usually, we define colors with an angle of 180° on the color wheel as complementary colors, which is commonly known as “contrasting colors”. Complementary colors have the largest range of hue changes, and the resulting picture color contrast is also the strongest, thus giving people a strong visual impact. But in art design, this also means “high risk”. Too strong a contrast can easily cause disharmony and overstimulation, and it is likely to “step on thunder”.</p>
<p>However, as long as it is properly grasped, “high risk will also bring high returns”, resulting in unexpected aesthetic innovation. Usually, complementary colors have extremely strong contrast and conflict. Therefore, the use of complementary color matching is generally more challenging. Usually, the method of changing the area ratio or saturation is used to present a better visual effect.</p>
<p>Blue and orange, yellow and purple are common complementary color combinations. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the costumes of the hero Kurumi have always been the focus of players’ attention. The blue and orange complementary colors used on the chest, sleeves, and waist seal of the Chengyun Lanshou (承云兰寿) have a finishing touch effect, and at the same time set off the lively and clever character image; Huiye Shaonu (辉烨少女) uses a large area of yellow and purple. Although it is also said to be beautiful by many players, it is not as outstanding as the former in terms of color contrast and complementary effect.</p>
<h3 id="Emphasis-Color-Matching"><a href="#Emphasis-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="Emphasis Color Matching"></a>Emphasis Color Matching</h3><p>We mentioned that the three elements of color are hue (i.e., tone), lightness, and chroma (i.e., saturation). In addition to choosing different hue combinations, you can also adjust the lightness and chroma of colors to further emphasize the color relationship.</p>
<p>Especially when the lightness or saturation of a large area of color blocks is low, the color purity of a small area of modules is high, which will naturally present a very advanced sense of contrast. In a low-purity background, especially when black, white, and gray are used as the background color, a small part of high-purity color will be particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>For example, the group of single-character posters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in the picture below has a black and gray overall background. The most eye-catching thing in the picture is the iconic symbolic items of each character, all of which are high-purity red, which directly and implicitly expresses the positioning and even related background of the character, such as the red Buddhist beads on Tsuchimikado’s wrist, the blindfold taken off by Viper Ning, and the red umbrella behind Kurumi. The art form fully reflects the implicitness of oriental narrative, creating a sense of mystery, and the visual performance is also very beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Color Matching"></a>3. The Role of Color Matching</h2><p>In addition to the intuitive visual performance that can be seen at a glance, color also has a strong psychological suggestion effect. In game design, it is also common to adjust colors to shape the appearance.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality"><a href="#Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality"></a>Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality</h3><p>By adjusting the hue combination, lightness, and chroma, objects with the same shape can present different effects. Generally speaking, the greater the color change, or the richer the level of change, the final expression of the appearance is also very different. This difference can be cleverly transformed into “rules” of different qualities in game design.</p>
<p>For example, the four pictures below are four costumes of the female character Justina Gu in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. From left to right, the quality and value in the game increase. We can see that in terms of overall color matching, these four sets of clothes are generally relatively close, all of which are white with a reddish-brown color scheme. The default skin on the far left uses red with light brown. The color change is small and soft, and the contrast is not very strong. The expressiveness is also the weakest, corresponding to the initial quality skin in the game that can be obtained for free. Compared with the first set, the second set has no difference in shape design. The only change is that the color of the neckline and skirt is changed to jujube red, and the contrast is stronger, and the quality is also improved by one level. In addition to the more complicated shape design, the combination of white, water red and golden brown in the third set also enhances the sense of color layering. The last set is a very popular Dragon Gate - Apsaras (龙门·飞天) collaboration skin. On the whole, its background color is also white, but the bright red streamer + full body gold embellishment gives this set of costumes a sense of dignity and refinement.</p>
<p>If you further observe these four sets of clothes, the quality increases from left to right. The lightness of the red color scheme of the second to fourth sets also has different “standards”. The relatively low-quality ones mostly use colors with low lightness, and the highest-quality ones use bright red with high lightness and chroma, and the material presents a golden luster.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships"><a href="#Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Color Shapes Spatial Relationships"></a>Color Shapes Spatial Relationships</h3><p>In reality, the presentation of colors will be affected by factors such as light and distance. For example, if there is extra lighting when taking portraits, the skin will appear whiter and more translucent. For example, when trying on clothes in a mall, there are often small spotlights in front of the dressing mirror, which is also to make the color of the clothes appear the most eye-catching effect.</p>
<p>In the game, the designer will use this feature in reverse, using the light and dark changes of colors to shape the spatial relationship of the scene. For example, in the scene in the picture, the rockery, stones, and trees on the right have higher color purity and are visually closer; the houses and trees in the distance have lower purity but higher brightness, and the color contrast is blurred, giving people a feeling of being illuminated by sunlight in the distance.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is a preliminary exploration of the use of color in game design. In many scenes where users are usually contacted, whenever a player is asked “Why do you like this game?”, many people will say without thinking that they are attracted by the exquisite graphics or unique art style of the game. Vision is the first impression many players have of a game, and then gradually goes deep into gameplay, genre, social interaction and other factors. Color plays a vital role in the “first impression”. By making good use of color matching, the design philosophy of game art can be better conveyed, and the success of commercialization can also be better assisted.</p>
