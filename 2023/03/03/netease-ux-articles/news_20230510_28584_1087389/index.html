<p>For a game, player&#x2F;consumer churn is one of the most critical issues in its life cycle. Consumer churn refers to the situation where players who have a history of consumption in the game and whose cumulative consumption amount has reached a certain scale, but have not consumed for a recent period. Usually, this type of population overlaps with game churn users to a certain extent. When players churn from the game, they will naturally no longer have in-game consumption. In another case, players remain in the game, but churn in consumption. These players are often consumers that game manufacturers are very eager to retain, and are relatively easy to win back. The good news is that they are still interested in the game and are more likely to consume again than churned game players. The bad news is that the current supply in the game does not meet the needs of these players, resulting in player churn in consumption.</p>
<p>The reasons why players churn from the game are varied, such as dissatisfaction with the game’s character design, gameplay content, and other mechanisms, or the low input-output ratio during the cultivation process, or social and personal reasons. The recall of such players is often random. They may come back if the updated content of the game is attractive enough, or if they have looked around and there are no other games. Of course, we can also reach out through information channels to recall churned players, but in general, the effect of recall is limited without solving the fundamental problems. The purpose of analyzing and investigating such players is not only to win back these players, but also to mend the fold after the sheep are lost, find problems in time, and prevent other players from churning due to the same problems.</p>
<p>The reasons why players are still playing the game but no longer consuming are even more worthy of insight. We hope to hear their demands and understand how to keep them in the game.</p>
<h2 id="1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits"><a href="#1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits" class="headerlink" title="1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits"></a>1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits</h2><p>According to our research, different players have different consumption habits and game goals in the game, and their consumption needs will also vary. An overly simple or “taken for granted” supply structure obviously cannot satisfy the consumption experience of various players.</p>
<p>In terms of players’ consumption habits, the same game will include various consumption habits such as daily micro-transactions, large-scale transactions at key points, and on-demand transactions. The first two forms have a large player base and overlap. According to the research results, we classify the props mentioned by players in their self-reports. Overall, the consumption content in the game can be divided into basic consumables, scarce props, and decorative props (clothing, skins, etc.). Among them, basic consumables are often low-priced props that meet the basic clearance needs of the game. For example, props that obtain the number of game challenges or game duration, cheap props that are consumed a lot in basic enhancement or other basic game experiences; while scarce props are props that players need when they deeply experience the game and have high requirements for the attributes of characters or weapons. Generally, they are expensive and limited in supply.</p>
<p>The consumption habit of daily micro-transactions usually corresponds to basic consumables and a very small number of scarce props. For example, players purchase basic commodities such as game passes and weekly cards, and immediately purchase a small number of specific props or daily&#x2F;weekly gift packs containing the props according to immediate card draw and dress-up needs. The consumption of such players is basically used to meet the basic needs of the game. Without the stimulation of deep needs, the consumption amount will not change much. It is enough to retain and maintain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0f87a0e7-7ef0-401e-95b4-a0522e3756ea.png/size/"></p>
<p>The consumption habit of large-scale transactions at key points usually corresponds to the “stockpiling” of scarce props. For example, players specifically wait for activity nodes such as anniversaries, festivals, and new seasons to purchase the required props in large quantities at discounted prices, but they will not purchase them at the original price at ordinary times. Players who make large-scale transactions at key points are likely to exhibit “consumption churn” characteristics multiple times in their consumption life cycle. There are two reasons. First, players who make large-scale transactions at activity nodes have certain considerations for cost performance, and often use the “lowest discount” that has appeared in the game as a standard to measure whether they should buy; second, when the “stockpiling” is not used up, there will be no consumption of the same props at the next discount node.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the consumption frequency of players who make large-scale transactions at key points, one is to maintain a relatively stable node discount system and be cautious about breaking prices. Every price break will raise players’ psychological expectations for discounts and increase players’ dissatisfaction and wait-and-see attitude towards subsequent node discounts; the other is to pay attention to the activity cycle of each prop, and avoid two consecutive waves of activities focusing on the same prop, so as to reduce the situation where the consumption frequency decreases due to inventory. In addition, players who make large-scale transactions at key points are more concerned about the cost-effectiveness of consumption relative to the total consumption price. They adopt a pricing system of “increasing discounts with increasing consumption”, such as activities like “x% off for purchases over xx”.</p>
<p>Players who make on-demand transactions are usually “not short of money” and buy as they wish. For scarce props that can be bought daily, they do not wait for activities and do not consider cost-effectiveness much. They buy immediately when they need them. Such players have low price sensitivity. Under the condition of ensuring game balance and mechanics, there will be consumption if there is supply. After all, in most game designs, the scarcity of scarce props is extremely serious.</p>
<p>And according to the research results, it is speculated that the reasonable and small increase in daily supply will not affect the sales of large-scale transactions at key points. First, scarce props are always scarce resources under a reasonable supply system, and will not cause stockpiling at key points due to a small increase in daily supply. Second, the overlap between players who make on-demand transactions daily and players who wait for discount nodes is limited. The two systems do not have a high degree of competition and exclusivity.</p>
<h2 id="2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings"><a href="#2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings"></a>2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings</h2><p>In terms of consumption mechanisms, the two strategies currently commonly used in games are bundled sales and probability consumption. For example, bundled sales include combining different props and providing discounted gift packs and bundles; probability consumption includes various forms such as card draw, loot boxes, and probability enhancement. Player feedback on both mechanisms is very controversial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fa7e6e292-6fbe-4843-991a-17d90e363018.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Bundled-Sales"><a href="#Bundled-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Bundled Sales"></a>Bundled Sales</h3><p>Bundled sales include three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted purchase:</strong> When consumers purchase product A, they can purchase product B at a price lower than the market price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified price sale:</strong> Product A and product B are not priced separately, but are sold at a bundled unified price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified packaging sale:</strong> Product A and product B are sold in a unified package.</li>
</ul>
<p>The binding and mandatory nature of the three forms increase in turn. An important condition for unified price sales and unified packaging bundled sales is the complementarity between products. For example, the bundling of a set of fashion, or the bundling of various props required for a certain task. The complementarity between these products is strong enough, and bundled sales are a win-win situation for game revenue and player experience. However, it is counterproductive to adopt or bundle products that are not complementary or even have no complementarity.</p>
<p>In our research, players often give feedback that they are not satisfied with the content of the gift pack. Even for the same gift pack, the parts that different players are not satisfied with are also different. The gift pack content that this player thinks is redundant and a waste of money may be the reason why another player buys the gift pack. And this separation also shows that the bundling of this kind of gift pack has failed. Not only is there no complementarity between the different contents of the gift pack, but the target users are also too different. It is not recommended to adopt the strong binding method of unified price sale or unified packaging sale for this kind of combination. It is more suitable for the bundling method of discounted purchase, giving consumers the freedom to choose. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F1395ab05-de51-441f-8906-ece0369e9d43.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Probability-Consumption"><a href="#Probability-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="Probability Consumption"></a>Probability Consumption</h3><p>According to expected utility theory, players’ satisfaction with probability consumption is related to their personal risk utility function. In economics and finance, the risk preferences of market participants are divided into three categories: risk averse, risk neutral, and risk appetite, and it is believed that most people are risk-averse.</p>
<p>The utility function of risk averters is strictly concave, as shown in the figure below, U(E(W)) &gt; E(U(W)). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F371e25cb-e0bf-44fc-b4e6-69a3a8ba8227.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, when there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get 50 yuan</li>
<li>50% chance of getting 0 yuan, 50% chance of getting 100 yuan</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the average return is the same, risk averters will prefer “certain 50 yuan” rather than the risky option, that is, “the utility of 50 yuan” is greater than “the average of the utility of 0 yuan and the utility of 100 yuan”. The utility of the latter is only equivalent to “the income brought by certain CE (for example, 40 yuan)”.</p>
<p>According to the decision weight function of prospect theory, the decision weight of small probability events will be higher, which explains why people buy lottery tickets and are willing to draw prizes in the game for the small probability of winning the jackpot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe46d0d77-0948-41b5-b0ab-234ee927c81b.png/size/"></p>
<p>RP in the figure is the risk premium, that is, the difference between the determined income and the income from taking risks, which is the compensation required by investors for taking risks themselves. For risk averters, in the face of probability consumption such as lottery, probability enhancement, etc., in order to obtain the best or successful enhancement, the amount of probability consumption they are willing to pay will be less than their inner pricing of the target, and the difference is the risk premium.</p>
<p>Therefore, players will complain more during probability consumption: only when “the pricing of the drawing result” ≥ “the amount of probability consumption + risk premium” can it be possible to bring better psychological benefits than certain consumption. This also shows that the pricing of the guaranteed goods in the guarantee mechanism of probability consumption, or the expected price of consumers, needs to match “the amount of consumption + risk premium” in order to bring a satisfactory consumption experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players’ consumption habits are different, and they are accompanied by differences in consumption timing, types of consumed props, and consumption amount. Based on this, the supply quantity and rhythm of game props need to be reconsidered to further meet consumer demand. In terms of sales strategies, although bundled sales and probability consumption have become widely used methods in games, through consumer feedback and related theoretical research, from the perspective of optimizing consumer experience, the application of the two methods still has shortcomings. Bundled sales can be improved through simple and effective improvement methods, while the optimization method of probability consumption still needs further research and investigation.</p>
