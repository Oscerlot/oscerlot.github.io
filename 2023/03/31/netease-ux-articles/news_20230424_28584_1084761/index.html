<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In game research, we found a common phenomenon: when players experience new games or new gameplays, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play; on the other hand, the developers feel very confused. There is obviously a long introduction to the gameplay in the game, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Some veteran players also feel that new players are particularly “blind and unskilled” when they team up with new players to play dungeons. Even if the information is obvious, the novice will say that they did not see it.</p>
<p>So, how does this “blindness” of players come about? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”"><a href="#1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”" class="headerlink" title="1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?"></a>1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?</h2><p>When players are doing novice training, they need to go through the following steps to finally master the gameplay: I see the guide, I know I need to do this, I do it, I learn it. And if any of these steps are missing, it will cause the player to fail to learn.</p>
<p>In the initial research expectation, we believed that players getting stuck in the novice stage might be more difficult in “completing the guide”, that is, the task settings need to be adjusted. However, subsequent eye-tracking tests showed that more players were stuck in the first two steps, that is, the players did not see the guide at all, and this was not because the players were unwilling to read the novice guide. In the test, even if players were required not to skip the guide and to follow the guide prompts, they would still miss a lot of information.</p>
<p>Psychological research also confirms that this “invisibility” of players is not only common, but also innate, and is related to the selective attention mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See"><a href="#2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See"></a>2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See</h2><p>If the human brain is a TV set, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. Only the TV programs that finally appear on the screen can be noticed by us. Although in many cases people can consciously choose which programs to watch, in many cases, this choice is subconscious. Among them, those that do not require will effort and that people can naturally pay attention to are called involuntary attention. For example, it is difficult not to hear the ringing of a mobile phone in a quiet meeting room; a red flower in a green lawn will be more conspicuous than a green flower. The act of paying attention that requires will effort and needs to be actively made is called voluntary attention, such as reviewing homework before an exam, learning some useful but boring new knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>It is theorized that involuntary attention is a subconscious response and does not occupy psychological resources; but voluntary attention requires the player’s resources. Therefore, when receiving multiple external information, due to limited cognitive resources, players will selectively pay attention, that is, only see what they want to see and the most important information, while ignoring other information.</p>
<p>In the game, if the player cannot see the guide, it means that the current guide is likely to occupy too many resources, causing the player to spend too much effort to play the game. If you want the novice of the game to be noticed by the player, you need to manage the player’s attention and try to attract the player’s involuntary attention.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Kind-of-Information-is-Easier-to-be-Seen-Information-That-is-Different-and-Information-That-Matches-Your-Interests"><a href="#3-What-Kind-of-Information-is-Easier-to-be-Seen-Information-That-is-Different-and-Information-That-Matches-Your-Interests" class="headerlink" title="3. What Kind of Information is Easier to be Seen: Information That is Different and Information That Matches Your Interests"></a>3. What Kind of Information is Easier to be Seen: Information That is Different and Information That Matches Your Interests</h2><p>So, how to attract the player’s involuntary attention and let the player see it effortlessly? The reasons for attracting involuntary attention can be summarized into two categories:</p>
<h3 id="The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated"><a href="#The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated" class="headerlink" title="The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated."></a>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated.</h3><p>For example, it can be something unusual happening suddenly in the game, or it can be a significant difference from the surrounding game scene.</p>
<p>For example, when the game needs to guide the player to perform a dodge operation, there are generally prompts in the form of guide text or screen special effects. If the screen color or brightness changes significantly when the boss releases a skill, for example, a bright red circle appears in the skill range, the player will be able to pay attention to it at once without additional effort; but if there is only a change in the content of the guide text on the screen, the player is likely to not see it. Because the guide task prompts in the game are generally fixed on the left side of the screen, when the guide continues to appear in this state, in the player’s view, this area lacks change and lacks distinction from the surrounding scene, so it will be instinctively ignored.</p>
<h3 id="The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs"><a href="#The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs" class="headerlink" title="The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs."></a>The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs.</h3><p>In other words, the more the information matches the player’s interests, the more attention it can attract.</p>
<p>For example, when a new player encounters a new type of game for the first time, he will have some questions in his mind and expect a novice tutorial to guide his operation. At this time, the guide that pops up will be more easily noticed; and when a veteran player is playing the game, he has no expectations or related needs for guidance, so he often operates before consciousness and is more likely to not see the relevant guidance in the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design"><a href="#4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design" class="headerlink" title="4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?"></a>4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?</h2><p>How can the above characteristics related to attention guide the novice design of the game? Here are just a few interesting examples.</p>
<h3 id="Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance"><a href="#Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance" class="headerlink" title="Which form is better for novice guidance?"></a>Which form is better for novice guidance?</h3><p>Common novice guides are presented in text, pictures, and videos. According to our life experience, we will think that words are not as good as pictures, and pictures are not as good as videos. Some studies have also confirmed that paying attention to pictures can improve learning effects more than paying attention to text. But other studies have shown that it is not absolute that pictures are better than text, and the contrast effect needs to be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 1: Look at words when there are many pictures, and look at pictures when there are many words, highlighting the differences.</strong></p>
<p>When we observe real-world scenes, our attention is always attracted by the text embedded in these scenes, for example, text on signs or billboards. A study of travel photos found that people look more at the text in the pictures, and no matter what the text content is, they will pay attention to the text. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F2f60333d-14ad-4dbb-8e4c-40288171235d.png/size/" alt="A photo, as described in the article."></p>
<p>When we conducted eye-tracking tests on <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we also unexpectedly found that for the text and picture guides presented simultaneously in the game, the player’s gaze duration on the text was significantly longer than that on the pictures. In other words, people are always more likely to pay attention to information that is different. Whether the game chooses text guidance or picture guidance needs to be determined according to the characteristics of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F5812121f-25e2-4249-8f45-68aba68b7923.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Novice Guide Player Eye-tracking Heat Map</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But once the research scene is changed to a text-based webpage, the situation changes. Eye-tracking data shows that the pictures in the text pile are more eye-catching. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff1dc0888-a6a9-4ec4-abc4-a2db13f4a967.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Eye-tracking heat map for a webpage, the subject’s gaze is concentrated on the picture</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 2: Less is more, the more white space, the easier it is to be seen</strong></p>
<p>When there is too little white space between the logo and the main title, people will spend more time looking at the logo instead of the main title. And when the distance between the logo and the main title is increased, people’s attention to the title will increase. When two buttons are too close, they will also compete for attention. After changing to only one option, people’s visual attention increases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F7c2b20ea-0f3e-41c8-9ddb-e7ccf17e8b46.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>After the spacing is changed, the subject’s attention to the title increases</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In games, in order not to compete for attention, you can increase the white space between important prompts and buttons, and at the same time avoid dense presentation of important information in a paragraph of text.</p>
<h3 id="In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention"><a href="#In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention" class="headerlink" title="In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?"></a>In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?</h3><p>For the common problem that players cannot understand the guidance, developers easily want to “write more detailed guidance information” to help players understand. But the contrast effect has pointed out that dense text will cause players’ attention to be scattered, and to highlight the key points, more attention needs to be paid to white space. So, what else can be done?</p>
<p><strong>Multichannel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation</strong></p>
<p>Compared with players who only pay attention to vision or hearing, players who pay attention to both the visual and auditory channels process information faster and more accurately. Auditory information can attract the player’s visual attention to the direction pointed to by the auditory signal, and improve the efficiency of subsequent information processing.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, when players are near a Mongolian camp, they may hear singing, drumming, and playing the morin khuur; they may also hear the playing of the pipa, and players can follow the sound to find the storyteller, thus being led to new tasks. Foxes are another example. Their short, sharp calls manage the player’s attention early on, making it difficult for the player to miss the guidance and ultimately leading the player to the shrine. </p>

<h3 id="Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster"><a href="#Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster" class="headerlink" title="Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster"></a>Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster</h3><p><strong>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text, the better the learning</strong></p>
<p>The position of pictures and text will also affect people’s attention to learning materials. The closer the pictures and text, the longer the gaze duration, the more gaze times, and the better the memory of the knowledge points afterwards; and when the pictures and text are close, people’s gaze point switching between the pictures and text is more frequent. This means that the proximity effect affects people’s attention allocation, thereby improving the learning effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3f3acdd7-31ea-406b-b1a1-a8070e0e8b4f.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>“The formation principle of lightning” as learning material, the right picture is the picture-text proximity group, the learning effect is better</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points</strong></p>
<p>Designers always want to use visual cues to try to guide users’ browsing direction on a webpage, so are some visual cues more effective than others? Some studies have tried different forms such as hand-drawn arrows, character photos (looking at the table &amp; facing away from the table), line prompts, and adding border outlines. The final result shows that visual cues do affect users’ attention to the form, with hand-drawn arrows leading to the most user attention to the form. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa0a63665-6040-41a9-ade4-5425d86195e9.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>The player’s turning a blind eye is more related to the selective attention mechanism, and the characteristics of attention determine that people will only see what they want to see. Game design should pay attention to the player’s attention management, try to attract the player’s involuntary attention, rather than forcing indoctrination. For example, you can consider making the information more different and making the information more in line with the player’s current interests. Specifically in the design, the contrast effect, proximity effect, multichannel presentation, line guidance, etc. can all be used as design guidelines.</p>
