<p>For sighted people, even with the golden key of accessibility services, after actual operation, it is found that there are quite a few hurdles to overcome. It is even more difficult to imagine how blind people can happily play mobile games with us. Everyone jokes that poverty limits their imagination, but after seeing a set of real data, I found that my imagination is actually limited by prejudice.</p>
<p>According to the “Basic Situation Report of Visually Impaired Internet Users in China” released by the Secretariat of the China Information Accessibility Product Alliance (CAPA), there are 13 million visually impaired people in China (as of 2016), of which 91% are blind people of level one and two (as shown in the figure below). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F22cb6972-9b43-410a-adbf-609c6b3993ea.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Disability Level Ratio of 13 Million Visually Impaired People</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Among the visually impaired users surveyed, 92% use smartphones, of which 22% have used Internet software such as Didi, Kuaidi, and Uber to hail taxis, 33% have installed 11-20 applications on their mobile phones, and 83% can completely rely on screen reading functions when operating mobile phones and computers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F8d515964-5de7-40eb-957c-3b8ed52300d8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>What Visually Impaired People Usually Do Online on Their Mobile Phones</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the “2021 China Digital Inclusion User Survey Report” released in 2021, it can be seen that the completely blind group has a very high usage and dependence on smart products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe9c44f66-e0c0-4570-b993-a16ee3033a49.png/size/"></p>
<p>Combining the above two reports, we can see that 99% of completely blind people will use smartphones, and 54% of visually impaired people (91% of whom are blind) will use mobile phones to play games. So, facing the huge gaming needs of the visually impaired group, how to better solve the accessibility settings in the game has become one of the missions of game practitioners.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the gaming experience of the completely blind group, and introduce existing excellent game cases and analyze the methodology in three aspects: the auditory experience of the blind group, the guide design suitable for the blind group, and the game types suitable for the blind group.</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games"><a href="#1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?"></a>1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?</h2><h3 id="Sound-Design"><a href="#Sound-Design" class="headerlink" title="Sound Design"></a>Sound Design</h3><p>Sound is a very important part for blind players. We can get some clues from the existing few games specially designed for the blind: take the <em>Street Fighter</em> series as an example - every action, move, windup, and recovery will activate corresponding unique sounds.</p>
<p>First, the sounds are sorted and adjusted in a more detailed order of priority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F25d474f5-ad4a-4587-a532-b82bd3e84fc2.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Comparison of Different Sounds Visualized in the Game</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Games are not like movies. Movies will mix the sounds according to the process of the film during sound production, so that all sounds maintain the correct proportion. However, the game is completely dynamic, and all actions will change according to the player’s state. If the designer just puts the sound into the game, it must be a disaster.</p>
<p>Here, take FPS games as an example. The real situation is this: when the player shoots, he can hardly hear other sounds; but when the player’s walkie-talkie starts to speak, other sounds will become smaller to ensure that the player can hear his task goals clearly; and when an explosion occurs, other sounds will be covered up… All these arrangements can ensure the player’s pleasure in playing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F5eeb0bc5-4ae3-48eb-9e37-72a369340d83.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, when designing games for blind players, designers need to give priority to different sounds through early design, so that certain sounds “give way” to other sounds when they come out.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Emotional-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Sound Feedback"></a>Emotional Sound Feedback</h3><p>For example, in parkour games, the sense of pleasure is the power that constantly supports players to continue playing. At least on the sound level, it is necessary to extend the player’s excitement and freshness, and provide certain positive feedback.</p>
<p>Then a more classic design scheme is to judge the player’s current survival state and survival time through interactive music, and the music is switched and changed in real time to match the current game progress in terms of emotion; at the same time, the sound of a large number of coins or points picked up in the game becomes the pitch that matches the tonality of the background music - that is, the random pitch within the range of the scale where the music is currently located. In this way, when the player runs continuously and eats coins, he will play a melody line that belongs only to the player and does not conflict with the background music; for example, when you eat three coins in a row and trigger three notes, you will be eager to hear the appearance of the next note, and hope that this note will be “developed” and “resolved”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fed1bb0b0-fd54-4c02-8429-e4559df84557.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p>This is completely in line with human psychology, and it also stimulates the player’s motivation to continue playing.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound feedback during some basic system interface operations needs to rely on the strong logic and rationality of the UI at all levels to support it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F066908c4-d22b-4f39-bd28-1d32551ca370.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Because it is necessary to use sound to establish the UI operation interface, it is more necessary to have a good operation flow. Out of consideration for the blind group, it is also very important to use sound to awaken the user’s curiosity in the functional interface. Currently, the types of sounds commonly used in functional interface operations are: music, sound effects, natural sounds, human voices, and so on. Another point is whether the arrangement of elements in the interface is upward, downward, leftward, or rightward. The position in the interface exists as an interesting variable, and is generally used to express the hierarchical structure between various information elements, and the information transmission and reading order on the screen (accessibility information reading function) between them, which can help developers sort the elements in turn. The more reasonable the design of the interface and process, the more it can empower the gaming experience of the blind group.</p>
<p>In addition, excellent plot can enhance the sense of substitution of the blind group, thereby activating the picture in the heart of the blind group.</p>
<p>Sound can create atmosphere and emotion. Through different sound styles and music, different game scenes and emotions can be created, allowing completely blind players to feel the theme, style, story and other elements of the game. </p>

<h3 id="Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Rich Gesture Sound Feedback"></a>Rich Gesture Sound Feedback</h3><p>In blind games, gesture commands are a commonly used interaction method, which can allow blind users to control the game through the touch screen, improving the operability and ease of use of the game. To make gesture commands play a better role in blind games, improvements can be made in the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design simple, easy-to-remember and intuitive gesture commands, avoiding commands that are too complex or easy to confuse.</li>
<li>Provide clear, definite and timely sound feedback so that the blind group knows which command they have executed and what effect it has produced.</li>
<li>Consider the different degrees of visual impairment of users and the adaptation problems of different types of devices, and provide multiple choices or custom options.</li>
<li>Conduct sufficient and continuous user testing and evaluation, and optimize and improve according to user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the built-in accessibility service of the iPhone binds rich gesture commands with unique sound feedback to form memory points, so as to better help the blind group to operate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F391368a4-bc68-4c7f-97b8-71b98b63abc8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without exquisite visual animation, and regardless of the design style of flatness and three-dimensionality, the focus of interaction falls on physical gestures. For example, the interactive operations performed by normal people on mobile phones, such as “single click to enter”, “long press and drag”, “slide to switch screens”, etc., are all redefined in the accessibility assistance mode. Blind people no longer need to rely on the physical buttons of the mobile phone to use various program services more deeply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fbdab9f6b-4fff-4eda-8d00-f169d837f9b8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Adding more gesture operations and corresponding sound feedback in the game can help the blind group deepen their memory of operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Good-Guidance"><a href="#2-Good-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Good Guidance"></a>2. Good Guidance</h2><p>In blind games, the role of good guidance is to help players familiarize themselves with the rules, goals, operations and environment of the game, improve players’ participation and satisfaction, and reduce frustration and abandonment.</p>
<h3 id="Guidance"><a href="#Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Guidance"></a>Guidance</h3><p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> provides an enhanced listening mode, which enhances the search for high-priority targets and plays corresponding prompt sounds to remind players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F2578656d-5f6d-491f-8176-c6f93581d72e.png/size/"></p>

<p>In addition, the way to receive information should also be informed to the blind group in advance: sound can provide navigation and feedback. Through different sound effects and voice prompts, it can help completely blind players understand the game interface, operation methods, target locations, obstacles and other information, as well as the results of their actions and state changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fadd3ebdb-03e1-4437-9e01-adb26a32ace0.png/size/"></p>

<p>Instructions for wearing headphones are also very important, because the blind group will distinguish their operations and the situation they are in according to surround stereo or left and right channels. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F4470464f-c0bf-44b9-abdf-112f183cc143.png/size/"></p>

<p>Since blind games need to be supplemented by narration or prompt sounds for conventional operations, it is necessary to pay attention to the problem of “speech speed”. People with normal vision usually quickly obtain content and react by receiving visual information, but as a blind group that mainly obtains content through hearing, it is necessary to plan the “functional sound” in the game in advance and open the permission or function to adjust the speed of these sounds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fc0154312-cda2-434c-b9b2-7e0923e4f183.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Positioning"><a href="#Positioning" class="headerlink" title="Positioning"></a>Positioning</h3><p>In blind games, the sound design of positioning is very important, because it can help blind players perceive space and direction, and improve the playability and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Referenceable solutions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>At different positions, when the distance from the other party increases or decreases, frequency conversion processing is performed on the footsteps.</li>
<li>The methodology of echolocation is to use the characteristics of sound wave reflection and attenuation in space to simulate the position of the environment and the enemy. It needs to consider how to design sound sources of different types and intensities, and how to deal with echo effects and reverberation effects; it also needs to consider how to balance the relationship between sound and picture, avoiding audiovisual inconsistency or being too abstract.</li>
<li>Encode visual information into sound signals, so that the blind can perceive images through sound. Its core principle is to scan the image from left to right, map the horizontal direction to the time axis of the sound, map the vertical direction to the pitch of the sound, and map the brightness to the loudness of the sound. This forms an image-to-sound mapping, allowing the blind to hear the shape, size, color, position and other information of objects in the scene through headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: After the launch of <em>Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, in addition to the picture, some information of the character can also be judged by the change of sound alone. In the SFC version, with the help of dual-channel stereo output, if you control the character to walk from left to right, the footsteps of the character will also change accordingly, so that blind players can grasp the progress of the game through the change of sound.</p>
<p>In addition, the reading of maps and coordinates, and the detailed consideration of game special effects and dubbing are all important details from accessibility to improving the experience of the blind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fbd17cdba-39a2-402f-aadc-d58f6a145e11.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the game <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, echolocation technology is used. Players can scan new spaces to determine whether there are targets that need to be fought or items that need to be collected in the space. </p>

<p>When blind players hear different prompt sounds, they can also use the voice prompt dictionary to find the situation corresponding to the familiar prompt sound, so as to enhance memory and improve the response to the sound, and obtain a smoother game experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F82f78ad4-6671-46d9-bc4b-34fdae87381c.png/size/"></p>

<p>For positioning, fault tolerance is required, because although blind people have the assistance of sound and feedback when playing games, they still need corresponding positioning solutions. </p>

<p>Common ones include replacing “precise selection” with “close to the sound source” and other prompt guides that are more in line with the actual operation of the blind. </p>

Games and Gameplay Suitable for the Blind</h2><p>For the types and gameplay of games that the blind group likes to play, we believe that the current blind game product types on the market mainly include fighting games, such as <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em>, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fde8aca9b-5fa4-43d6-93b5-43f5466970d4.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Fighting games are a very friendly game type for the blind group, because the game scene is relatively fixed and simple, and the movement range of the characters is also relatively simple. Secondly, these games make extensive use of audio to prompt different actions in the game, allowing the blind group to clearly understand the situation of the game. In the game <em>Street Fighter</em>, many blind players can reach high ranks. </p>

<p>In addition, there are casual games, card games, etc. In addition, there are “audio games” dominated by sound, which is a game type specially designed for the completely blind group. Like the game types mentioned above, they have quite excellent and complete sound effects and game dubbing.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Although so far, the number of games for the blind and other disabled people is still very small, and many of them are small games with relatively simple functions, from the color change system for color-blind players in the Japanese national mobile game <em>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</em> in the early years, to the NS version of <em>1-2-Switch</em> where blind players can play with normal people through the HD vibration function of the controller, and games with excellent sound effects such as the <em>Street Fighter</em> series, we have also seen more and more game developers making efforts in this area. As a blind player interviewed said:</p>
<p>“If you can play games like normal people, you can communicate with other people like normal people. I think games are a tool for communication. After all, it’s better to enjoy together than to enjoy alone.”</p>
