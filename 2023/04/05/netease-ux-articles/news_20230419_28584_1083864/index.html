<p>Since Microsoft pioneered the achievement system in the early 20th century, game achievement systems have been an important part of the gaming community, but there have also been many questions. Game achievement systems were born as a tool to promote player engagement, but they have turned many players into pure “achievement hunters”. Do players really need achievement systems? From the perspective of motivation in psychology, perhaps we can get some different thoughts and inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="1-Do-players-really-need-trophies"><a href="#1-Do-players-really-need-trophies" class="headerlink" title="1. Do players really need trophies?"></a>1. Do players really need trophies?</h2><p>Two months ago, Fredrik Thylander, lead game designer at Ubisoft Massive, said this on Twitter: “Unpopular opinion: achievements&#x2F;trophies have been bad for gaming. It narrows games, it disrupts and diverts attention, it eats resources that could have made the game better.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F10e03acd-567a-44e2-a50a-e18fd1d21c76.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Fredrik Thylander’s tweet on Twitter received attention from more than 200,000 players</em></p>
<p>Thylander’s speech sparked a lot of discussion among players, with both supporters and opponents. Supporters believe that achievements make players play games only for achievements. Many players don’t even enjoy the game well. They just open the guide and get one platinum trophy or achievement point after another. Some opponents believe that the existence of the game achievement system provides them with a goal to play the game, otherwise they may never challenge those high-difficulty or racing-type gameplays.</p>
<p>The good and bad of the achievement system is certainly not a monistic point of view. At least for many game developers and platforms, the existence of the achievement system has become an inseparable part. It can effectively extend the life of the game, guide players to experience the complete game design content, and provide players with a simple and direct game goal and positive feedback. But for players, the achievement system is not an insignificant prompt that pops up at the bottom of the game interface. As an external incentive mechanism, it profoundly affects the player’s motivation for the game. More and more players are beginning to question: Do we really need achievements?</p>
<h2 id="2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect"><a href="#2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect"></a>2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect</h2><p>The birth of the achievement system can be traced back to the 1980s Activision game <em>Chopper Command</em>, whose gameplay is very common flight shooting. But what’s more special is that if the player’s game score exceeds 10,000 points, the player can take a photo or video and exchange it for a special physical game badge from Activision. However, physical achievements are still a bit cumbersome, and soon achievements began to shift to the form of “electronic certificates”. The 1990 puzzle game <em>E-Motion</em> designed 5 “achievements” in the game. Players can get game points by completing all levels, which is the prototype of today’s achievement system.</p>
<p>The first cross-game achievement system was born in 2005, when Microsoft first launched the Gamerscore system on Xbox 360. Players can earn achievement points by completing game achievements on the platform, and points from different games can be accumulated. Subsequently, in 2008, Sony changed the score to a more intuitive trophy system. One achievement corresponds to one trophy. Players can unlock the platinum trophy as long as they obtain all achievements. Compared with points, trophies can more directly represent the player’s game completion and have become one of the most representative features on the PS platform. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe1823c92-eb25-4681-8c97-78235b590e88.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Trophy levels on PS: The player’s level is determined according to the quality and number of trophies obtained by the player)</em></p>
<p>Of course, players who play console games all year round also know that Nintendo games do not have an achievement system. In this regard, then-Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto said: “I don’t like to use external factors to attract people to invest time in games. I hope players play games just because they enjoy the game.”</p>
<p>The game concepts of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo correspond to the external motivation and internal motivation of players to play games.</p>
<p><em>Extrinsic motivation</em> means that a person chooses to participate in an activity not because they like it very much, or because it can make you feel satisfied, but because this activity can bring some kind of reward or avoid some kind of punishment; <em>Intrinsic motivation</em> is directly related to the activity itself. Because doing something can stimulate people’s interest and make people happy, the activity itself is the goal pursued by the actor.</p>
<p>In recent years, many designers or players have questioned the value of the achievement system, largely because: as an external motivation provided by the manufacturer, game trophies can easily form an <em>overjustification effect</em>, reducing the player’s internal motivation.</p>
<p>The research on the overjustification effect began in the 1970s. In 1971, Edward Deci, a psychology professor at the University of Rochester, invited two groups of college students to complete intelligence tests. Experimental group subjects could get $1 reward for each problem solved, while control group subjects had no reward. Then observe whether the two groups of subjects will continue to solve problems after the test is over. The results found that although the experimental group worked very hard to solve problems, they obviously lost interest in solving problems after the test was over; while the control group would continue to solve problems after the test was over.</p>
<p>The overjustification effect represents the damage of external motivation to internal motivation. If too many external rewards are used to motivate individuals to do something they are willing to do, it will reduce their internal motivation. Because this will make this individual think that his motivation for behavior comes from the outside, and once the external motivation is lost, the individual will not continue to engage in this behavior.</p>
<p>In 2010, a speech at the Global Game Developers Conference (GDC), “Achievements Considered Harmful?”, proposed the harmful impact of the achievement system on players from this perspective. Achievements themselves exist as external incentives for the game, but with the achievement system, the game motivation of many players will gradually shift to unlocking trophies in the game. Players may gradually lose their love for the game on the way to unlocking trophies, and become pure “achievement hunters” or “platinum hunters”.</p>
<p>Platinum trophies provide a goal for many players, but they also limit many players to just getting trophies and showing them off on social media.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements"><a href="#3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements" class="headerlink" title="3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?"></a>3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?</h2><p>Since external motivation will damage the internal motivation of the game, should we completely abandon the achievement system?</p>
<p>In the study of the motivation system, Deci further tested the impact of “verbal rewards” on task motivation, and found that, compared with those without feedback, students who were told “you did a good job” showed an increase in intrinsic motivation on subsequent tasks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the overjustification effect is not inevitable. With more and more research, scholars have given clearer results on the relationship between external motivation and internal motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Non-contingent external rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can only be obtained when the activity results reach a certain level) cause less damage to intrinsic motivation and produce more promotion than those <em>contingent rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can be obtained as long as the activity is carried out);</p>
<p>  Non-contingent external rewards and contingent rewards correspond to two different types of achievements: assessment achievements and contingent achievements. <em>Assessment achievement</em> means that players will only be given specific rewards if they achieve a certain standard, such as our more common high-difficulty clearance achievements or level ratings. <em>Contingent achievement</em> is a reward that players will inevitably be given as long as they complete a certain event or process. Process rewards mostly belong to this.</p>
<p>  Because of their low acquisition difficulty, contingent achievements are difficult to form effective positive feedback on player behavior. At the same time, in recent years, the overall game difficulty has become more friendly, and necessary achievements are easily overused, which instead easily attracts players to focus on trophies rather than the game itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Unexpected rewards</em> have a greater positive effect on intrinsic motivation than <em>expected rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  This division actually involves the design problem of the achievement system itself - should we hide the achievements or completely display them to the player. Aside from achievements hidden to avoid spoilers, most game achievements are still mainly explicit. Explicit achievements provide players with a relatively clear goal and a preliminary understanding of the game. Players are also more likely to simply plan their game path through game achievements. For example, in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, in addition to the conventional high-difficulty clearance achievements, some fancy clearance achievements will also be explicitly shown to players - the creator implies that players can choose to continuously increase the difficulty level of the game, or choose to challenge some strange clearance methods.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F37f49a7f-c1ed-4df7-b857-0e455eddfe2c.png/size/"></p>
<pre><code>*(Fancy clearance achievements in the rogue-like card game &quot;Slay the Spire&quot;)*

Compared with explicit achievements, hidden achievements appear less frequently in games, but they have a better promoting effect on players&#39; internal motivation. Not letting players know the specific trophy content in advance, and giving players rewards when players accidentally trigger or curiously try some new content, can stimulate players&#39; game fun more than directly telling players the achievement content. Because this kind of unexpected feedback is based on the player&#39;s own playing motivation, it will also encourage players to make more attempts and &quot;unorthodox&quot; gameplay.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Intangible external rewards</em> produce more promotion and less weakening than <em>tangible rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  It is not appropriate to use intangible and tangible descriptions to evaluate the achievement system. After all, platinum trophies are not really “platinum”. For the achievement system, tangible&#x2F;intangible actually lies in whether the achievement system carries other external values in addition to game incentives and self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>  For example, for many players, full achievements have always had a strong social significance.</p>
<p>  From the perspective of the game platform, the achievement system generally exists as part of the community system. You can clearly see the number of platinum trophies of this player in the PS personal profile; there is also a special “achievement showcase” on Steam for players to display their achievements. Single-player games themselves naturally lack interaction between players. For the core players of the platform, they always need something to show their “noble status”. This is also why single-player games pay more attention to the achievement system than online games. After all, online games have levels, combat power, and appearance, and single-player players want to prove that they are superior, and there is almost no other way but trophies.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F9bca9588-bc41-4314-9384-e1c8e8e2cf60.jpg/size/"></p>
<pre><code>In addition, when the platinum trophy has become a matter of &quot;competitiveness&quot;, the nature of the matter will change differently.

There is a website called Astats, which will count the game achievements of the Steam platform in real time, as well as the number of achievements completed by players, and give rankings, providing an off-game PVP standard for steam achievement hunters. What kind of demand there is, there is what kind of product. There are many achievement-hunting games on Steam, represented by *Achievement Hunter*. Players basically only need to do nothing and hang up for two hours to unlock more than a thousand achievements in the game. These &quot;games&quot; themselves only serve the external value of achievements, and players no longer have any internal motivation for the game itself.

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Returning to our opening question, do players really need achievements? We might as well use a sentence from Hegel to answer this question:</p>
<p>“What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.”</p>
<p>The gamerscore system, introduced in 2005, was intended to help boost activity among players and to get them to talk to each other more about the games.  Two years later, Xbox 360 product manager Aaron Greenberg said, “And we found out that a lot of people were playing Xbox games a lot because we offered points and the other platforms didn’t.”</p>
<p>At least for most players now, the achievement system is still an inseparable part of the game itself. At the end of last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em> landed on Steam, and many negative reviews came from the fact that the game did not have an achievement system.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a big deal to have no achievements. Nintendo has always maintained an indifferent attitude towards achievements. They can add 999 “Korok Seeds” in Zelda. Whether players choose to collect them and how much they collect depends entirely on personal wishes. Therefore, for players, how to design achievements is far more important than whether there are achievements.</p>
<p>As an external motivation to motivate players, the achievement system itself has the risk of overjustification effect. However, adding moderate assessment achievements and hidden achievements to the game can not only avoid the overjustification effect, but also further stimulate the player’s internal motivation. Although it is difficult for us to avoid the existence of achievement PVP, most platforms now provide options to hide achievements or trophies. When we want to truly experience the game, we may also choose to turn on the options.</p>
