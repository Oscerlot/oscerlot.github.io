<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the German Game Market"></a>1. Overview of the German Game Market</h2><p>Germany is located in central Europe. It is the engine of Europe and also the largest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Data shows that Germany’s total GDP in 2022 was 27.38 trillion.</p>
<p>After setting a revenue record in 2020, the German game market also achieved explosive growth in 2021, with a total revenue (including hardware, games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases) of approximately 9.76 billion euros. Compared with 2012, it has more than tripled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F0577e133-b993-4283-8938-df10249a1715.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>As of 2021, German game market revenue (published on February 23, 2023)</em></p>
<p>The growing demand of German players for game-related hardware (especially consoles) is considered to be an important driving force for the booming German game market. Although some game consoles were in short supply due to the impact of the epidemic on the supply chain and logistics, the overall revenue of consoles also resisted the pressure and increased by 23%, reaching 808 million euros. Revenue from in-app purchases has also increased. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fe20c6691-9d75-4f14-8349-8446df2ae533.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>German hardware revenue achieved huge growth in 2021</em></p>
<p>It is worth noting that, in addition to areas strongly related to games, such as game copies and hardware, which have performed well, the market for game furniture and game accessories in Germany is also gradually taking the stage. According to a survey by the German Game Industry Association, nearly millions of players have purchased game-related furniture, and more than 11 million players plan to purchase game-related furniture, including gaming chairs, computer stands, controller stands, lamps, etc. Therefore, many well-known furniture manufacturers in Germany have also launched their game series furniture in order to occupy this huge market early. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F556d943f-5330-4021-9f2d-38fdfacceaca.png/size/"></p>
<p>From a platform perspective, according to statistics from the German Game Association, as of 2022, there are 23.5 million mobile game players in Germany. In addition, there are 10.7 million users who use tablets to play games. The number of mobile game users accounts for a relatively high proportion.</p>
<p>The demand of German players for consoles (such as Switch, PlayStation, Xbox) is also basically increasing year by year. It may be that the impact of the epidemic is getting smaller and smaller, and most Germans are no longer locked down at home, so the number of PC players has decreased slightly in comparison. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff8b65aab-f810-4ca3-9c34-19207216004c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base"><a href="#2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base" class="headerlink" title="2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base"></a>2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base</h2><p>According to the latest population statistics in 2022, Germany has a total population of 82.196 million. Its game penetration rate is nearly 60%, which means that 6 out of every 10 people have gaming experience, and the number of game players is approaching 50 million.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quality of German game users is also very high. Most German players believe that payment is a guarantee of game quality, and their willingness to pay is second only to the United States. Nearly 70% of players are willing to pay for games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F68d60fbd-52ef-4ecd-8411-5b87fafeadf5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Note: The data comes from a questionnaire survey conducted by Gamma Data (CNG) on mobile game user groups in the United States&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;France&#x2F;United Kingdom.)</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, according to data from the German Federal Statistical Office, except for the elderly group over 75 years old, the largest age group in Germany is 55-59 years old, accounting for 8.2% of the total population. The average age of the German population has reached 47 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F8f28d6d7-6457-40df-900c-d6057eef668c.png/size/"></p>
<p>The serious aging of the population has also increased the average age of game players. According to survey data from market research company GfK: The proportion of middle-aged and elderly players in Germany aged 50-59 reached 18%, which is the highest proportion of age groups. Many players in the 1980s and 1990s have maintained their hobby of playing video games to this day. At the same time, the average age of German game players is also increasing year by year: in 2020, the average age of players was 37.4 years old, and in 2021, it has reached 37.6 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa29b2c20-9ae4-44a6-aab9-949502d0ba86.png/size/"></p>
<p>Germany has a general trend of an aging society, so German residents are rigorous, relatively conservative, pay attention to order, and are less social. Nearly 80% of players will learn about product user reviews, overall ratings, and descriptions before downloading the game. At the same time, the relatively conservative characteristics are also subtly affecting the aesthetics of Germans. For example, Germans tend to wear darker clothes, and like to wear practical clothes such as jackets. At the same time, they are also conservative in the aesthetic style of games, and do not like overly chaotic and bright colors.</p>
<p>For example, in the evaluation of the appearance of female characters in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some German players gave positive comments because some female characters did not wear high heels, which is very practical in actual combat.</p>
<p>Therefore, grasping the above characteristics of German players can help game manufacturers to be more successful when going overseas to Germany. At the same time, these characteristics are also reflected in German players’ preferences for games.</p>
<h2 id="3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices"><a href="#3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices" class="headerlink" title="3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices"></a>3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices</h2><p>Rigorous and conservative Germans maintain their consistent habits in the choice of game genres: strategy games are especially popular. Surveys show that the 5 most popular game categories in Germany in 2022 are: strategy, action, action-adventure, adventure, and simulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc8d90a2d-2444-4364-8533-e9f50e0dbbb6.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to data from Data.ai, among the games with the most downloads by German players, strategy games + match-3 games account for 70% of the list. The Top 10 of the list are basically casual puzzle games, which is also in line with the needs of middle-aged and elderly players for game choices: they don’t need to spend too much time, the gameplay is not particularly intense, and they can sit quietly on the sofa and use their brains. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fb235ef91-07af-453f-b561-e4318c0fc947.png/size/"></p>
<p>The loyalty of the German mobile game market is very high, which is not only reflected in the choice of games: <em>Coin Master</em>, which ranks first in mobile game revenue, was released 13 years ago, but it still occupies the top few positions in the German game list for many years. Classic match-3 games like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> have also been released for 9 years. Most of the games on the list are old games that have been released for more than two years. It can be seen that Germans are very dedicated to their favorite games.</p>
<p>In addition, their choice of game genres is also very single, fixed on strategy, elimination, and simulation management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3a93b057-1e16-4bd9-bf7e-4a50e88642e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The rankings of PC and console games are very different from those of mobile games. In addition to the simulation management games that German players love, most of the PC games on the list are relatively hardcore. <em>EA Sports FIFA 22</em>, which was just released by EA, once again topped the sales chart, which shows the German players’ love for football. It is followed by the open-world game <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched by Rockstar. The third place is the racing game <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. The fourth place is <em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, and the fifth place is <em>Minecraft</em>. Most of the games on the list can meet the needs of teaming up or have pvp modes, which can meet some competitive needs of hardcore PC players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc765c7f5-35c6-4ef7-a2d0-eb93d8897cad.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The game culture in Germany is very mature, and many players have been exposed to games since childhood. In addition, German players have a high willingness to pay. Due to the aging of the population, the average age of players has increased, which is also the reason why German players have relatively strong payment capabilities. As the engine of the European economy, Germany also has one of the largest game markets in Europe, with almost 60% of Germans having gaming experience.</p>
<p>Unlike Chinese players, console games still maintain a high status in Germany, but the development of mobile games has surpassed traditional games, and more than 70% of players play mobile games.</p>
<p>In addition, German players have obvious “nostalgic” characteristics. Most of the various rankings are old games that have been online for more than 2 years, and the genres are relatively single. This also brings a lot of pressure to some new products that want to enter the German market. But on the other hand, when you want to enter the German market, the selection of products is more accurate. Once a new product is accepted by players, it is easier to stabilize and settle down.</p>
