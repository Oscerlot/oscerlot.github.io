<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the spread and rise of video games in modern society, the term “game community” related to video games has gradually entered the public eye. In today’s increasingly globalized world, the overseas expansion of games has become an indispensable part of the development of the game industry. Therefore, investigating the “game communities” of players in target regions, and subsequently formulating appropriate strategies for game distribution and subsequent operations, has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>The “game community” is a subset of the concept of “virtual community”. “Virtual community” was first proposed by Howard Rheingold, meaning “a group of people who primarily communicate with each other through computer networks, who have a certain degree of shared cognition, share knowledge and information, and care for each other to a large extent as friends, thus forming a group”. Unlike the traditional concept of community, “virtual community” originates from computers, is built in the virtual world, and develops on the Internet. The “game community” derived from the concept of “virtual community” refers to a group that spontaneously gathers on the Internet around the common interest of games.</p>
<p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> Japanese community in this article is a group of Japanese players who have spontaneously gathered around the game. Due to the diversity of network platforms, game communities also have various forms of expression. In Japan, mainstream game communities include Twitter, 5channel (also known as 2channel, hereinafter referred to as 5ch), Lobi, and so on. Because each platform has its own characteristics and functions, the game communities formed by players will also show different characteristics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb1caa3e1-54a1-4d0a-baa9-a51a0a85930d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan"><a href="#1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="1. User Characteristics of 5chan"></a>1. User Characteristics of 5chan</h2><p>When accessing the Japanese Internet, especially cultural and community activities, 5chan and its user base are impossible to ignore. 5chan, formerly known as “2channel” (2ch.net, hereinafter referred to as 2ch), was founded by Hiroyuki Nishimura in 1999 and is Japan’s largest anonymous forum (now no longer completely anonymous). Its initial purpose was to serve as an alternative website to “Amezou Bulletin Board”. Amezou Bulletin Board was a comprehensive forum that aggregated multiple posts, and adopted the then-epoch-making “thread float type bulletin board” format (posts that received replies would be pushed to the top of the thread, while posts that did not receive replies would sink relatively, and posts with no response at all would sink to the bottom).</p>
<p>Later, Amezou Bulletin Board was closed in 2000 due to lack of functionality, server instability, and other reasons, and a large number of users poured into 2ch. In 2014, the actual management authority of 2ch (2ch.net) was transferred to James Arthur Watkins, Hiroyuki Nishimura was dismissed, and “2channel” (2ch.sc) was established. In 2017, “2channel” owned by James Arthur Watkins was renamed “5channel” (5ch.net).</p>
<p>5chan, which was opened in 1999, absorbed the habits of previous forums in terms of users, content, and forum terminology. The communication method of avoiding collusion among users and using unique jargon (later called 2ch terminology) was strongly influenced by electronic forums in the dawn of the Internet, namely the “dark web”.</p>
<p>In addition to the particularity of communication, 5chan also contains many opinions and information that cannot be seen in newspapers, television, or well-known media, and shows a critical attitude towards specific media such as <em>Asahi Shimbun</em>. Many people believe that “if I have to say, there is more negative information on 2ch. Because it is a vent for the negative personality of human beings, it is reasonable to degenerate into a garbage dump”.</p>
<p>In Tomohisa Hirai’s “Investigation of 2ch Communication: Discussion on the Internet and its Public Opinion Formation”, he summarizes the users of 2ch into the following 3 characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints"><a href="#Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints"></a>Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints</h3><p>Compared with face-to-face communication, Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) gives communicators (the actors themselves) more room for deliberation and choice. In face-to-face communication, communicators can express themselves through speech, body movements, clothing, etc., but it is difficult to manipulate self-expression related to physical characteristics such as gender, race, and age. In most cases, communicators themselves will also suppress self-expression behaviors that deviate from the unified values or behavioral norms of society. Communicators in CMC will be in a situation that is more free relative to norms. In addition, the “anonymity” and “ease of participation and withdrawal” that form and maintain the communication environment in which communicators are located also have a certain impact in CMC.</p>
<p>Personal communication on the Internet is a liberation from social constraints, and 2ch provides an environment of “anonymity” and “availability to join and leave at any time”. Because 2ch guarantees that users can be liberated from social restrictions, users can carry out communication that is rarely expressed in daily life. Some players may indeed feel dissatisfied with certain aspects of a game, but it is not appropriate to complain about it in the game’s social network or discuss its negative factors in depth. Some players will express their opinions on anonymous platforms with relatively few restrictions, thereby achieving self-expression.</p>
<h3 id="Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model"><a href="#Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model" class="headerlink" title="Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model"></a>Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model</h3><p>Research related to the SIDE model is based on the hypothesis that “the lack of personal cues will make participants have a higher sense of group in their personal identity and mutual behavior, and increase their trust in the group and related rules”, with the purpose of investigating “anonymous CMC situations”. The method is to observe the group set in the laboratory. The observation results can be summarized as “in the case of anonymous communication with clear group characteristics, participants are often forced to be depersonalized. The result is that personal consciousness is lower than the consciousness as a group member. From the perspective of enhancing group member consciousness, two views can be derived: ① If the “group member” consciousness is higher than the “personal consciousness”, participants tend to obey situational norms. ② When participants are aware of their group identity, they tend to favor the internal group, discriminate against the external group, and have higher hostility towards the external group. And these characteristics can be found in 2ch.</p>
<h3 id="Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s"><a href="#Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s" class="headerlink" title="Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s"></a>Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s</h3><p>In the communication of young people after the 1990s, one effective view is “valuing relationship”. In other words, compared to conveying content, communicators pay more attention to the communication itself with others, that is, “communication for the sake of communication”. In the view of sociology, young people after 1995 have little resonance with the value system of mass media, but value the relationship with friends who are close to them. Similarly, although young people are more sensitive to the nature of their relationships with friends, they often enjoy this relationship. Young people are more concerned about intimate relationships, but more indifferent to the outside of intimate relationships.</p>
<p>In summary, the overall user profile of 5chan can be summarized as: young people who gather together due to the same interest, have a desire for self-expression, value internal relationships, have exclusionary psychology towards external groups, have stronger cohesion within the forum, and are more active in communication.</p>
<h2 id="2-Functional-Features-of-5chan"><a href="#2-Functional-Features-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="2. Functional Features of 5chan"></a>2. Functional Features of 5chan</h2><p>When studying the potential game community of 2ch, it is necessary to not only focus on the user characteristics of the entire 2ch forum, but also combine the functional characteristics of the 2ch forum itself.</p>
<p>Currently, 5chan has 39 main boards, and the main boards are further divided into sub-boards. Among them, there are three main boards related to games, namely games, mobile games, and online games. Under the main board, the platform will make a more detailed classification of games according to the type of game. The game board covers a wider range of games and contains more sub-boards. Users can click on the corresponding sub-board to enter the section after judging according to the type of game they want to browse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F87629d4e-2e96-4bfd-b5ca-a63b951486fc.png/size/"></p>
<p>After entering a sub-board, you can first see the content and theme discussed in the board. In order to prevent users from going to the wrong board and posting in the wrong place, links to connected or easily confused boards will be marked.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> belongs to the PC Action (PC action game) section, and the content discussed is all FPS, TPS, and action games running on Windows and other computers. Please go to other sections for other types of games, such as adult-oriented Galgames, online games, etc. Like Baidu Tieba, the board rules and posting rules are located at the top for new users to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do not reply to any troublemaking, inciting, prohibited topics, hit-and-run, or useless posts &gt;(repliers are also regarded as troublemakers)]</p>
<p>[Please confirm before posting]</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a public place. Please do not create useless posts unrelated to PC action games.</li>
<li>Please confirm that you have not posted in the wrong section.</li>
<li>Please search the [Post Overview] again to confirm that no one has posted duplicate or similar posts.</li>
<li>Series works should be posted in a unified post. Niche games should be based on the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crimes, illegal copying, software exchange, emulators, pornography, yellow jokes, attacks on fixed nicknames and individual players, and repeaters are prohibited. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F441c6f4c-26c0-4a26-a4f6-e275de8d9003.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F3ec9c3a9-5a9e-43df-a650-caedb3716dd5.png/size/"></p>
<p>This ensures that users who enter a certain post are first of all interested in the field where the post is located or have already understood it, and can communicate with people who have the same interest, and the speeches in the communication process follow the same forum rules and themes. Secondly, due to the secrecy of the retrieval system and the anonymity of users, 5chan is distinguished from some popular social media such as Twitter and completely open communication communities such as Discord.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the characteristics of the forum, the content of users’ speeches on 5chan will also be different from other communities. As mentioned above, the exclusionary psychology of 5chan users is reflected in the rules of the forum. They often prohibit new players from directly posting duplicate content without reading previous posts, or posting some content that is not worth posting separately. We believe that the rules that new users first read after entering 5chan will give them a feeling of entering an internal group from the public world, which will make them naturally abide by the rules of the internal group, otherwise they will be expelled by the internal group. The process of browsing the post history is not only a process of learning the rules of the internal group, but also a process of gradually recognizing their identity as an internal member.</p>
<p>In addition to the characteristics of user speeches, when searching for information on social media such as Twitter, it is usually a direct search or following some related tweeters. This will make users browse more than communicate even if they are interested in a certain field on social media. Even if they tweet to ask some content, they may not be answered. The unique Japanese habit of “FF-gai kara shitsurei shimasu” (I’m sorry to comment without following you or being followed by you) will also make the communication lengthy and complicated, and whether or not to follow will get a lot of redundant information that they don’t want. However, in a separate post of a certain game on 5chan, the desire for communication among members who belong to this internal group is greater than their desire for browsing, and the various conveniences of the forum also ensure that members can speak and discuss freely under the constraints of regulations. Therefore, the communication of users on the forum is more prosperous, and the feedback on the game will be directly posted on the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fed92bc22-2dd7-4ba1-9bc0-cecb8657c3df.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan"><a href="#3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan" class="headerlink" title="3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan"></a>3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan</h2><p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> thread in 5chan was created on November 12, 2020 during the game’s internal test, which triggered players’ discussions about the initial hero strength. Since the game had not yet been released, the thread also became inactive. In April 2021, the game was tested again, and because it was possible to directly experience the game, the discussion about the game in the thread was also more active. Players’ discussions during the game test can directly reflect the players’ real views on the game, guiding the development team to further improve the content of the game.</p>
<p>After the game was officially released, the discussion of the game was directly focused on the essence of the game - gameplay. In Japan, the solo mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is classified as a fighting game, and the release method of the character’s ultimate, the strength of the character, and the combos of various weapons have been discussed. For the parts other than the gameplay itself, the battle pass, and the face customization function, which is one of the hot spots of the game, can only be said to be rarely discussed. In addition to the discussion focused on the gameplay itself and the exchange and discussion of game techniques, unlike other communities, this is not a platform for making friends, so there is no pure personal showing off and unprovoked insults to other players, and due to the high degree of participation and cohesion, the questions raised by players can also be answered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F7823b4fb-e281-4c22-a4fa-b206b802edf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Compared with other social media, such as Twitter and Weibo, the visible range of content posted is filtered, requiring keyword searches or following someone, and the lack of anonymity and other functions also leads to users being unlikely to get interaction. Even if they can participate in the discussion in real time, it is difficult to form a discussion atmosphere where many people express their opinions on the same issue. In addition, due to visibility, word count limits, and disagreement with others, negative impressions posted on open large-scale social media may also cause disgust and lead to disputes. In contrast, 5chan first filters the participants in the discussion - players who have a certain understanding of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Secondly, the anonymity, functions, and its own cohesive characteristics of the forum make the discussion here more active and real, showing the players’ gaming experience, rather than meaningless complaints, spam, or recruitment information.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When understanding overseas game trends through research and capture of game communities, and then feeding back to game development, it is first necessary to understand the composition and characteristics of overseas communities in the target country. On the basis of further understanding user needs, apply them to the improvement of the game. The communities of each country will show different characteristics in their own culture and the evolution of Internet history, which is also a part worth paying attention to. How to use the characteristics reflected in the communities of each country to promote the game is also a topic that needs to be considered when expanding influence through communities.</p>
