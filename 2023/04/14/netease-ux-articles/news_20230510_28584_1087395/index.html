<p>Today, online reviews are an important channel for consumers to obtain product information, and their importance is even increasing. As the “trendsetters” of the Internet, game players are also active in major game review lists, forums, official Weibo accounts, super topics… Their comments on the game are a manifestation of the game’s reputation, and will become a reference for other players and even affect whether new players are willing to try it out.</p>
<p>When a player wants to see game-related news, they may go to TapTap to see the ratings, they may go to Weibo to see the hot topics, they may go to Tieba to see the guides, or they may go to the official account to see related news… What kind of impact do these TapTap ratings, comments under Weibo posts, and posts in Tieba have on viewers? This article starts from a psychological perspective, combining some psychological theories and examples to explain the interesting phenomena in the game review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/d56d36ae-ad72-48f6-85ee-18b60366fa25.png"></p>
<h2 id="1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words"><a href="#1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words" class="headerlink" title="1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?"></a>1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?</h2><p>Pictures and text are two main forms of reviews. People usually think that pictures are more convincing than text, the so-called “no picture, no truth”, but in the game field, are picture reviews also more effective than text reviews?</p>
<p>When players read reviews, it is actually a process of receiving, processing, and interpreting information. In psychology, there is a dual processing theory of widely disseminated information that can explain this process. This theory describes that in the process of information processing and decision-making, there are two independent but mutually influencing systems - the analytical system and the experiential system. The analytical system is biased towards the ideal, and requires relatively large cognitive resources to integrate information, and the process is relatively slow; while the experiential system is fast and relatively superficial.</p>
<p>After understanding the information processing process, let’s look at picture reviews and text reviews. For everyone, pictures are more concrete and intuitive than text. We can see the prominent content from the picture at a glance; while text can describe more essential information, but it requires a certain amount of reading and time to understand, and is more abstract than pictures.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific content, under the influence of the characteristics of different types of reviews, pictures can relatively activate the players’ experiential system, while text can activate the players’ analytical system. In this case, games, as a hedonic sensory product, picture reviews can provide some specific and intuitive player feelings, matching the fast experiential system processing path. Therefore, in the game review section, picture reviews are often more likely to influence players’ emotions than text reviews, that is, they are more effective. If the game is not a hedonic and sensory product, but a practical product, then text reviews are more useful than a “fancy” picture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/f17368ef-a770-4bae-a98b-1269b1aece40.png"></p>
<p>Of course, the real review section will not be like a psychology laboratory, with only single text reviews or picture reviews. There are also many content with both pictures and text, and then there will be a superimposed effect.</p>
<h2 id="2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews"><a href="#2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews"></a>2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews</h2><p>A review may be positive and complimentary, or it may be negative, critical, or even “flaming”. In psychology, the positive and negative and neutral aspects of a review are collectively referred to as “review valence.”</p>
<p>As everyone should know, positive reviews have a positive effect, and negative reviews will bring negative impressions and dissemination power, and the negative impact of negative reviews is higher than the impact of positive reviews. You can imagine whether a one-star negative review on TapTap has a much greater impact than a five-star positive review.</p>
<p>But for games, this special product, it is not difficult to find that in places like Tieba and forums, negative and neutral reviews are far more numerous than positive reviews, and this is mostly the case for games. In this case, the review section seems to cause a huge blow to the game. But in fact, we need to understand that behind these negative reviews are players with poor gaming experiences. Compared to players with more positive gaming experiences, they are more willing to speak out and express their “unhappiness”, on the one hand, to seek resonance, on the other hand, they also hope that the game official can improve these bad experiences in time; in addition, many psychology scholars have found through research that the effect of review valence is an inverted U-shaped curve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/c7e6933f-54bf-42af-b22f-ff21b44c0942.png"></p>
<p>The so-called inverted U-shaped curve describes that when people see reviews that are biased towards negative, they may have negative views on the product, but as more and more negative information appears and the degree becomes deeper, people’s trust in the reviews begins to rise and then declines. That is, compared with people’s extreme reviews, everyone is more inclined to believe in moderate review valence.</p>
<p>In addition to the content described by the review itself, the characteristics of the person viewing and reading the review will also have a great impact. This article briefly cites one example: the player’s own regulatory focus level. Regulatory focus level is a self-regulation process of people, divided into promotion focus and prevention focus. Promotion-focused players focus on growth, pay attention to positive results and magnify them, commonly speaking, they are more optimistic, and see more of “what can be gained”; while prevention-focused players focus on “what they will lose”, and strive to minimize their negative results.</p>
<p>To give a common example, a player draws a prize in the game, and the probability of winning is 80%. A promotion-focused player will feel that their probability of winning is very close to 100%, and it seems to be within easy reach, eager to try; while a prevention-focused player believes that they have a 20% chance of not getting it, and they are concerned about what they might lose.</p>
<p>Observing the relationship between the player’s own regulatory focus level and review valence, it is not difficult to find that for promotion-focused players, positive reviews are more useful than negative reviews, and they pay more attention to the positive gains in the reviews; while for prevention-focused players, negative reviews have a greater impact than positive reviews.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Official Responses"></a>3. The Role of Official Responses</h2><p>When we look at the review sections of some games, we often find a phenomenon, that is, the official “picks” or replies. In addition to the transmission of information itself, these replies actually have other effects.</p>
<p>Official replies have a positive effect on users. Let’s not talk about the specific content of the reply, but the behavior itself has a positive impact - research shows that in terms of the game development team directly facing the voices of players, direct interaction with everyone and collecting suggestions is a manifestation of the developer’s operation plan. A high reply rate reflects the official’s good operation planning and attitude to a certain extent. In games, the active response of the official shows that the development team attaches great importance to the suggestions of players, pays attention to everyone’s feedback and the status of the game, and also helps potential “cloud players” get to know the official and reduce the perceived negative risks. Some players even call for replies from the official in the review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/d7b0e7b7-7122-493e-825a-36319208caf3.png"></p>
<p>So, how should game developers reply to players in order to achieve better results? This is related to the persona, the timeliness of the reply, and the specific form of the review.</p>
<p>First, you can consider positioning a specific persona. Why have a persona? For players, most development teams are far away from them. Even if the developers feel that they are listening to what players say most of the time and use it as a basis for changes, many players still don’t notice. When trying to communicate with players, targeted replies can indeed close this distance, but replies from the cold “xxx development team” and “xxx planner” are not obvious in closing the distance. If a clear persona can be established, especially one that is combined with the game’s own mechanics, worldview, characters, etc., it can have a better effect in closing the distance, easing the atmosphere, and operating the community. The cute loli of two-dimensional games, the female priest in the Western medieval background, the commander of FPS or military games, the injured companion of the doomsday survival game, etc., are all specific personas brewed by game developers under this strategy.</p>
<p>The second is the timeliness of the reply. Diagnostic theory refers to the process by which people judge the importance of a piece of information to themselves when they come into contact with it. Therefore, when information with high diagnostic value appears, people will immediately be attracted by this information and use it to help them make judgments. The official reply is diagnostic information in the entire review process, and the faster the official reply speed, the more it can grasp the player’s psychology in time, reflecting the high efficiency of the producer and the importance attached to the player. For example, the timely response of the game <em>UNO!</em> on TapTap reflects the players’ love for the official’s timely response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>![](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/2da6cf05-a38b-41d4-bac3-de96eed32eee.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230510/2da6cf05-a38b-41d4-bac3-de96eed32eee.png</a>. </p>

<p>How the producer replies to the player is also related to the specific form of the review. In the game’s review section, we will see some negative reviews. In response to these negative reviews, is it better to “admit mistakes” and reply “will improve”, or to analyze the reasons for the player’s negative experience with the player? This is actually related to whether the player’s evaluation is emotional or attribute-based.</p>
<p>Emotional evaluation refers to the player’s overall evaluation is relatively subjective, without the support of various examples, such as “so bad”, “don’t like” and other replies full of emotional words. At this time, if the official reply “admits mistakes”, apologizes and promises to improve, the player will further attribute the responsibility of the problem to the producer itself, and think that the official is perfunctory to him&#x2F;her. At this time, a “defensive” reply will be more useful, such as appropriately introducing the better aspects of the game to the player, reducing the player’s bad attribution to the game itself; while attribute-based evaluation is relatively objective compared to emotional evaluation, and will describe specific problems. At this time, a reply of “admitting mistakes” is more useful, supplemented by specific improvement plans may make players feel the sincerity of the official.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>This article mainly introduces the form of reviews, positive and negative valence, and some content of official replies, and discusses them in conjunction with relevant psychological theories. In fact, there are many more interesting phenomena in the review section, and the degree of influence of reviews on players is also different. Paying attention to the review section can help user researchers and development teams better understand players’ thoughts and needs, and explore the possibility of attracting new players.</p>
