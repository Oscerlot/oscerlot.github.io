</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game White Paper” released in January 2023 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Content Agency, in 2021, the global market share of Korean games reached 7.6%, second only to the United States, China, and Japan. It is the fourth largest game market in the world, with an annual consumption of 20.9913 trillion won (about 109.6 billion yuan). This figure is expected to reach 22.7 trillion won in 2022.</p>
<p>As a mainstream region for games to go overseas, many domestic companies are targeting the huge potential market of South Korea and launching localized game versions. In the localization process, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the characteristics of local players and make corresponding adjustments. Socially, players like in-game social interaction and also value communication in the game community. An in-depth understanding of the characteristics and needs of Korean game players can provide more targeted help for game localization.</p>
<h2 id="1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games"><a href="#1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games"></a>1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games</h2><p>Many players like to socialize in games, and Korean games also take advantage of this, encouraging players to cooperate or compete with other players. They generally provide a variety of social functions in the game, such as chat rooms, teams, and guilds, and support players to share game experiences in the game community to meet players’ social needs. This not only enriches the game content, but also promotes communication between players, and is an important means to improve player stickiness and loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Methods"><a href="#Social-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Social Methods"></a>Social Methods</h3><p>Many players regard games as a way of socializing, maintaining friendships and making new friends through games, expanding their social circle.</p>
<p>For many Korean players, games can be a way of socializing. Newzoo’s 2022 Korean player report shows that the biggest reason Korean players play games is for social interaction (18%). Playing games with friends can both kill time and enhance relationships. Therefore, most Korean games also incorporate social elements. For example, some games integrate the communication function of the social chat software Kakao, which can contact and add Kakao friends, and provide exclusive emoticon stickers for Kakao users, which is a relatively effective social marketing strategy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F4e5d19c9-8faf-4e80-b0b5-72992d64de48.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game Player Status Survey Report” (hereinafter referred to as the player survey), among PC game players, in addition to “relieving stress” and “killing time”, 30.2% of players choose “playing games with friends and family”. This ratio is higher among young players, and also shows that players in their 10s to 30s pay more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F805c7d37-fea7-4343-bf56-a1cbed438fbb.png/size/"></p>
<p>However, this ratio is only 13.4% among mobile game players. However, in addition to the convenience of mobile phones and the fun of the game itself, the second most important element for mobile game players is social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F1eab54c8-7e90-41aa-8e90-0b1494355dad.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, for mobile game players, 28.5% of players will use direct recommendations from friends as a reference for downloading new games, which is as important as the app store (Google Play, App Store, One Store) ranking reference. It can be seen that friends’ recommendations are an important factor that cannot be ignored. Playing the social element card well is also conducive to the game gaining more new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ffda97707-70b0-44f8-a29c-c5bd5ac2acf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Korean PC bangs (internet cafes) are also an important part of their game industry, and the social nature of Korean PC bang players is particularly significant. According to a player survey, 57.3% of people who go to PC bangs to play games do so to play games with friends&#x2F;colleagues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe784115b-d3e0-4ae0-b7cc-329fe07cb6a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, in the post-epidemic era, the trend of game social interaction has been reflected in players around the world. A study by Ipsos in conjunction with “Google for Games”, &lt;2022 The Shifting Needs of Global Mobile Gamers&gt;, shows that many players build connections with others through mobile games. Although people have gradually resumed offline social activities after the epidemic, online social habits have remained, and more and more players tend to communicate with others in games, replacing some offline social interactions. Sometimes, friends in the game even feel closer than acquaintances in life. Especially for Korean players, the game motivation of “having a common topic with others”, which is related to social purposes, has become stronger in the past year. It can be seen that players are paying more and more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb645e70f-cf63-4f54-8071-497c9abb328a.png/size/"></p>
<p>In Newzoo’s research on game driving forces, it was found that the reasons for Chinese players’ gaming behavior are also relatively obvious. Games involving competition, exploration, and strategy are more directly attractive to players, while social purposes are lower than these factors. Another Newzoo survey of Japanese players shows that the three main motivations for Japanese players to play games are “relaxation and stress relief” (50%), “filling free time” (49%), and “exploring the game storyline” (45%). Only 13% of players play for social reasons (global average 25%), and only 11% play for the sense of competition and the joy of victory. It can be seen that emphasis on competitiveness and social interaction is more obvious in Korean players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb3a07c89-fb25-47cc-9a12-a8967d24ffe4.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fbad82401-206a-465f-af06-0f5565257bd2.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Game-Communities"><a href="#Game-Communities" class="headerlink" title="Game Communities"></a>Game Communities</h3><p>Secondly, the development of game communities has also become a favorable booster for player communication, including game forums, offline activities, and other forms. Korean game communities have developed rapidly, providing players with game-related information, functional, and interactive services. In South Korea, the local game unofficial communities with a relatively large number of users include DCinside, inven, and ruliweb. In the April popular community ranking, two pure game communities (inven, ruliweb) occupied the top five. The top-ranked comprehensive community, DCinside, also has a dedicated game section. These communities provide players with a more free discussion space, where they can find game content that players are more concerned about, and problems encountered by players, which helps to follow up on player feedback and public opinion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F06dbfe41-b734-4305-ba3f-3bfa0e687513.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, as a high-quality martial arts battle royale game, requires team cooperation and communication. <em>Naraka</em>’s Korean players have spontaneously established game groups on Discord, DC, and Kakao, sharing game-related information, sharing operations, displaying drawn skins and character customization data, discussing update information, helping other players solve various problems encountered during the game, and also looking for teammates to form teams, and even participating in competitions together. These forums or communities provide a platform for players to communicate, discuss the latest event plans, observe the operations of experts, find teammates to play together, and extend the feelings in the game to outside the game. A good community atmosphere is also conducive to attracting players and improving player retention.</p>
<p>At the same time, the community is also a window for game developers to communicate with players. Games that listen carefully to player feedback in forums, respect player opinions, and make timely improvements can also gain player recognition. For example, Smilegate’s MMORPG <em>LOST ARK</em> received many negative reviews on image quality, automatic combat, balance, etc. when it was first launched, but the development team promised players that it would make improvements, and after the update, it solved more than 90% of the problems and removed the content that players did not like. After the Season 2 update, the game’s daily visits increased by 122%, new players increased by 542%, and returning players increased by 213%. The development team even received support advertisements from players. Players highly praised Smilegate’s effective communication and active community operation.</p>
<h3 id="Esports-Culture"><a href="#Esports-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Esports Culture"></a>Esports Culture</h3><p>Third, the booming esports culture in South Korea is also an important part of its game social interaction. Many players pay attention to esports events and enjoy the social experience brought by the game by participating, watching, and commenting on esports events.</p>
<p>South Korea has played a significant role in promoting the development of esports. In 1998, <em>StarCraft</em> changed the landscape of the Korean game industry. Under the influence of the Asian financial crisis, the esports industry attracted the attention of capital and ushered in huge development. The concept of professional players was born. After the financial crisis, the Korean esports industry also received government support. Now, Korean esports has formed a relatively mature industrial model and is also an important part of Korean game culture. Esports competitions are very popular in South Korea and have a large audience. Korean players’ love and attention to esports are also very high. Esports activities are both competition events and social activities. Players watch esports live broadcasts, comment and communicate, reflecting Korean players’ enthusiasm for game competition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fd4a652fa-7559-4600-995d-a53453d1cba3.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Localization-Suggestions"><a href="#2-Localization-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Suggestions"></a>2. Localization Suggestions</h2><p>It can be seen that the Korean game market has huge potential and is also one of the important landing points for games to go overseas. Therefore, when launching games overseas, it is also necessary to fully understand the characteristics and preferences of local players, and deeply customize them during research and development, localization, and continuous operation, so that they can be welcomed by more players in the local market.</p>
<h3 id="Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game"><a href="#Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Community Operation Outside the Game"></a>Community Operation Outside the Game</h3><p>First, it is necessary to pay attention to community operation, focus on community building and interaction, and encourage players to share game experiences and insights.</p>
<p>Korean game communities have diverse forms and rich content, and different types of communities have a wide range of influence among Korean game players. Players share game guides and exchange game experiences in game forums, which can not only improve their game skills, but also promote interaction and social interaction between game players. By holding various activities such as competitions and lucky draws, mobilizing players’ enthusiasm can not only enhance players’ feelings, but also deepen the connection between players and the game.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Social-Gameplay"><a href="#In-Game-Social-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Social Gameplay"></a>In-Game Social Gameplay</h3><p>Secondly, the gameplay should also consider the social needs and habits of Korean players. <em>StarCraft</em> set off a wave of Korean game competition in the last century, driving the development of PC bangs and allowing players to experience the joy of competition in the game. Nowadays, the RTS, FPS, and MMORPG games that Korean players love also pay attention to the social needs of players. Strengthening players’ sense of belonging to guilds and teams, developing interesting multiplayer gameplay and team gameplay, convenient chat and friend systems, friend trading, reasonable ranking and achievement systems, etc., will give players a better experience.</p>
<p>In-depth research on Korean players before release and during continuous operation will help accurately capture the differences in social needs of different player groups and help the game better establish a player social network in South Korea. In the game, communicating, exploring, and cooperating with partners to complete difficult tasks and win over other opponents, so that high-quality games can build a bridge for players’ friendship, may also be an important meaning of the game itself.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players in various countries have user characteristics that cannot be ignored. To do a good job in localization, it is also necessary to have a deeper understanding of players, grasp player needs, and provide corresponding services according to the game in order to better retain players and achieve common growth. Games are an important part of Korean players’ social lives. Players value in-game social interaction, friend communication, actively participate in game communities, and enjoy the fun of esports. In the process of localization, you can start from two aspects: in-game social interaction and out-of-game social marketing. Develop convenient friend and guild systems in the game, actively maintain the community outside the game, improve player stickiness, consider players’ social needs, and formulate strategies that are consistent with the characteristics of the game itself while taking into account players’ social habits.</p>
<p>Of course, the most core competitiveness is undoubtedly relying on high-quality content, including the core of key gameplay and the appearance of exquisite art. On this basis, targeted adjustments made for local players can be the icing on the cake.</p>
