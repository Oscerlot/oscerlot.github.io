</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the development of mobile information technology, the technology of obtaining users’ geographical coordinates through signals has been widely used in all aspects of our lives. Naturally, geographic location information has also been widely used in games.</p>
<p>When it comes to game design based on geographic location information, the first thing that comes to mind is probably <em>Pokémon GO</em>. The gameplay of this game is based on augmented reality (AR) technology. Players need to collect, battle, and train Pokémon in the real world. In addition, based on LBS (Location Based Services) technology, players can deeply integrate the real map with the game screen and explore in the real world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ffac7fbb0-c573-4f56-a1a8-ee7a1e81ce0f.png/size/"></p>
<p>But in fact, in addition to being embedded in the gameplay, geographic location information also plays a positive role in the design of other game systems. This article will start from the system functions and briefly discuss the application of geographic location information in the design of game system functions and the positive effects it brings.</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements"><a href="#1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements"></a>1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements</h2><p>In some games with high DAU, it is very difficult for individual players to get on the global leaderboard. For those players who do not have the strength to get on the global leaderboard, but have a high demand for achievement goals, sub-leaderboards can meet their needs for a sense of achievement. The more detailed the leaderboard, the more achievement goal directions players can pursue – “With so many leaderboards, I can always excel in one.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F678a763f-437f-4511-b0fc-80cef6a46a2b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to in-game attributes, many games now introduce the concept of players’ provinces and cities in reality, and divide player groups based on players’ geographic information, so that players in the same group are in a large leaderboard. It is common in some games with strong confrontation. For example, in <em>Onmyoji Arena</em>, which everyone is familiar with, the game ranks players of each Shikigami in their province and city. The ranking reflects the level of players playing a certain hero. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Fce2bf088-2ec0-48e1-a947-14d718ff59d5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Such a regionally-subdivided ranking, first of all, will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking. Players may have a vague perception of how many people are playing a game in the country, but their cognition of how many people are playing around them is clearer. For example, “Shanghai’s No. 1 Yoto Hime”, friends in Shanghai will have a relatively concrete feeling of the weight of this “No. 1”.</p>
<p>Secondly, the relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Friends who can get together in reality have similar life trajectories, and most of them live in nearby areas, so they have a stronger sense of the fun of regional ranking topics. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate you to pursue the ranking. For example, we are going to have a five-player game in a party. I don’t know many heroes and I quickly choose Oitsuki. My friend says, “I’ll take the mid lane, you just lie down and win. Let me, Hangzhou’s No. 8 Higanbana, carry you.” It’s not that I really care about my friend’s skills, but this kind of talk makes people feel “Oh, that’s interesting”, and the feedback from everyone increases Higanbana’s pride in this ranking.</p>
<p>This kind of ranking based on geographic location grouping is not limited to the form of a leaderboard. There are also common regional online events. Players in the same region are used as a group for internal competition, and the winning players will get corresponding achievements in the game. Although it is not in the form of a leaderboard, it can also motivate players to pursue their achievement goals. For example, the China Online Tour in <em>UNO!</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F462b365e-d0f8-4b4b-b9e6-05e52f479a84.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition"><a href="#2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition"></a>2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition</h2><p>In addition to ranking within the group, ranking with geographic location as a natural group link and group as a unit will also motivate players’ game behavior. For example, in <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, which went viral on the Internet at the end of 2022, for this game with a very low clearance rate, on the one hand, players all hope to be the lucky one to clear the level with a small probability. On the other hand, the reason why many players keep playing tirelessly may be to help their province’s sheep team to be on the top sheep list of the day. The extremely low clearance rate and the setting of ranking by region as a group greatly stimulate players’ desire for challenge and sense of collective honor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ff7d70648-f953-45c3-9336-af55c979bb03.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, regional ranking is more of a group achievement, and the individual’s sense of achievement is not so strong. At first glance, you may wonder why this regional ranking can also motivate players. This involves the relationship between individual interests and group interests. Group members will unite against outsiders, and individuals belonging to the group will hope that the group will develop better. It is a behavioral preference rooted in the human genes. The formation of this preference is related to the development of human ethnic groups, which has always been in groups.</p>
<p>First of all, people living in the same area often have a sense of belonging and identity, believing that they are a part of this place, so they have the responsibility and obligation to contribute to this place, so as to maintain and enhance the interests of their community or region. In addition, our traditional culture emphasizes the relationship between individuals and society relatively more, advocating that individuals contribute to society. Under the influence of this culture, players may have a stronger sense of responsibility and obligation to their location. And some regions are relatively strong in culture or economy, which may enhance the pride of local people in their regional identity, thereby enhancing their motivation to “help the sheep team of their province to be on the top sheep list of the day.”</p>
<h2 id="3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience"><a href="#3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience"></a>3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience</h2><p>The most basic use of geographic location information in games is that in the player’s personal information, the player can choose to display their city coordinates. With coordinate information, when other players view your profile, if your cities are geographically close, or even in the same city, you can quickly identify it. For example, in MMO games, players often have an in-game personal information display page, where players can display their city coordinates. Of course, players can also choose not to display them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F36833c5d-735a-4e36-ade5-323c59cefe95.png/size/"></p>
<p>Some games apply the distance information between the two parties in more detail. For example, in <em>Onmyoji</em>, players can see the distance between the speaker and their real coordinates in the chat channel. Even the game chat channel directly opens “Nearby”, which is convenient for players to directly find and interact with nearby like-minded people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F293cf958-98ae-41e9-9106-37d307478b98.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to individuals, the game also adds the dimension of geographic location information to group interaction. Players can use the geographic location service (LBS) function to associate their location information with the Onmyoji guild. First of all, the game requires choosing a real coordinate to create a guild. Players can use the LBS function to search for nearby guilds in the real world and join them. Based on such functional logic, most of the players in the same guild are near the guild coordinates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F5b2a2907-aa74-4403-a13d-3fd9c7c6f868.png/size/"></p>
<p>The game will design such a geographic location service in social functions, which actually hits the preference that players always prefer people who are geographically closer in social interactions with strangers. This preference exists even if players do not consider meeting in person or transforming these online social interactions into offline ones.</p>
<p>The psychological distance theory believes that, taking the direct experience of the results of this time, this place, certainty, and oneself as the origin, any indirect experience in any dimension is psychologically distant. Things are scattered in the psychological space according to different dimensions, forming different types of psychological distance. Psychological distance includes four dimensions: time distance, space distance, social distance, and probability distance.</p>
<p>Players usually use various attributes as a measure of the social distance between themselves and other players, such as similar interests and hobbies (same hobby group) and similar strength levels (game combat power or rank). Similar spatial distance is also a natural attribute that quickly shortens the social distance between players, which means that the closer the players are in geographical distance, the higher their initial closeness to each other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F9382b0d7-3c9c-4c4e-9421-7b6fede7a895.png/size/"></p>
<p>And in the process of interaction, the advantages brought by geographic location are not only at the beginning. Friends who are geographically close can continue to receive more attention from players. In-group favoritism is a pattern of cognitive behavior, which means that individuals form an identity with people in the group, and therefore give more positive evaluations, allocate more resources, while giving more negative evaluations or allocating fewer resources to people outside the group. The proximity of geographic location is a kind of in-group division mark. This kind of in-group preference based on geographic area can encourage these players to communicate and support each other more, such as the phenomenon of people in the same area forming groups. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F3a2fd2db-bedd-4586-85fb-377de9c0db61.png/size/"></p>
<p>Players will prefer people who are geographically closer, which may be influenced by past social experience in addition to natural human cognitive preferences - they find that people from similar regions are more talkative and get along better. Playing games with people who are close to the geographic area, due to similarities in living background, language, cultural customs, and daily travel trajectories, it is easier to establish a common experience and common identity, thereby enhancing the sense of belonging and emotional connection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for players who have a need gap in real-world social interaction, although they are socializing in the online world, they essentially still hope to establish relatively stable social relationships. Scholar Sherry Turkle (2005) calls the identity in the virtual online world “mud” - it has fluidity, can play with and shape its own form at will, and play different roles.</p>
<p>In the world of online games, the identity of strangers is difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the truth seems to be unimportant. Because strangers lack the fulcrum of real connection, they are like duckweed that blows away. Real connection means the relative authenticity of identity, reducing the sense of haziness and ambiguity in the process of interaction. Therefore, if the online relationship is to develop further, it must provide some kind of certainty and build a trust mechanism. Players who are geographically close are more likely to have some offline contact, such as offline gatherings, group games, etc. The “face-to-face” meeting link can reduce the uncertainty of online identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F6a1ec6b0-141c-4cae-b370-eaca63fc89e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The social penetration theory believes that the degree of self-disclosure between the two parties is the core of relationship development. The more offline contact, the more real life players present to each other. While increasing mutual trust, they will also show more aspects of real self-exposure in reality. Players have more bonds with each other, promoting the transformation of weak social ties into strong ties, and are more likely to settle into stable social relationships.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The application of geographic location information can play a certain role in motivating players’ social interaction, sense of achievement, etc. When conducting game design, we can better utilize these aspects to bring beneficial effects to the game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using players’ geographic information as a dimension of leaderboards to motivate players to pursue achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The difficulty of getting on the global leaderboard is greater. The more diversified the leaderboard, the more leaderboard achievement-seeking players can be covered.</li>
<li>Regional leaderboards will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking.</li>
<li>The relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate players to pursue the ranking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divide groups based on players’ geographic information to increase motivation for competition:</strong><br>People living in the same area often have a sense of belonging and identity, believing that they are a part of this place and want to maintain and enhance the interests of their community or region. Our traditional culture emphasizes the relationship between individuals and society relatively more, and Chinese players have a stronger sense of pursuit of group ranking goals.</p>
