<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With social progress and technological iteration, the form of social interaction has undergone various evolutions. From offline to online, the roles, spaces, and scenes of social interaction are constantly being reconstructed. People’s desire for expression and sharing has not diminished, and the social battleground has gradually shifted online. On the one hand, mature social products are emerging one after another, and on the other hand, games have become the social medium for most modern people, becoming a virtual scene carrying social interaction and also a topic of conversation after dinner.</p>
<p>From the perspective of game production and operation, game social interaction is an old topic. According to iResearch data, among all the reasons why domestic players leave a mobile game, “weak social attributes” account for 31%, ranking first in guiding players to “abandon the game”.</p>
<p>So, why is social interaction so important in games?</p>
<p>For manufacturers, social content is different from one-time consumable content (such as new storylines). It has low production pressure and strong sustainability. Most online games rely on social interaction to maintain player investment in the later stages, and social interaction between players is also an important part of revitalizing the game ecology. For players, interacting with others in the game can bring experiences such as a sense of identity, belonging, and superiority, which is also the main pleasure in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>Social interaction in games often revolves around collaboration, competition, supply and demand, etc., and combines with appropriate relationships to form an overall social structure. For example, players of the same level use warrior, mage, and priest class combinations to achieve combat division of labor. Players of different levels establish common goals for collaboration through large organizations, or achieve hard social needs through profit sharing and resource trading.</p>
<p>In the home system, social interaction gameplay often starts from the leisure perspective of the game, and creates more entertaining social experiences without putting pressure on players. Compared with traditional social interaction, home social interaction is more “leisurely”, “loving”, and “healing”. It allows players to interact with acquaintances or strangers without pressure, and can better help players integrate into the social ecology of the virtual world. This is the current general environment, and it is also a social scene that more players will pursue in future games. Therefore, the social interaction in the home system should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In past contacts with various game players, we found that there are many types of home social gameplay. The core pleasures of players are mainly divided into the following categories: management-oriented pleasure, home construction-oriented pleasure, and pure social-oriented pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="1-Home-Resource-Exchange"><a href="#1-Home-Resource-Exchange" class="headerlink" title="1. Home Resource Exchange"></a>1. Home Resource Exchange</h2><p>Driving social interaction with transactions is the most common way, and it is no exception in the home system. Like players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> exchanging specialties for cross-island trade, and players in <em>Revelation M</em> visiting friends’ homes to find daily flower merchants to buy rare flower seeds to exchange for home coins, this “differentiation” and “scarcity” can effectively mobilize players’ enthusiasm and motivate players to visit each other’s homes.</p>
<p>Specifically, taking <em>Animal Crossing</em> as an example, many players who enjoy collecting say that social interaction (going to other people’s islands) is a “rigid need” of the game. Because players are born in the southern or northern hemisphere, they have different (seasonal limited) insects and fish in different seasons, and these two contents account for a large proportion of the game’s collection elements. Although there are seasonal changes, due to the game’s time being synchronized with reality, in order to achieve the purpose of rapid collection, players need to travel between the two hemispheres, and visiting each other has become a necessary social link in the game. </p>

<hr>
<p>In addition, <em>Animal Crossing</em> also incorporates many random events, such as furniture, flower seeds, floor wallpapers randomly refreshed in the store, clothing sold in the clothing store unlocked with progress, and some random limited events such as carpet merchants and meteor showers (this type of event is an important way for players to obtain rare items). The random factors mean that visiting friends or strangers from time to time can discover new surprises, further stimulating players’ desire for this type of social interaction. </p>

Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home"></a>2. Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home</h2><p>Reciprocal (helping friends water flowers, pick vegetables, etc.) and entertaining (playing the piano, dancing, playing chess, playing cards, etc.) are common multi-person interactions in the home. Furniture interactions that can create beautiful memories together and casual mini-games where you can talk and laugh together are also social needs that players have high voices for. </p>

<hr>
<p>In addition to small interactive props or casual gameplay, many players believe that holding party activities at home is also a great tool to promote social interaction in players’ small circles. For example, players who have participated in the <em>Heartopia</em> test have said that the free party is the social interaction they prefer. From preparing food and fireworks to inviting neighbors to the house, and then interacting together after the party officially starts, and finally taking a group photo, it’s a perfect ending. It is worth mentioning that the seemingly formal party gameplay has no substantial material rewards. What players can gain is the opportunity to become friends with neighbors who come to the appointment. </p>

Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities"></a>3. Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities</h2><p>In addition to visiting each other, co-living with multiple friends, interacting and entertaining, and creating a self-world for small groups are also the home social needs of many players. Couples&#x2F;roommate players in <em>Mole’s World</em> are quite fond of the process of building a home bit by bit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F75d8ddf3-1b68-4715-93bd-c65ba3c25bb8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Mole’s World》 - Public storage box for furniture, both parties can move their furniture into the public storage box for management and decoration</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similarly, <em>Justice Online</em>‘s multi-player manor also satisfies the “cohabitation” needs of many small group players. Even if they are on different servers from their friends, they can break the barriers between servers and gather multiple friends to build a manor together, creating a team building paradise.</p>
<p>In the community-like design of “Qiyunji”, players can think about how to plan the area of the entire manor together with their friends and conceive the overall manor style. In addition to home construction, players can also go fishing in Bixi or cooperate in treasure hunting with their close friends, interact with their friends’ pet cats and dogs, and even transform into a chef, show off their superb cooking skills, and prepare a table of delicacies for their friends. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fe0764a49-f399-4502-a3e4-08fd27b7a339.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Justice Online》 - Everyone is fishing together in the manor</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to such acquaintance communities, homes (or rather, communities) can also become opportunities and situations for stranger social interaction.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Heartopia</em> players also mentioned that the game’s special home social mechanism brought them unexpected surprises. Because each time you enter the game, up to 12 players will be randomly assigned to the same town, and players will meet 11 different people every day. The neighbor you passed by yesterday may be replaced the next time you log in.</p>
<p>The random mechanism creates distance for players who don’t like social interaction, and also brings a special social experience to the town. Every time you log in, there will be new neighbors, and new neighbors have the opportunity to become friends. From small things like watering flowers and playing with cats for neighbors, and completing a two-person action with neighbors, to big things like holding a party and inviting neighbors in the town to visit… In the end, it may precipitate a larger and more dynamic social network. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F6459c8e3-cd67-4104-94b7-1eaffb6664b3.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes"><a href="#4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes" class="headerlink" title="4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes"></a>4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes</h2><p>The home system is often accompanied by highly free construction and decoration gameplay. In addition to creating and designing their ideal beautiful homes, players are also committed to creating various fancy things by building houses, and this kind of curiosity-seeking fancy things can usually attract a large number of players and bring active spontaneous social interaction.</p>
<p>Some players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> like to try to move real scenes into the game and record important events in their lives that are ceremonial. For example, Japanese pixel artist BAN-8KU held a virtual exhibition “Kitten Exhibition”, attracting a large number of players to visit; a Twitter player named WhimsyWool moved her canceled graduation ceremony to the game, and the 18-second video instantly received 1.5 million views and 200,000 likes; many players also held weddings in Animal Crossing during the epidemic and posted them on social media, inviting netizens to witness together… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F830719a1-00e1-4443-a9e7-a87a02ecfcb4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Animal Crossing》 - Holding art exhibitions, job fairs, graduation ceremonies, weddings</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similar social situations also appear in domestic mobile games. The master players of <em>Mole’s World</em> decorate their homes into online bathhouses, internet cafes, bars, couple cinemas, hot spring hotels, study gardens… and invite netizens to check in online. Overnight, they became internet celebrity shops, attracting many players to follow the trend and queue up to visit. Players continue to post check-in guides and experiences on Weibo, Xiaohongshu and other platforms, and <em>Mole’s World</em> has also frequently gone out of the circle on social media because of this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F84348c80-d917-4d9a-82ab-a50055b36653.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%21%5BMole%20Manor%20Internet%20Cafe%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F8f3a1017-3f89-45c8-b85a-c7df0c57c07d.png/size/" alt="Mole Manor Bar"></p>
<p>What’s more, many players in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> buy houses to open RP shops (role play), providing various scenes for immersive role-playing, from small bars and teahouses, nightclubs and dance halls, schools and libraries, bathhouses and hotels, to large churches and museums, haunted houses and dungeon secret rooms, amusement parks and divination houses, photography studios, and even host clubs. Players’ brains are wide open, and they have played different tricks with the housing system.</p>
<p>Regarding RP shops, players can independently decorate their houses, become shop owners, hire people to play NPCs, and attract customers to consume; they can also find a favorite shop to apply for, play NPCs, and serve players who come to consume, such as providing services&#x2F;item transactions according to the menu and price list, providing chat and play services, playing musical instruments or dancing; they can also just visit and consume, or chat with NPCs or other players in the shop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Ffe9f8868-9d7f-469b-ac35-ea2b7a5690db.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《FF14》 - Theater RP &amp; Audience Appreciation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the long run, the RP shop industry chain has been derived in the game ecology. Players who want to play NPCs and players who want to contact NPCs each have their own fun, and gradually become a major feature of the game culture. In addition to promoting social interaction, RP shops have a certain stimulus for the demand for housing, furniture, and character costumes, and are also helpful to the economic cycle of the game. From this, we can also glimpse some inspiration for the commercialization of the game from the home system.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>In summary, the social interaction carried out by players through the home system and the fun obtained during the social interaction are nothing more than three kinds. One is the social interaction derived from management-oriented pleasure (stealing vegetables&#x2F;watering&#x2F;feeding&#x2F;special resource acquisition &amp; exchange, etc.), the second is the social interaction derived from home construction-oriented pleasure (display &amp; invitation to visit experience&#x2F;co-building home, etc.), and the third is pure social-oriented pleasure (social interaction in the home - interactive props&#x2F;social gameplay).</p>
<p>For the home as a social scene, most players care about whether they can simulate real life and feel the lively atmosphere of life. They regard the home as a leisure place for acquaintance social interaction, and will party, chat, dance, and hold weddings with friends in the home. At the same time, they do not exclude meeting friendly strangers through the home system and will interact. At the same time, the home is no longer limited to one person’s small home, but gradually forms a multi-person family, a community of more people, thus forming a social circle.</p>
<p>It is precisely this kind of non-mandatory and non-strong goal-oriented social interaction that makes players pay more attention to their social feelings of being cared for and valued, and it is precisely this kind of interaction that makes players actively deepen the connection between each other, and the home gradually evolves into a spiritual dwelling place in the virtual world.</p>
