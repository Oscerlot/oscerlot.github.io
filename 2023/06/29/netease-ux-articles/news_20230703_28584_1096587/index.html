<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1956, American psychologist George Miller published a paper titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” which discussed the relationship between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. The number of alternatives for one-dimensional absolute judgment hovers around 7, which is roughly equivalent to the limit of short-term memory. That is, the memory span of young people is about 7 units (Arabic numerals, letters, words, or other units). Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not absolute, and it is also related to the length, complexity, and memory proficiency of the memory unit.</p>
<p>This is Miller’s Law, which is widely respected in design.</p>
<p>Miller’s Law is one of the earliest research results on the content of short-term memory, and it is still widely applicable in design. For example, designers will consciously reduce the amount and complexity of information presented to users at the same time, actively integrate information, and adopt modular methods. These are the most basic practices of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>As a common scene of rapid thinking and short-term memory, game design should naturally conform to Miller’s Law. Next, this article will show you some design practices related to Miller’s Law in current games.</p>
<h2 id="1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden"><a href="#1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden" class="headerlink" title="1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden"></a>1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden</h2><p>People’s memory processing of information is limited. Usually, the more information there is, the harder it is for us to remember. This is a relatively easy-to-understand explanation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the easiest way to think of is to simply and rudely reduce the amount of information to reduce the user’s understanding burden. Facts have proved that reducing the amount of information is indeed quite effective. At present, the number of information chunks presented in people’s mobile phone software has basically not exceeded the range of “7±2”. The same is true for games.</p>
<p>But in fact, 20 years ago, Miller’s Law did not receive attention from designers in game design. MMORPG games in the early 21st century, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em>, had extremely “terrifying” skill buttons spread across the bottom of the screen. Some complex professions even had to press more than 20 skill buttons in a skill cycle! Although not all scenes need to use so many skills, the extremely complex key settings will still bring trouble to the player’s operation and memory, especially increasing the entry threshold for new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F600fd181-6960-40ae-95e6-e03c8d6430db.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The complex skill keys in “World of Warcraft” greatly increase the difficulty of getting started</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Later, with the emergence of MOBA games such as DOTA and LOL, this problem was alleviated. Take LOL as an example. Almost all heroes only have the following commonly used keys: 4 skills + 2 summoner skills + several equipment skills (basically no more than two). This falls exactly within the “7±2” range. The practice of Miller’s Law is actually one of the reasons why MOBA games are easy to get started and popular all over the world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F08229701-ce61-41f3-b6fd-cfa7ebd739b0.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The hero skill interface of LOL is much simpler, and the number of items players need to remember is also within the “7±2” range</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not only reflected in the number of skills. RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games bring Miller’s Law into full play. As a typical multi-threaded game, RTS requires players to control the overall situation and each “chunk”. According to research, in <em>StarCraft</em>, except for some professionally trained professional players, most ordinary players can only take care of six or seven game events at the same time, which has the same effect as Miller’s Law. These include back-end resource development, advance team reconnaissance, containment, frontal force attack, defense, etc., but no matter how the player operates, it is within the scope of Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F6ae8d06d-5b91-466c-b370-cefe8f031c9b.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Not to mention other events, attack alone can be divided into single-line and multi-line, ground-to-ground and ground-to-air</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, when designing, designers will also consider the design of multi-threading more or less: too few threads will make the game too simple and lack depth; too many threads will greatly increase the difficulty of the game.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many places that reflect this “magical 7”: the number of displays in the status bar and toolbar, the menu items on the UI, the number of key NPCs in the plot… These should basically fall within the range of “7±2”, otherwise, there will be a greater risk of causing players to obtain information and memory burden.</p>
<h2 id="2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding"><a href="#2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding"></a>2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding</h2><p>Miller’s research is not only on the “number 7”, but also on the concept of chunks and our ability to process memory information.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone will encounter the problem of too many APPs when using mobile phones. Only by classifying them into groups and naming each group correctly can the mobile phone desktop look clean. In fact, this is a daily manifestation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>When the amount of information is indeed excessive and cannot be simply and rudely compressed, it is an excellent method to match related information to different information units to form chunks. At this time, the component block replaces a single APP as the memory unit. As long as the number of chunks does not exceed “7±2”, it can easily and effectively help users process and understand information, so that they can quickly identify the content of interest, and “expand” the user’s memory span to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In games, this method has also been widely practiced.</p>
<p>In the UI design of FPS games, the current gun information, the number of bullets, the backup gun, and the throwing object information belong to the same type of elements. They are often grouped together as a whole and displayed at the bottom left or bottom right of the screen at the same time, reducing the burden on the player’s brain: just glance in one direction to get all the relevant information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F4d468337-a631-4693-8013-cedd3deed5c3.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>A large amount of information does not appear individually, but is grouped into “chunks” and regarded as a unit</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the character information (including health, skills, mechanism values, etc.) in ACT games also has the same characteristics, so it is often put together.</p>
<p>Not only the UI, but the backpack systems of many games also reflect this “classification” wisdom. Take the classic sandbox game <em>Minecraft</em> as an example. Its backpack has a one-click sorting function. As long as the player presses the corresponding button, the items will be automatically arranged according to the category; if you want to store, the chest interface also has a classification button with similar functions. After that, when players observe the backpack interface, they are no longer looking around like “headless flies”, but looking for the category first, and then looking for the corresponding item. The difficulty of obtaining information before and after sorting the backpack is very different, which also reflects the importance of chunks in Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fc34eafb5-4c13-4570-b2aa-6125b3b612a7.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience"><a href="#3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience"></a>3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience</h2><p>Another major method derived from Miller’s Law is: step-by-step design to reduce information density and optimize user experience. In fact, we are practicing the theory of distribution operations every day. Imagine what the user experience would be like if the food delivery APP put ordering, placing an order, filling in the address, and payment on the same interface? What if the mobile bank stuffed the key steps of transfer such as filling in information, obtaining a verification code, and identity confirmation all to the user? Step-by-step design has penetrated into all aspects of our daily life. Although it looks simple, its role cannot be underestimated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fa391b6cf-9e72-4132-bf44-5afbdb3e8221.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Step-by-step design of ordering in food delivery APP</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Game operations often encounter scenarios with particularly large amounts of information or complex business. Usually in game design, designers will first sort out the game process, and then process the corresponding information step by step, thereby reducing the impatient emotions brought to players by excessive information content in a single step, allowing players to immerse themselves in the current operation in each step.</p>
<p>The closest thing to step-by-step design in the game is the novice tutorial, because a large amount of information about the operation must be displayed to a person with no experience at all. At this time, how to achieve “clear explanation” while being “easy to understand” and “not discouraging” is the top priority of novice tutorial design.</p>
<p>At present, the novice tutorials of many games have implemented Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching form, most novice tutorials break down the teaching content into small pieces, and only teach one content at a time, such as operation methods, game rules, task goals, etc., to avoid confusion for new players; in terms of the amount of content, although the types and focus of various game operations are different, the number of key teaching nodes in many novice tutorials falls exactly within the range of “7±2”. This is not a coincidence, but an imperceptible manifestation of Miller’s Law in design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F97dc54e3-fff5-4844-a55f-f6d29f2216ba.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Destiny 2”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in <em>Destiny 2</em>, although its novice tutorial lasts nearly half an hour, there are actually only a few key teaching points, many of which are already familiar to players (such as movement, jumping, use of firearms, etc.). The information density can be said to be quite low, which also reflects that <em>Destiny 2</em> is not a very hardcore FPS game. At the same time, the 8 teaching points also fall within the range of Miller’s Law “7±2”, and the overall rhythm and the player’s memory burden have been fully optimized.</p>
<p>And <em>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em> obviously also conforms to this rule: step-by-step teaching, and the number is limited to the range of “7±2”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F55ef574a-0e2f-44ec-97b4-9ec67422e76a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, inserting plots in the novice tutorial is not only an excellent way to introduce the game world view and explain the background, but also has the effect of reducing information density, allowing users to slowly absorb teaching knowledge and giving players time to remember and digest. This is also why many games like to use the perspective of the protagonist to advance the plot while killing enemies, and embed novice tutorials in the plot.</p>
<p>Of course, not only novice tutorials, but many puzzle game level designs also adopt step-by-step design. At this time, players will no longer advance the level linearly, but obtain information and resources in a step-by-step manner, reflecting the core of puzzle games: information acquisition and information use. And Miller’s Law solves the user experience problem during information acquisition.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic puzzle game <em>Rusty Lake: Paradise</em>, players can see many shadows of step-by-step design. From the perspective of the entire game, its plot process is divided into ten levels (that is, ten disasters), and this division optimizes the user’s plot intake experience; from the perspective of a single level, different information is placed in different small scenes, but the amount of information in each scene is very small, which is also a decrease in information density, which helps to reduce the information collection burden of players, and uses the layout of each small scene to make players form associations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F140e2074-a949-4867-8e4b-6fc11d834d22.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The smallest unit of “Rusty Lake: Paradise”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It can be seen that due to the particularity of puzzle games, the amount of information cannot be controlled within the range of “7±2”, and at this time, step-by-step design is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The application of Miller’s Law in design is mainly to solve the user memory problem caused by information blocks. Reasonable information layout and information processing can greatly improve the user’s reading and memory of information. In game design, following Miller’s Law can control the complexity and difficulty of the game, improve the playability and user experience of the game; at the same time, it can also help new players better understand and master the game rules and gameplay.</p>
<p>Game designers can practice Miller’s Law by controlling the number and combination of game rules, interface elements, etc., designing game content step by step, and adopting interactive teaching methods, so as to create a simpler and easier-to-understand game experience, and improve the user satisfaction and reputation of the game. However, Miller’s Law should also be used flexibly, and do not misuse the “magical 7” to make unnecessary restrictions on the design. Analyzing specific situations is the best policy for design.</p>
