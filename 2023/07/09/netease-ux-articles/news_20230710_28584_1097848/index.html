<h2 id="1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="1. The Necessity of Game Localization"></a>1. The Necessity of Game Localization</h2><p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is one of the most active and growing game markets in the world in recent years. More and more developers are adopting different strategies to localize their video games into Arabic, undoubtedly seeing the huge growth potential here.</p>
<p>The localization of a game, especially in markets with good demand fit, a large player base, and weak English proficiency, can have a huge impact. According to statistics, the sales of <em>Gremlins, Inc.</em> increased eightfold within just three months of the release of the Simplified Chinese version, and it became the best-selling language version of the game, accounting for 31% of total sales. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fb55812ae-12f0-49b4-8674-f1558151a259.png/size/" alt="Gremlins, Inc. Sales Data"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Under such market appeal, many production teams will choose to test the waters first and localize part of the game content into Arabic. A more common approach is to start with dubbing, using standard language or dialects for dubbing or subtitles.</p>
<p>However, in the absence of specific research on local player needs and localization expectations, blind action may have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s <em>The Division 2</em> (2019) had a failed dubbing attempt. The game used the Syrian dialect for voice-overs and cutscenes. After Ubisoft released the game trailer, the Arab gaming community expressed dissatisfaction with the Syrian dialect in the game, which forced Ubisoft to change the game language to Modern Standard Arabic. This choice not only cost Ubisoft extra money to re-localize, but also increased the additional time cost.</p>
<p>When deciding to make a localized version, developers will weigh factors such as time, cost, and expectations for the target market. These factors determine the strategy to start the game localization and which game content will be localized into the target language. The currently existing game localization strategies can be divided into four main categories: zero localization, printed materials, partial localization, and full localization.</p>
<p>For example, for some immersive RPG games, especially when the screen contains important interactive elements, it is helpful to partially localize the subtitles for players who do not understand the source language. </p>

<h2 id="2-Existing-Localization-Strategies-in-the-Middle-East-Market"><a href="#2-Existing-Localization-Strategies-in-the-Middle-East-Market" class="headerlink" title="2. Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market"></a>2. Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market</h2><p>When it comes to selling games in the target market, video games with zero localization dominate the Arab market because manufacturers believe that Arabic-speaking players who can speak English will buy games in the source language, so they can get some extra sales without investing in the localization process.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (2018) and <em>NBA2K20</em> (2019), which are popular in the Middle East, the lack of this translation has paved the way for the emergence of Arabic fan localization. Fans in the Middle East translate their favorite games accordingly or provide guides with Arabic commentary or subtitles on YouTube. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fccbe643b-2142-45aa-a8b1-ef44687bd471.png/size/" alt="Red Dead Redemption Arabic Guide on Youtube"></p>

<p>In the mid-1990s, packaging and manual localization prevailed in the Arab game market. This part of the localization requires translating a game’s packaging and player’s manual. This level of localization is defined as “market-driven localization”, which also includes the localization of the game’s e-store introduction, website, and installation wizard. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F13b4de80-debe-440a-8f97-b69ad2c80ad9.png/size/" alt="FIFA 1995 Arabic Packaging and Manual"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In-game localization strategies also include partial and full localization. Partial localization includes providing translations of in-game text, such as user interface (UI), and subtitles for animations and audio. Full localization involves localizing all game content into the target language, including translating packaging, manuals, and user interfaces, as well as dubbing audio files and illustrations. The following figure counts the number of games (142 in total) that have been localized into Arabic using different strategies between 2005 and 2020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2c3d9454-5ad7-4066-a1b7-0498e4834c83.png/size/" alt="Number of Games Localized into Arabic 2005-2020"></p>

<p><em>Number of Games Localized into Arabic from 2005 to 2020</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at some examples of Arabic products that use various localization strategies and the different effects they bring.</p>
<h3 id="User-Interface-and-Subtitles"><a href="#User-Interface-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="User Interface and Subtitles"></a>User Interface and Subtitles</h3><p>The core of partial localization lies in localizing the in-game text and converting the subtitles of voice-overs and cutscenes into the target language. Most companies that want to release games in the Arab region adopt this partial localization. Successful examples include <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015), <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> (2016), <em>Resident Evil 7</em> (2017), <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> (2018), <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> (2019), and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> (2020) - all of which have been well received by Arab players. According to data surveys, about 48% of these games use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F95963434-8546-4857-a4fa-15128be3cd4a.png/size/" alt="Rise of the Tomb Raider Arabic Version"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>However, due to the particularity of Arabic, excessively long subtitles will affect the playability of the game and have a negative impact on the immersion of the game. In this case, instead of enjoying the graphics and gameplay, players may spend more time reading the subtitles. In this regard, including low-quality subtitles may have a negative impact on players’ understanding and overall gaming experience. Due to the lack of experience and historical case studies on Arabic subtitles, there is a lack of reference templates and experience for Arabic subtitles in games, which makes it difficult for game companies and localizers to adjust the game during the actual operation.</p>
<p>The Arabic subtitles in <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015) used MSA to localize into Arabic; however, the excessively small font size and long subtitles to fit the screen have adversely affected the intelligibility of the game and the introduction of the entire storyline. Some subtitles in the game contain 8 sentences and strings of more than 200 characters, which is quite lengthy. So, the tenacious Arabic players, in order to continue playing the game, began to make their own comfortable-looking font replacement Mods and shared them on online forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fb1d1aefd-e2c5-44b4-a9eb-3e75e7564ae1.png/size/" alt="The Witcher 3 Arabic Font Mod"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《The Witcher 3》 Arabic Font Mod</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>Some games only provide localization services for the user interface. This approach only involves minimal localization so that players who do not speak the game’s source language can launch the game and customize the settings according to their preferences. Games that adopt this localization strategy include <em>Goat Simulator</em> (2014) and <em>Squad</em> (2015). Manufacturers may usually adopt this method in order to compress the localization budget and improve the release efficiency, mainly to test the acceptance of the game in specific regions, without investing a lot of money and additional development time in a more in-depth localization process.</p>
<p>There are also some situations where the game code itself does not support providing subtitles for dialogues; the game itself does not rely on dialogues to build the game experience, etc. For example, <em>The Bridge</em> (2013) and <em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em> (2019) can both be played smoothly in Arabic at this level of localization. In this case, Arabic players can access all linguistic content (in-game text, such as menus and instructions) in Arabic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F27ecb01c-60ba-4b41-a9e8-31323225176f.png/size/" alt="Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey Arabic UI"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey》 Arabic UI</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>The practice of localizing only subtitles is not uncommon in the Arab video game market - only providing subtitles for the game’s voice-overs and cutscenes, that is, without localizing the user interface or in-game text. It is often used in games that rely heavily on dialogue, such as <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2014, 2015, 2017) and <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> (2016).</p>
<p>However, in some cases, technical issues in the game code or game engine prevent developers from providing Arabic localization with subtitles. Ubisoft Middle East localization director Malek Teffaha also said: “[Subtitles] are a matter of budget and game engine limitations. In our engine, support for Arabic text direction and fonts is not yet complete.” When designing games, consideration should be given to localizing the interface into other languages; developers should be prepared to handle game code in different languages from the beginning.</p>
<p>Localization is often an aspect that is easily overlooked during the game development process, and the development team may also lack knowledge of certain language characteristics, so they develop a game code whose interface may not fully support them.</p>
<p>For players who do not understand the game’s source language, the ‘subtitles only’ approach is problematic. For example, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> lacks localized instructions and in-game ‘tips’. The following figure is taken from the loading screen of <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>. Along the bottom of the screen, the game writes a tip for players: “If you forget how to use something in the game, you can use the Know-It-All app to get some tips and tricks at any time.” However, many Arabic players cannot get useful information through this prompt due to language barriers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F07a4802a-86b9-4c2f-b60f-2ade91ac9bb8.png/size/" alt="Watch Dogs 2 Loading Screen"></p>

<p>The upper left corner of the figure below shows instructions on how to play the game (the function of the joystick buttons), explaining how to open the equipment wheel’ or ‘how to sprint’. These actions are crucial to the gameplay, and players who cannot read the source language can only learn these through constant trial and error. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Between 2005 and 2020, 142 games have been localized into Arabic. Before 2000, localized games were not common. However, with the surge in the number of Arab gamers, major manufacturers have realized the huge potential of this market in the past 15 years and have begun to increase the number of Arabic localized games.</p>
<p>Choosing the level of full localization requires a lot of technical and working time, so the cost is high and time-consuming. Therefore, products usually adopt different levels of localization strategies to find a cost-effective localization route that is suitable for their own product characteristics, skillfully allowing players to understand and smoothly experience the game, thereby opening a window to overseas target users.</p>
