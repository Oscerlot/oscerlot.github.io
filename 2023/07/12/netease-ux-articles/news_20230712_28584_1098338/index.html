<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may have had the following experiences: during an exam, you can clearly remember various key points and details, but after the exam, these details become blurred in your mind; you fill out a quiz in an H5, but are told to forward and share it to see the results; a variety show is about to announce the promotion results, but suddenly a commercial break appears, and you have to wait patiently for the commercial to finish before watching the results.</p>
<p>All of these cases are related to a psychological effect called the “Zeigarnik Effect,” and this theory is also applied to the experience design in the game field. This article will introduce the Zeigarnik Effect and its application examples in the game field, and discuss how designers can use the Zeigarnik Effect to attract players’ attention and make them “unable to stop.”</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive"><a href="#1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive"></a>1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive</h2><p>The Zeigarnik Effect states that humans have a drive to do things from beginning to end, and they have a strong motivation to complete unfinished tasks, and they focus more attention on these unfinished tasks. The reason why people forget completed work is because the motivation to complete it has been satisfied; if the work is not yet completed, the same motivation will make them have a deep impression of it, and their attention will tend to focus on it. Unfinished tasks that are interrupted midway are not only easy to recall, but also have a tendency to continue to be completed after other work has been done.</p>
<p>The reason why many games are addictive can be explained by the Zeigarnik Effect. Take <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> as an example. After the player determines a certain unactivated tower as the main goal, although they will deviate from the route to experience a lot of extra content (such as opening shrines, finding Korok seeds, and clearing enemy strongholds), they will generally continue to move towards the main goal.</p>
<p>When the player sets the destination at the starting point, the desire to complete has already been generated. Before the desire to complete this matter is satisfied, no matter what is done along the way, the player will still retain part of their attention on the main goal. Therefore, the rich exploration content along the way will not affect the basic goal. At the same time, the completion drive supports the player to continue moving forward until they reach the main goal. In this process, the Zeigarnik Effect plays a great role. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F856bbb76-9f47-4a2f-bec1-d57d275df169.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《The Legend of Zelda》: The content between one starting point and another tower is very rich, but it will not affect the player’s final arrival at the main goal.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Since the Zeigarnik Effect can effectively focus people’s attention on specific events and spontaneously generate a strong completion drive, designers can fully utilize this effect to make players’ intentions more easily aligned with design goals. Next, we will introduce some design methods and points to note that allow the Zeigarnik Effect to work.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive"><a href="#2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive"></a>2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive</h2><h3 id="Visualized-Progress-Incentive"><a href="#Visualized-Progress-Incentive" class="headerlink" title="Visualized Progress Incentive"></a>Visualized Progress Incentive</h3><p>Providing clear and transparent progress prompts can make players aware of their current completed progress and the remaining amount of tasks to be completed. The certainty brought by this transparent progress information can make players more confident in the task process, thereby having a higher completion drive. There are many ways to express progress information, and visualizing progress information is an efficient and widely used way of conveying information.</p>
<p>For example, in the 3D platform jumping game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, at the beginning of each level, players are told the number of Moons needed to pass the level, and the target number of Moons and the number currently obtained are clearly marked in the HUD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Ff50cd137-505f-49df-8d0e-27744e0a7584.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Super Mario Odyssey》 In-game HUD: How many more Moons the player needs to collect is clearly marked.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In some special situations, clear progress information may play a stronger positive encouraging role. <em>Cuphead</em> is a 2D platform jumping shooting game known for its high difficulty. Its high challenge not only does not discourage a large number of players, but players may even become more frustrated and even addicted in the process of continuous challenge failures, and some design details in the game play a boosting role. For example, the settlement interface where players fail the challenge in the game will display the level position reached in this round, allowing players to clearly see the completed level progress and the remaining level progress. In the boss level, they can also see the boss stage markers that have the same function as milestones, which can effectively encourage players to re-challenge this level; especially when the player is close to the finish line, they will have a stronger completion drive.</p>
<p>The following is the failure interface of <em>Cuphead</em> (the top is the original interface, the bottom is the interface without the level progress bar): Imagine if you see the interface below every time you fail, is it easier to lose your goal and even give up the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F58abcf77-ffd1-43e1-a133-03cfe6854128.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F24ef2fbc-9d2f-471d-97fc-eb23a4d043dc.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, the expression of progress information can also try to use interesting gameplay for packaging. <em>The Tiny Bang Story</em> is a level-based puzzle game with item finding and collection as the main gameplay. Jigsaw puzzles are a kind of level collection in the game. At the end of each level, players will enter a jigsaw puzzle mini-game interface. Each level can get fragments and complete part of the jigsaw puzzle by themselves. When the jigsaw puzzle is completely completed, the game is cleared. The developer uses the jigsaw puzzle gameplay combined with the game’s worldview to package the game progress in an interesting way. Each completed jigsaw puzzle part corresponds to the level map that has just passed. Players can roughly judge the game progress through the area of the unfinished jigsaw puzzle. This kind of level ending interface that is both ritualistic and interesting can leave a deeper impression. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F7e023bba-40d7-4753-8223-cebcfa2b1e66.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks"><a href="#Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks"></a>Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks</h3><p>To make it easier for players to advance the task flow, large tasks can be broken down into small tasks. This design will reduce the perceived workload of players and make them more likely to put in effort. The character creation process of <em>Biomutant</em> is relatively complicated. If all functions are arranged in the same interface by switching tabs, it may cause certain pressure on players. Therefore, in the game, these pre-settings are divided into several small steps, allowing players to choose to focus on the content of the current page or directly generate it randomly, so that it is not easy to think that these processes are too cumbersome and leave a bad experience impression. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F9b531f86-a440-4d93-a5d4-0c7be49fbbab.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F934d4d94-e200-4621-825d-b5d7e7544338.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Biomutant》 Character creation process (the picture below is an early real machine demonstration screen, you can see the clear step progress)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The same design can also be seen in the mandatory feature demonstration process of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. This process briefly shows players several new features of the controller before players officially enter the game. The designer breaks down all new features into five experience steps so that players can focus on experiencing the current feature in turn, rather than feeling overwhelmed by a bunch of new features and ending the experience hastily. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F54882e2b-a03a-4ade-b8ea-303036d7f819.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, there is a casual gameplay called Bamboo Strike Challenge. Players need to quickly press the buttons in sequence according to the button sequence instructions on the screen to complete the bamboo cutting. The condition for a successful challenge is that the player quickly presses 7 buttons in sequence. In this challenge task, the player’s completion motivation is very clear, but it is difficult to master the clicking sequence of these seven buttons at once and press them quickly. The player’s completion drive is likely to be suppressed in frustration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge is generally divided into three gradual steps. In the first step, players only need to complete the bamboo cutting of three buttons, which is very simple; the second step adds two button presses on the basis of the first step. Players have basically mastered the method of quickly pressing five buttons here, and have already satisfied the desire to complete the first two steps; the third step is based on the second step. Two more buttons are added on the basis of the step. This step is very challenging, but because of the practice in the first two steps, players will be more likely to master the skills. At the same time, because they are close to completing the goal, the player’s motivation to complete will be stronger, and the possibility of persisting in completing the challenge will be higher. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F6e31da2e-3a82-46dc-b93e-7dc1b944a996.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Artificial-Advancement-Effect"><a href="#Artificial-Advancement-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Advancement Effect"></a>Artificial Advancement Effect</h3><p>To better stimulate the player’s completion drive, designers can also try to let players regard the task as “unfinished” rather than “not started”. Here, another psychological term that is often mentioned along with the Zeigarnik Effect is introduced - the Artificial Advancement Effect. The Artificial Advancement Effect is also related to strengthening the drive for action. This theory states that if a person is artificially provided with some progress towards achieving a goal, that person will be more motivated to complete the goal.</p>
<p>A classic example is the car wash membership card experiment. In the experiment, researchers distributed two types of cards with stamps to exchange for free car wash opportunities, but one of them had eight empty stamp spaces, and the other had two stamped spaces and eight empty stamp spaces. Theoretically speaking, both types of cards need to collect 8 more stamps to get a car wash opportunity. But after nine months, 19% of those with the first type of card successfully redeemed the car wash opportunity, while as many as 34% of the latter redeemed the car wash opportunity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F3a29f546-5ee6-4042-9073-1f16a33f4836.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the “Celestial Weaver” appearance extraction interface of <em>Revelation M</em>, players can get a free extraction opportunity every day. We can try to analyze this reward distribution method from the perspective of the Zeigarnik Effect: First, this extraction opportunity breaks the player’s impression of the current cycle of extraction progress as “not started”. Secondly, the progress reward of the prize pool becomes a state of “unfinished”, thereby stimulating the player’s desire and drive to complete the progress reward. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fa2ad06dc-2315-4104-a615-6fb1db29fa47.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Goal-Gradient-Effect"><a href="#Goal-Gradient-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Goal Gradient Effect"></a>Goal Gradient Effect</h3><p>In addition, the psychological effect closely related to the Zeigarnik Effect is the Goal Gradient Effect. Using the Goal Gradient Effect can also better mobilize the player’s completion drive. The Goal Gradient Effect means that when a person is close to the goal, the drive for action will be stronger. At this time, the manifestation of the enhanced drive for action is to accelerate their own actions in order to reach the goal faster, and to be willing to spend more costs to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>The application of the Goal Gradient Effect on the interface is not uncommon. The more familiar case should be the progress bars of various APPs that are stuck at 99% and difficult to continue. The first 99% is accumulated effortlessly. Compared with the so-called 99% sunk cost, users care more about the last 1% that seems to be within reach. This “fake” progress bar can make users willing to invest more time and effectively enhance users’ willingness to continue waiting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F29ffea0e-0d7e-4f70-833c-63c0a442d729.png/size/"></p>
<p>In some games, design details can be seen where designers use progress prompts to enhance players’ drive for action. For example, in the physics-based puzzle game <em>World of Goo</em>, every time the player builds, if they are closer to the end pipe opening, it will trigger a “xx meters left” text feedback. This progress prompt will make the player’s completion drive stronger the closer they get to the pipe opening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F2a1fccfc-b2ad-4ef4-ac40-faeced9b069e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《World of Goo》 Distance prompt</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is a similar design in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. The player’s rank promotion is represented by a circular progress bar and an iconized level to express the player’s current level and the progress of this level. In addition, the estimated time cost required for promotion is also specially marked. When the completion cost is within the player’s acceptable range, it is easier to stimulate their completion drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fd0706694-f304-47a0-ad29-fa7824668141.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Positive-Feedback"><a href="#Positive-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Positive Feedback"></a>Positive Feedback</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the Zeigarnik Effect achieves the effect of deepening impression and attracting attention through the player’s unfulfilled desire to complete. Although players can obtain a certain amount of mental pleasure through the satisfaction of the desire to complete, designers still need to pay attention to giving players positive feedback at the right time during the task process to avoid leaving an overall negative feeling greater than the positive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F8ba84e12-abc1-4d1f-818f-9190d8fa5cf4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2》 The positive feedback when obtaining Battle Pass tokens is very sufficient</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In summary, experience design can utilize visualized progress incentives, task decomposition, the Artificial Advancement Effect, the Goal Gradient Effect, and appropriate positive feedback, etc., to make the Zeigarnik Effect play a better role. But no matter what the designer does, it is to guide the player to more easily reach agreement with the design goal and help the player better complete each game goal. The fundamental purpose is always to allow players to have a better gaming experience.</p>
