<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230717/28584_1099119.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For game players or poetry readers, games and poetry are not conventionally compatible art forms.</p>
<p>After all, most poetry expresses serious themes, often involving poets’ reflections on life, death, emotions, and landscapes, or their deepest cries and expressions. Games, on the other hand, seem like a relatively simpler, more direct form of entertainment.</p>
<p>But from an artistic perspective, games are very much like a melting pot. Whether it’s text or images, static or dynamic, once melted into the game, its artistic form becomes multi-dimensional, and its expression becomes diverse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the former, an ancient and solitary art, is revitalized by merging with a new and lively art form.</p>
<h2 id="1-Poetry-and-Games"><a href="#1-Poetry-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Poetry and Games"></a>1. Poetry and Games</h2><p>Although they are very different fields, in some ways, isn’t writing poetry a kind of word game? Burying meaning, arranging and rhyming, exquisite deliberation, design, and revision, mirrors the process of creating a game.</p>
<p>Similarly, games can be created and expressed in a poetic way.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Royal Festival Hall in London hosted an exhibition by the National Poetry Library called “Poetry Games”. In the exhibition, people could create their own poems through block games. Murray, the organizer of the exhibition, hoped to attract people who are not very fond of entering the poetry library but are familiar with the language of games, to weaken the image of poetry as obscure and difficult to understand in textbooks. People may simply be playing games, and then suddenly burst into inspiration, find that poetry is actually very interesting, and unconsciously write down words. He also mentioned that now all art forms are learning from games, and poetry should do the same.</p>
<p>Indeed, various art forms are already on the road to integration with games.</p>
<p>So when we look at it from the other side, the end of the road, many games themselves are already embedded with rich poetry and poetic language. In <em>Fallout</em>, if the player hacks the terminal of the ghoul Tulip, they can read John Milton’s 17th-century British epic <em>Paradise Lost</em>. In <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, there are more than 73 poems, songs, and letters, which have even been compiled into a website system for enthusiasts to consult. It can be described as a literary and poetic feast originating from the game.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the game world of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, an epic poem called “Loveless” tells the story of three men searching for the legendary “Gift of the Goddess”. This poem has made several cameos in the game’s compilation and was later adapted into a musical stage play. There is also a street named after it in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to directly presenting complete poems, many games have also found other ways to integrate poetry. For example, in the game <em>Wayfinder</em>, players need to control characters to wander in a beautiful world full of poetry, collect fragmented words, and finally compile them into complete fragments to create a poem about the land the protagonist is exploring. Another example is a fantasy adventure game called <em>Elegy for a Dead World</em>, which takes players into landscapes inspired by the poems of Shelley, Keats, and Byron, and then guides them to write directly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230717/b2d0d32f-4db1-4935-891c-bf068657c81a.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Elegy for a Dead World》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A more direct creation is Ross Sutherland, the producer of <em>Street Fighter II</em>, who released original sonnets based on Street Fighter on National Poetry Day, depicting and creating a new mythical world composed of 12 heroes from Street Fighter.</p>
<p>Therefore, although niche, cultural art forms such as poetry have quietly infiltrated the game content production process in a quiet and special way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry"><a href="#2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry" class="headerlink" title="2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry"></a>2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry</h2><p>If we call the combination of poetry and games a bold fusion, then the localization of poetry in games is like a kind mother who has to tolerate the waywardness of children.</p>
<p>When faced with the expressive desire of poetry in games and its hidden cultural heritage, how to retain the original meaning and emotion of the poem, reflect the rhythm and language style of the poem, and also consider the target language, cultural characteristics, and the acceptance of the audience, is a challenge that every worker in the localization process needs to think deeply about and overcome.</p>
<p>Taking <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> mentioned above as an example, the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game has become an ancient legendary poem widely sung in the game’s story background with its smooth rhythm and simple arrangement. Some clumsy and absurd jokes and names have been specially added to the simple chanting rhythm to highlight how ridiculous it is that a rookie alchemist obtained a potion that made him smart in a pure accident.</p>
<p>Although the English version of the “Song of the Alchemists” uses simple words, the rhythm is interlocking. It starts with end rhyme, interestingly unfolding the beginning of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When King Maraneon’s alchemist had to leave his station</p>
<p>After a laboratory experiment that yielded detonation,</p>
<p>The word went out that the King did want</p>
<p>A new savant</p>
<p>To mix his potions and brews.</p>
<p>But he declared he would only choose</p>
<p>A fellow who knew the tricks and the tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation uses words such as “开除 (kāi chú - fired)”, “缘故 (yuán gù - reason)”, and “奴仆 (nú pú - servant)” to retain the pronunciation of “brews” and “choose” in English, completing the end rhyme and promoting the easy-to-sing characteristic of this poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>国王马兰尼恩的炼金术士被<strong>开除</strong></p>
<p>由于他的实验室爆炸了的<strong>缘故</strong></p>
<p>国王诏令要新的<strong>奴仆</strong></p>
<p>为他配置药水和药物</p>
<p>但他只要一个人</p>
<p>能熟练掌握炼金术的技巧和工具的用途</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the more difficult combination of alliteration + end rhyme, Chinese loses some of its color. For example, in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much deliberation, discussions, and debates,</p>
<p>The King picked two well-learned candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text has both alliteration of “deliberation, discussions, and debates” and the echo of end rhyme of “debates and candidates”. The Chinese version can only be translated literally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>通过大量的考虑、讨论、辩争</p>
<p>国王最后选了两位有才的候选人</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is related to the characteristics of the language itself. It is indeed difficult for Chinese to achieve both meaning, alliteration, and end rhyme, and to be fluent and rhythmic. However, the use of written language like “通过大量的考虑 (tōng guò dà liàng de kǎo lǜ - through a lot of consideration)” in poetry seems abrupt and awkward. Therefore, from the perspective of whether it conforms to the characteristics of “easy to sing”, “narrative”, “rhythm” and “teasing” of the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game, although this Chinese localized text has some processing that fits the original text, it has not been further scrutinized.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the game <em>The Witcher 3</em>, players can also come into contact with many ancient poems, including original poems based on the game’s background story, as well as excellent works from the Middle Ages. For example, the quote from the Ladies of the Wood in the game is taken from the original text of Act 1, Scene 3 of <em>Macbeth</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land, thus do go about, about: thrice to thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text is precise and powerful, not only in rhythm, but also in syllables and format.</p>
<p>For example, “Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land” is a perfect introductory sentence in terms of format, with both smooth syllable arrangement and rhythmic echo. Moreover, “thrice”, “thine”, “mine” and “nine” appear alternately, making the rhythm of the poem like undulating peaks, giving readers a repeated and enjoyable singing.</p>
<p>Looking at the text alone, players or readers may find it difficult to understand. But in connection with the image of the Ladies of the Wood in the game, the mystery of this text can be broken.</p>
<p>There are three Ladies of the Wood, namely Weavess, Brewess, and Whispess, and their powerful magic comes from the land. For the local residents, they are both gods to rely on and demons that take lives. On the one hand, the Ladies of the Wood reward devout believers who offer sacrifices, eliminate the disasters and difficulties they face, and help the villagers through difficult times; on the other hand, they demand absolute obedience from believers and occasionally require villagers to sacrifice their hair, ears, or even their children.</p>
<p>Moreover, not everyone can see the three ladies: most people can only participate in the dinner at the campfire at the foot of the mountain, and the ladies will select beautiful guests who satisfy them from these people, usually three, and then these young men and women will go up to the mountain to spend the night with them. When these three young men and women come back, they never mention what happened at the night meeting, and even forget their past, just full of joy, as if they were reborn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230717/09b586db-7b77-4bde-8fef-0dffe49440ce.png"></p>
<p>With the background story of the game in mind, in the existing translations, we can read Zhu Shenghao’s translation of this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>沧海高山弹指地，朝飞暮返害人命，</p>
<p>姐三巡，妹三巡，三三九转蛊方成。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation also starts with a similar syllable arrangement of “三姐妹，手牵手 (sān jiě mèi, shǒu qiān shǒu - three sisters, hand in hand)”, successfully continuing the jingle-like introduction of the original text. At the same time, the translation also shows the powerful and dialectical abilities of the three sisters: they can both overturn the world and possibly harm people’s lives. In addition to the end rhyme of “地 (dì - land)” and “命 (mìng - life)”, the translation cleverly replaces the “you” and “me” of the original text with “姐三巡，妹三巡 (jiě sān xún, mèi sān xún - sister three rounds, sister three rounds)”, which not only conforms to the meaning of the original text, but also achieves rhyme again and reproduces the poetic and chanting sense.</p>
<p>However, the actual Chinese localization of <em>The Witcher 3</em> game is much inferior to this translation. The traditional Chinese version of the text not only loses the syllable arrangement, but also makes the poem seem like many unordered dancers running around on the stage due to literal translation and the combination of uncommon sentence patterns. There is no rhythm, no music, and no lighting rehearsal, presenting a strange dance performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>老巫妪，三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>穿梭海陆，吓破人胆，如此前进，</p>
<p>三次我，三次你，又三次，总共九。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence “老巫妪，三姐妹 (lǎo wū yù, sān jiě mèi - old crones, three sisters)” is awkward as the opening sentence, and although “手牵手 (shǒu qiān shǒu - hand in hand)” and “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” have sentence structure and end rhyme, the long sentence in the middle has already fragmented the rhythm. “三次我，三次你 (sān cì wǒ, sān cì nǐ - thrice me, thrice you)” is also a completely literal translation. From the perspective of Chinese, readers simply cannot understand the meaning. Similarly, “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” is also like an incomplete sentence, which not only does not conform to Chinese sentence habits, but also fails to express any meaning. Even after reading the whole text, it does not help to understand the image and status of the Ladies of the Wood in the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games"><a href="#3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games"></a>3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games</h2><p>The translation and localization of poetry and cultural content in games is crucial to the success and market expansion of games. However, this translation and localization also face many challenges, requiring the knowledge base and in-depth understanding of translators and localization teams. In the process of translation and localization, it is necessary to balance the original meaning and cultural differences, and to consider the acceptance of the readers.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality and efficiency of poetry translation and localization, professional translation and localization aids can be used, clear standards can be formulated, and cultural experts can be cooperated with for review and testing.</p>
<p>For example, in the localization process of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, for short but very rhythmic poetry texts, we usually deal with them as English sentences that conform to rhyme and are catchy. For example, the description text of the costume [Spring Snow]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>碎雪浮青叶，风暖春无垠。</p>
<p>(Fragmented snow floats on green leaves, the wind is warm and spring is boundless.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the basis of neat Chinese characters and smooth rhythm, English also uses end rhyme to show a beautiful scene of spring and melting snow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spring comes with the warm breeze, snow melted then appear the leaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, for some poems and classical Chinese texts that introduce the background story, the primary task of localization is not to rhyme and promote its literary nature, but to be easy to understand and break down cultural barriers.</p>
<p>For example, in the <em>Journey to the West</em> series of appearances, the game quotes the original text of <em>Journey to the West</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>混元体正合先天，万劫千番只自然。</p>
<p>(The primordial body is in harmony with nature, and thousands of eons are just natural.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If too much of the artistic conception that Chinese wants to express is retained here, the translation will become extremely lengthy and lose the original form and meaning of the poem. Therefore, after referring to Anthony C. Yu’s authoritative translation, it is handled here as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cosmic being fully fused with nature’s gifts.</p>
<p>Passes with ease through ten thousand toils and tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230717/8d30fbc7-f1be-4e1d-8c39-3d64c3bbde2c.png"></p>
<p>After making trade-offs in the expression of the text and shortening the wording, the words “混元 (hùn yuán - primordial)”, “先天 (xiān tiān - innate)”, and “劫 (jié - eon)” with strong cultural imagery in Chinese poetry are stripped of their mystery, eliminating the unnecessary burden of understanding, expressing the original meaning more directly, and ensuring the neatness and brevity of the sentence structure.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Cultural differences are a wayward and naughty child in the development of various artistic works. It is wanton, slick, and the barriers it forms often hinder the spread of many excellent works.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the continuous expansion of the game market and the trend of globalization, the localization of poetry in games will become a novel and complex topic. Game developers and localization personnel need to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies and trends to meet the needs of players from different countries and cultural backgrounds, break down cultural barriers, and reduce the difficulty of understanding; at the same time, they also need to continue to pay attention to balancing the original meaning and cultural differences, and consider the acceptance of readers to provide a better gaming experience. In this process, the localization team should work closely together and make joint efforts to become a strong communicator and trailblazer for players in the game world.</p>
