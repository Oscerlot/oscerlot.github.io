<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the era of rapid development of information technology and globalization, as the influence of games on the economy and society continues to increase, it is also increasingly changing the composition of the culture and entertainment industries. Under this premise, esports has emerged as a new competitive mode, gradually becoming one of the most promising fields in the world from its initial niche status. In the emerging South American game market in recent years, the esports industry in Brazil is particularly prosperous. It has hosted many esports exhibitions and attracted investment and sponsorship from many large European and American manufacturers.</p>
<p>Why is esports so popular in Brazil? What are the characteristics of esports development here? What level have Brazilian professional teams reached in this industry? Let’s explore the answers to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends"><a href="#1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends" class="headerlink" title="1. Esports Market and Development Trends"></a>1. Esports Market and Development Trends</h2><p>In 2019, among Brazil’s total population of 210 million, there were 75.7 million game players, close to 36% of the total population.</p>
<p>In 2020, Brazil became the country with the fourth largest number of esports viewers in the world, second only to India, China, and the United States. In addition, in Brazil, the recognition that “esports is a sports event” reached 53%, ranking first in the world. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230724/6d0abd13-429c-4a22-86d8-183aaa707422.png" alt="PwC Data on Brazil&#39;s Esports Market"></p>
<p>According to a survey by PwC, in 2021, the total revenue of video games and esports in Brazil was approximately US$1.4 billion, surpassing Mexico to become the largest market in Latin America. The survey also showed that this figure is expected to reach US$2.8 billion by 2026, which is double in less than five years, accounting for 47.4% of the total revenue of games and esports in Latin America. According to SiGMA statistics, in esports alone, Brazil’s revenue is expected to reach US$16.03 million in 2023 and maintain a compound annual growth rate of 7.75% by 2027.</p>
<p>In terms of game preferences, Newzoo pointed out that although Brazilian users are closer to North American countries, Brazilians prefer shooting, racing, sports, and strategy mobile games. In addition, games with social attributes are also very popular among Latin American players. Therefore, Brazilian teams are also active in esports events of these game types. Brazilian teams can be seen in many major esports projects such as <em>CS:GO</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>.</p>
<p>In the list of the most discussed esports players in the first half of 2022, Brazilian players occupied three of the top ten. In the top ten list of esports clubs, Brazilian clubs occupied four. In 2022, 4,352 Brazilians received a total of US$47 million in prize money from 3,275 competitions, making the country rank seventh in the world in esports profitability.</p>
<h2 id="2-Sports-and-Esports"><a href="#2-Sports-and-Esports" class="headerlink" title="2. Sports and Esports"></a>2. Sports and Esports</h2><p>Speaking of sports, when it comes to Brazil, “football” must be the first word that most people think of. In fact, in addition to football, volleyball is also their strength. The Brazilian women’s volleyball team has always been a strong opponent of the Chinese women’s volleyball team. In other sports, Brazilians have also left their mark. Surfing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and racing are all their strengths. Long-term sports experience has also spawned Brazil’s unique competitive culture, making Brazilians highly receptive to esports projects.</p>
<p>Brazilian players like the two-sided competition mode from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, in this country, esports is also becoming a national sport like football. With no well-known game manufacturers in the country, the Brazilian esports market is still maintaining a healthy development trend. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional sports events were cancelled or suspended, which also allowed esports to develop at a higher speed as an alternative entertainment option. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230724/9ef84033-7b32-4919-ae76-5b3f45fc4c88.jpg" alt="Brazilian Esports Spectators"></p>
<p>In MOBA esports projects such as <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Dota</em>, which require more strategy, Brazilians perform relatively conservatively; while FPS projects, which require more instinct and motor nerves, are the areas where they shine. The glory of the Brazilian team in FPS can be traced back to 2006. At that time, at the World Cyber Games (WCG), Chinese player Sky won the championship of the <em>Warcraft III</em> project for the second time, while the mibr team from Brazil won the championship of the <em>CS 1.6</em> project, creating a glorious moment for Brazil. Until 2022, Brazil also became the only country to win the biggest championship in the three major mainstream tactical shooting games.</p>
<p>The deep integration of Brazilian esports and traditional sports is also relatively rare in other countries. The fans of both sides highly overlap in identity and are very enthusiastic about participation. The culture of traditional sports is introduced into esports by fans, which is fully reflected in last year’s “CS:GO Rio Major”. Brazilian fans brought jerseys, drums and even fireworks to the closed stadium. The stadium was filled with drums, the uniform cheers of fans and the pervasive smoke, making people feel like they were in a crazy Brazilian football stadium. This Major attracted more than 1.5 million people to watch online at the same time, setting a new record for <em>CS:GO</em> competitions. </p>

<p>The enthusiasm of Brazilian football stars for esports has also encouraged more fans. Brazil’s top star Neymar is an FPS expert. <em>PUBG</em> and <em>CS:GO</em> are his favorite game projects. During the <em>CS:GO</em> Rio Major, the football superstar watched the game of the local team FURIA with his friends at home, and cheered for it on his personal social media. <em>PUBG</em>‘s developer KRAFTON did not miss the opportunity to cooperate with Neymar for marketing. In 2022, Neymar officially became the official publicity ambassador of <em>PUBG</em>, and KRAFTON also focused on expanding in the Americas. </p>

<p>Four Brazilian national team players put on the jerseys of the FURIA team (from left: Casemiro, Neymar, Paquetá, Arthur)</p>
<p>Many football clubs in Brazil are also actively participating in the esports industry. The famous club Flamengo is one of them. The team is very famous in Brazil and has the largest number of fans in Brazil, with about 13 million supporters. Its esports club, Flamengo eSports, won the second season of the 2019 CBLoL (<em>League of Legends</em> Brazilian League). In addition, Neymar’s old club, the famous football club Santos, also established its own Santos esports team in July 2018 after three years of cooperation with Dexterity Team.</p>
<p>Thanks to the high integration of football and esports, Brazilian esports teams are also performing well in the <em>FIFA</em> series. In the “FIFA22 eNations Cup” hosted by EA SPORTS, the Brazilian team defeated the Spanish team, the Italian team, and the defending champion French team in one fell swoop to win the championship.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports"><a href="#3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports" class="headerlink" title="3. The Unique Favela Esports"></a>3. The Unique Favela Esports</h2><p>Brazil has always been a country with a large slum population. World Bank data shows that in 2016, the slum population of various cities in Brazil accounted for 15% of the total population. Rio de Janeiro alone has nearly 1.5 million people living in slums, more than 20% of the city’s population. And Brazil’s various slums have always been a major source of competitive talent. Football superstars such as Pelé and Ronaldo grew up in slums.</p>
<p>However, for young people in slums, the threshold of esports is much higher than that of football. The high cost of equipment and internet makes it impossible for many young people who are interested in games to participate in this competition.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Brazil’s slums are also undergoing a digital transformation. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230724/7963c4fb-d957-408a-9849-77476ef68cfb.png" alt="AfroGames Esports Center"></p>
<p>In 2019, with the promotion of the Rio esports charity AfroGames, Brazil established the world’s first esports center in a slum. AfroGames personnel once said, “We realized that only children from the middle and upper classes can afford esports activities. In an esports environment dominated by whites and Asians, AfroGames hopes to help change the status quo of our country by creating such a project”.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also esports clubs like Zero Gravity that only sign low-income young people from slums.</p>
<p>Esports events for young people in slums, such as the Favelas Cup and the Favelas Bowl, also provide opportunities for players who need financial support to win prize money.</p>
<p>The Favelas Cup and Favelas Bowl use the tactical competitive mobile game <em>Free Fire</em> as the competition project, and are open to slum players across Brazil. In the 2020 Favelas Cup, the Central Única das Favelas (CUFA) selected 48 participating teams from the slums of 26 states and federal districts in Brazil, 12 of which entered the finals. The total viewing time of the finals live broadcast reached 290,000 hours.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to reach most of Brazil’s poor communities, provide esports competitions, and encourage children and teenagers to enter the world of technology and innovation,” said Tifanny Nayara, the hostess and anchor of the Favelas Cup. According to her, the Favelas Cup reached “about 100 slums, 200 registered teams and a total of 800 players across the country.” With such widespread dissemination, more and more young people in Brazil hope to change their destiny through esports and get the opportunity to get out of the slums.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In Brazil’s strong esports atmosphere, holding esports events has undoubtedly become an important way for Chinese companies going overseas to expand their influence.</p>
<p>Due to the expensive price of consoles and PCs in the local area, it is obvious that ordinary Brazilian players prefer mobile games. Therefore, many manufacturers choose to use mobile game events as an entry point when deploying the Brazilian market, so that products can quickly enter the vision of the majority of ordinary people and even slum players, and use simple and direct publicity models to trigger the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Discord player community of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we often see players’ expectations and discussions about event activities. Even the Naraka: Bladepoint Pro League (NBPL) for mainland China can attract Brazilian KOLs to live broadcast and explain to players through Twitch.</p>
<p>It is foreseeable that if new overseas games in the future, especially mobile games, are released to the Brazilian market, being able to launch independent South American or Brazilian events will definitely trigger greater enthusiasm from players. The Brazilian players’ aggressive style of play in the competition will also make sports and FPS esports events more enjoyable, further attracting a large esports audience and achieving the diversion and promotion of new games.</p>
