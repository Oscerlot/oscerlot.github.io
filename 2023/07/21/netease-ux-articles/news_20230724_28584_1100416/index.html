What is Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphism is a form of materializing information, also known as realism. A common method is to simulate the style of real-world objects in the interface, pursuing extreme textures and light and shadow, but it can also imitate the user’s familiar operation methods. By materializing information, it improves the efficiency of people’s information understanding, reduces learning costs, and allows users to become familiar with the interface faster.</p>
<p>In games, a large number of skeuomorphic designs can not only present a more refined interface, but also fully mobilize the player’s sense of intimacy and substitution for the game, and the sense of immersion is even better. Therefore, we can often see the application of skeuomorphic design in games. </p>

<li><strong>More intuitive</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By combining information with real objects familiar to players, the presentation of information can be more intuitive and efficient. In <em>Sifu</em>, the game’s worldview and storyline are presented in the form of a collage, allowing players to see the plot at a glance, intuitively view and understand the development of the plot. The whole process is not only in line with the player’s cognition, but also allows players to better substitute into the story presented in front of them, and the information presented in the interface is also very intuitive and clear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F151a2919-d0a2-4471-bd6b-4f55f445e970.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to accept</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On an emotional level, skeuomorphic design makes it easier for players to accept and reduces the player’s learning cost. The design of the sign-in page of <em>Onmyoji: The Card Game</em> is presented in the form of a wishing wind chime. The interface is simple and clear, which not only conforms to the player’s cognition, making it easier for players to complete the sign-in process, but also allows players to complete fortune-telling during the sign-in, making it easier to understand and accept, and improving the sign-in rate from a design perspective. </p>

<h3 id="Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Risks of Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Risks of Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphic design can create a realistic worldview scene in the game, strengthen the atmosphere of the game by simulating objects, and enhance the player’s psychological and emotional substitution. It can be said that skeuomorphic design is one of the preferred methods for game interface design. However, with the continuous enrichment of game interface information, it is difficult to present a large amount of interface information by simply using skeuomorphic design, and it is also difficult to control the layout and hierarchy of information. To a certain extent, it may put the cart before the horse. If used improperly, a clear interaction path cannot be achieved.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?"></a>2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design in games is very beneficial to both the game itself and the players, so we often find such designs in games. Specifically, we can explore from two aspects:</p>
<h3 id="Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface"><a href="#Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Improve the Quality of the Game Interface"></a>Improve the Quality of the Game Interface</h3><p>On the one hand, for the game itself, the design of the skeuomorphic interface can combine the interface with simulated real elements and carry out artistic processing to form an interface design that meets the psychological needs of players. Through skeuomorphic design, it enhances the efficient matching of game interface information. At the same time, the exquisite and artistic design can also enhance the quality of the interface, easily express the theme of the work, and integrate with the game world. </p>

In <em>The Last of Us</em>, the information is connected with the game plot scene, and the map is placed in the player’s audience and scene. This skeuomorphic method is used to enhance the player’s sense of substitution and immersion. </p>

How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?"></a>3. How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design can make the game interface more vivid, but if it is not designed properly, it will also lead to low adaptability, interface discordance, inability to present effective information, and other problems. Therefore, in the process of skeuomorphic design, designers should pay attention to:</p>
<h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality"></a>Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality</h3><p>The skeuomorphic interface design should simulate object elements that are more in line with the player’s psychological cognition, reduce learning costs, and allow players to naturally integrate into the game. In the interface design of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, the game combines the collection of cars with the display form of menus, allowing players to view the collected models by flipping through different menus. Through the element form of the real menu, players are more receptive to the collection of items, and the presentation of the interface is also more vivid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F2b11bb7a-ce70-47a3-8285-1a3d40d35f96.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Gran Turismo 7》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the skill page of <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, the overall interface is designed in the form of stone rubbings, making the overall interface present a heavy effect. Players are like carving on a slate when upgrading skills and equipment, creating a more realistic feeling. In the equipment interface, each weapon has its own exclusive skeuomorphic background. For example, the Blades of Chaos uses the texture of the blade and lava to show the weapon characteristics; while the UI background of the Leviathan Axe shows the frozen attributes. Such a design helps players have a more intuitive and clear understanding of the weapon’s attributes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F9e09de5b-1dd9-48f4-b292-96b85a3becd5.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fe6786c28-1cda-463b-ba63-644b8d2c177a.png/size/"></p>

The yellowish letters and books reflect the mysterious and retro magical colors in the game, and also conform to the background of the times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5bcb1245-f1af-4e3e-b52e-9edf17c88b33.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Hogwarts Legacy》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, a skeuomorphic design that is very consistent with the theme of the game is also selected. In the interface, the form of Atreus’s old books, notebooks, and sketches is used to show the characters, worldview, plot, etc. of the game, which not only fits the theme of the game, but also strengthens the texture and style of the game, rendering the immersive atmosphere of the player’s game. Players are like opening a notepad, reading their own past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fba6c00d9-bb77-4edd-8d9c-ab067b719bed.jpg/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《God of War Ragnarök》 Interface</em></p>

<p><em>The Sinking City</em> also uses the elements of old and damaged notebooks, which fits the theme of detective games. The yellowish notebook shows various information in the game, allowing players to feel full of suspense and enhance the player’s detective experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F475a2e02-5e5f-485e-8478-d6d7fcd13bf4.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Full-Integration-of-Interface-and-Game-Scene"><a href="#Full-Integration-of-Interface-and-Game-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Full Integration of Interface and Game Scene"></a>Full Integration of Interface and Game Scene</h3><p>The skeuomorphic design in the game needs to fully combine the interface information with the game scene to achieve better unity, and even integrate it into the game, so that players will not be detached from the game world. In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the game combines the interface for purchasing items with the scene, allowing players to complete the purchase of items by flipping through the books in the scene, as if they were cowboys in that era, using ancient methods to obtain information about guns, and then selecting and placing orders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5d740af2-4c45-4442-9aef-02dfb470fa89.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Red Dead Redemption 2》 Purchase Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, the interface information is very cleverly combined with the items in the game, and the information prompts are integrated into the scene. The scattering of dandelion text brings a good visual experience to the player. Integrating the interface into the scene cannot appear isolated and abrupt, but should be designed in combination with the current scene, gameplay, etc. of the game, so that this combination is not far-fetched and does not jump out of the scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F397fa426-0c58-407a-86ab-8d66496fd565.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Deeper-Penetration-of-Skeuomorphism"><a href="#Deeper-Penetration-of-Skeuomorphism" class="headerlink" title="Deeper Penetration of Skeuomorphism"></a>Deeper Penetration of Skeuomorphism</h3><p>One of the goals of skeuomorphism is to allow players to continue their cognition and operation methods in life and reduce learning costs. Therefore, in addition to the external decoration of skeuomorphism, the skeuomorphic design of the player’s operation method is its deeper penetration.</p>
<p>In <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, the interface is combined with the electronic screen in the game, connecting information with the scene and placing the interface in the game, making the overall scene produce a more three-dimensional sense of space, and the integration with the scene is also more harmonious and unified. Players seem to be clicking on a control screen, and they are also brought into this virtual world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F2522fed2-e641-48ff-82fc-da55de9d7a8b.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Ratchet &amp; Clank》 Interface</em></p>

<p><em>Dead Space</em> very cleverly integrates the UI with characters and scenes, realizing a deeper exploration of skeuomorphism. The UI interface is completely integrated with the game characters. The character’s health bar in the game can be viewed from the glowing body on the character’s back; while the real-time information of the game is displayed through the character’s hologram in the game. Through the internal UI interface of the scene, the overall game is presented more unified, complete, and real; it also makes the UI, characters, and scenes have a strong connection. Players will not feel detached during the game, and can fully devote themselves to the horror atmosphere. </p>

<h3 id="Use-Skeuomorphism-to-Build-Page-Hierarchy"><a href="#Use-Skeuomorphism-to-Build-Page-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="Use Skeuomorphism to Build Page Hierarchy"></a>Use Skeuomorphism to Build Page Hierarchy</h3><p>In skeuomorphic design, if it is not handled properly, it will cause confusion in the page hierarchy or inability to expand interface information. Therefore, in the design, attention should also be paid to using skeuomorphism to build the hierarchical relationship of the page. For example, in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, cards and notebooks are used to unfold the plot, and the page hierarchy is constructed through the plane relationship, front and back occlusion relationship, color light and shadow of the objects in this skeuomorphic interface, and with the help of book page turning. </p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The skeuomorphic style in the game world has left a deep impression on us. By simulating things and operation methods familiar to players, it can often allow players to quickly accept the game settings and substitute into the entire atmosphere. Skeuomorphic design not only conforms to various whimsical ideas in the game, but also enhances the player’s immersive experience, so it is widely used in many games. If you lack inspiration in design, you may consider referring to various clues in the real world, carrying out skeuomorphic design, and creating a more realistic and friendly interface!</p>
