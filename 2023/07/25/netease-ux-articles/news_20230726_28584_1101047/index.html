<p>If you are a frequent internet user or pay attention to fashion, you should have heard the buzzword “dopamine dressing” recently. In the WeChat index statistics, on a certain day in June alone, the entry for dopamine dressing exceeded 100 million times, with a day-on-day increase of more than 20%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230726/15e3af35-e3ac-472c-a2ea-4e26edd8f02d.png"></p>
<p>For this seemingly mystifying new term, there are various definitions and descriptions on social media. Generally speaking, fashionable outfits that can effectively improve the wearer’s mood is the so-called “dopamine dressing”, which comes from fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released by the brain when a person receives pleasure. Most of the dopamine dressing currently popular online also conveys an optimistic and positive concept to people through simple color psychology. Psychologist Karen Pine said in her book “Mind What You Wear: The Psychology of Fashion” that “what we wear greatly affects how we feel, and even changes our thoughts and judgments.” Some scholars call it “enclothed cognition” and found that our outfits can have symbolic meanings that affect psychology and performance. Therefore, whether you want a colorful, sexy or just comfortable look, the most important thing is to wear clothes that make us feel happy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230726/b2ce3f37-329f-4842-9e77-f84bdb2ab17f.png"></p>
<p>The popularity of dopamine dressing also shows that many people, especially young people, are eager to find their own happiness.</p>
<p>So, in games that also produce a lot of dopamine, what kind of wonderful chemical reaction will the two have?</p>
<p>In fact, in many games, there is such a large group of players with online aesthetics who pay more attention to or like to appreciate the appearance of skins in the game, generally called “appearance-oriented players”; among them, there are also many powerful players who have the hobby of collecting game skins. There are many reasons why they love game skins. On the one hand, the game art caters to their preferences; on the other hand, trying different styles, colors and even skins of different genders in the virtual world can give people a refreshing experience. What attracts them may be to show off their cool fashion special effects, maybe the exaggerated and alternative styles they dare not try in reality, or even the gender-breaking dressing experience.</p>
<p>With the recent popularity of the concept of “dopamine dressing” on social media, people have found that changing clothes and color matching can bring a sense of pleasure, and many players have also shown off their in-game dopamine dressing on social media. Combining the psychological principles of dopamine dressing, we analyze some core points of game dopamine dressing.</p>
<h2 id="1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games"><a href="#1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Dopamine Dressing in Games"></a>1. Dopamine Dressing in Games</h2><h3 id="Color-Matching-is-a-Science"><a href="#Color-Matching-is-a-Science" class="headerlink" title="Color Matching is a Science"></a>Color Matching is a Science</h3><p>The first principle of dopamine dressing is to trigger positive emotions in oneself and those around them by emphasizing the visual impact brought by colors. The core is to make colors bring people a sense of happiness, comfort and confidence.</p>
<p>In terms of color matching, it is more common to stack skins with similar tones to produce a uniform effect. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players can find multiple pleasures and a sense of belonging through fashion and social interaction by dressing in the same color series as other friends. In these dopamine outfits shared by players, black is mysterious, green is natural and fresh, red is joyful and festive, and blue is cold and quiet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230726/9ff10237-4a5b-4f92-ac11-4bca034513b1.png"></p>

<hr>
<p>In addition, although contrasting color combinations are risky, they sometimes have surprising visual effects. For example, in the dopamine dressing shared by <em>Justice Online</em> players, the dark-toned male character fashion and the bright-toned female character walking together also create a wonderful sense of contrast. </p>

<h3 id="Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF"><a href="#Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF" class="headerlink" title="Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF"></a>Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF</h3><p>From the examples in the figure above, it is not difficult to notice that in order to achieve a better visual unity effect, not only can the character’s fashion be matched with the same color series as much as possible, but the scene and accessories are also quite particular. For example, in the black fashion, the player chose the background of the dark night roof. The green outfit is matched with mountain waterfalls and green leaf embellishments. In the red outfit, the character holds Spring Festival couplets to add atmosphere. The blue outfit is on the ice and is accompanied by a “cold” expression. In order to enhance the emotional stimulation effect, many users will add a circle of emoticons of corresponding colors or emotions around the characters to make the picture more vivid and lively, and have an atmosphere. This is especially important when players take screenshots or photos to share.</p>
<h3 id="Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password"><a href="#Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password"></a>Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password</h3><p>This type of video shared by players on social media adopts the common stepping-on-the-beat dressing form of short videos, emphasizing the dynamic effect of the picture, and the picture feeling and emotional stimulation are very direct. With excellent fashion, it is easier to amaze the viewers. Rhythm control is also one of the important elements that determine whether the dopamine dressing video is attractive. Some will match the background music with a strong sense of rhythm to match the picture, and some will use the seven days of the week as the switching node. “One change a day” gives people a stronger sense of substitution. </p>

<h2 id="2-“Dopamine-Dressing”-in-Ancient-Chinese-Art-and-Ancient-Style-Games"><a href="#2-“Dopamine-Dressing”-in-Ancient-Chinese-Art-and-Ancient-Style-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. “Dopamine Dressing” in Ancient Chinese Art and Ancient Style Games"></a>2. “Dopamine Dressing” in Ancient Chinese Art and Ancient Style Games</h2><p>In fact, as early as in ancient China, there were “dopamine” styles in the Terracotta Army, Tang Sancai, and Tang tomb murals. For example, the Terracotta Army, in fact, their original colors when they were just unearthed were very rich. There were 8 colors in total, including red, green, black, white, blue, purple, yellow, and pink, with nearly 20 shades on different parts of the clothing. These colored pigments came from various minerals or plants in nature, and the color matching was also very bold and avant-garde. There are also a few synthetic materials in the pigments, such as “Chinese purple”, “lead white” and “lead red”, which are considered to be artificially made.</p>
<p>It is understood that scientists first discovered barium copper silicate on Han Dynasty pottery in 1992 and called it “Han purple”. Later, it was found that it was widely used on the Qin Terracotta Army, so it is now generally called “Chinese purple”. The thousands of faces of the Terracotta Army are also vivid and lively due to the “dopamine” color dressing under the careful dressing of ancient craftsmen. Chinese purple is also used by some game art designers to extract design inspiration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230726/b69055f1-a5ad-466e-b634-16e3d47a72f1.png"></p>
<p>The “dopamine dressing” style of the Han Dynasty was based on classical elegance. Hanfu and Han etiquette showed the elegance in the hearts of Chinese people. The main colors of clothing were white, khaki, and brown, embellished with red and pink.</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty had a broad vision, broad mind and open attitude in terms of political and economic systems, culture and art, and social atmosphere. It absorbed foreign cultures, innovated and developed, and led China into a new era. The Tang Sancai human figurines preserved in many museums in Shaanxi also show the popular “dopamine” dressing at that time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230726/35ea4bc8-264b-4a63-b086-0f68cb372119.jpg"></p>
<p>“Clothes are wrapped in clouds and mist, and fairy music saves all beings.” In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the image of Longmen Feitian is perfectly restored on the character. The golden璎珞, 帔帛, the drooping clothes, and the color matching of pink, green and red have high recognition and excellent visual presentation effects, which can fully mobilize the positive emotions of players, and at the same time show the traditional Chinese culture, tracing back thousands of years, and presenting history to the world in a new look. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is dopamine dressing in reality or fashion matching in games, it is a new way for people to express healthy, positive and optimistic concepts. “Dopamine dressing” may be just one of the many concepts that have quickly become popular with the help of social media, but its diversified expression in various carriers, such as the combination with video games, also gives more people the courage to show their personality and preferences.</p>
