<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?"></a>1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?</h2><p>The Fogg Behavior Model was proposed by Dr. BJ Fogg, founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. The Fogg Behavior Model states that three elements must converge simultaneously for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of these three elements is missing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The degree of desire to perform a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Ability:</strong> The ease or difficulty of completing a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt:</strong> The incentives and feedback that trigger a certain behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be explained in a diagram. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F4c2d7e7d-8adb-46e4-b2bf-e8bd9e77b5a1.png/size/"></p>
<p>The essence of interaction design is the design of user behavior. The Fogg Model, as a classic user psychology model, can be said to be one of the underlying logics of interaction design and has important guiding significance for interaction design.</p>
<p>The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) makes it easier to understand behavior in general. It highlights three main elements, each with subcomponents. Specifically, the FBM outlines the core motivators (motivation), simplicity factors (ability), and types of prompts. The subcomponents define the larger elements; for example, in the FBM, the word <em>ability</em> refers to how simplicity factors work together in the context of prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Ff6956b2a-6f2d-4449-b15e-2c254b2c0471.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h3><p>Unlike psychologists who advocate for extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, Professor Fogg divides the sources of motivation into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensation (physical level):</strong> Essentially, sensation is driven by our pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. Some behaviors bring us pain (behaviors we want to avoid), some behaviors bring us pleasure (behaviors that motivate us to continue), and sometimes multiple motivations conflict with each other, leading to our mental anguish (such as wanting to lose weight but also wanting to eat high-calorie foods).</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation (emotional level):</strong> The benefits that can be obtained or the punishments that can be avoided by taking action (which can correspond to extrinsic motivation in psychology). For example, hope and fear are the most powerful motivators, making people yearn to be part of something very meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging (social level):</strong> This makes people feel that they are part of society, and this sense of belonging keeps them motivated. For example, all your friends are doing it (which corresponds to extrinsic motivation in psychology).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, motivation itself is constantly changing and very unstable. Therefore, in specific design, we can prioritize solving ability and prompt issues to improve the behavior conversion rate of motivated users. Secondly, we should seize the peak of user motivation to guide users to perform corresponding behaviors, rather than converting after the user’s motivation drops. When motivation is high, people can do difficult things, but once motivation declines, people will only complete easy things.</p>
<h3 id="Ability-Cost"><a href="#Ability-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Ability&#x2F;Cost"></a>Ability&#x2F;Cost</h3><p>The horizontal axis of the Fogg Model is ability, from “hard to do” to “easy to do.” Professor Fogg believes that people have a natural tendency to be lazy. Therefore, although people can be trained to perform target behaviors, it is usually more effective to make the behavior easy. In addition, he believes that what users care about most is cost. Instead of increasing his motivation to do something with more temptation, it is better to think about reducing the cost of doing it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F0c28bd6e-6c58-4fca-b9fc-d0bfd0fbd40b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In games, the player’s ability is reflected in the hero level, the player’s moves and abilities in the game, the amount of currency and items they have, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="Prompt"><a href="#Prompt" class="headerlink" title="Prompt"></a>Prompt</h3><p>The hardest thing in the world is “doing the right thing at the right time.” For promoting conversion, it is “persuading users to do what they can with the right motivation at the right time.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa5df5077-c0e5-4794-896f-12c9a6ae9578.png/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> When users do not have enough motivation, they need to be stimulated with explanatory text or videos to generate motivation, such as limited-time free items, discounts, and novice prizes for new users in the store.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitator:</strong> When users already have enough motivation, but sometimes they don’t know how to do it, they need help to complete the conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> When users have both the motivation to do it and know how to do it, what they need is a reminder at the right time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful conversion occurs when motivation is strong and implementation costs are low, which is above the threshold in the figure above. But sometimes, strong motivation and low cost cannot be fully satisfied. At this time, it is necessary to ensure that there is no design with high cost and insufficient user motivation.</p>

<li><strong>Increase player motivation - Reward distribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Providing a reward preview in the task interface allows players to know the specific rewards they can obtain by completing the task, thereby increasing players’ motivation to complete the task. Players often complete tasks they didn’t originally intend to do because they want specific rewards.</p>
<p>At the same time, since the motivation and ability required to stimulate player behavior are two complementary factors, when setting awards, it is also necessary to set the size of the reward according to the difficulty of the task. When a task is difficult, setting a reward of sufficiently high value can motivate players to take action. </p>

<p>The most common external motivations in games are various medals, rewards, and leaderboards. These rewards are not only a reward for players’ activity in the game, but also an external motivation to encourage players to improve their abilities and continue to be active in the game, prompting players to obtain these badges out of the mentality of “I want what others have.. </p>

<p>Just like shopping in daily life, when we see something that many people buy, we always can’t help but take a second look, and our desire to consume is higher. In the design of the store page, highlighting hot-selling products is also a way to increase players’ sense of belonging and stimulate consumption. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F517f816f-4734-4b22-a817-a9682e6d2e66.png/size/"></p>

<p>Increase the scarcity of goods - things are more valuable when they are rare. People always focus on what they will lose, not what they will get. When we see a limited-time discount in our shopping cart, we usually feel a sense of urgency that we are about to lose the opportunity to pick up a bargain. This mentality is also used in some game stores, using a combination of discounts and limited-time sales to stimulate player consumption. </p>

<li><strong>Reduce the difficulty of behavior by breaking down tasks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“By focusing on Simplicity of the target behavior you increase Ability.” Simplifying the target behavior is the process of empowering users.</p>
<p>Breaking down tasks into steps and guiding players to complete them is a common way to guide players to complete tasks step by step. In novice tasks, it is also common to gradually break down the tasks to guide players to accumulate experience. By turning some high-cost behaviors, such as completing tasks with larger goals, into small steps, and supplemented by different completion incentives, users can unknowingly accumulate a lot of successful experience. </p>

</ul>
<p>When players first enter a game, there is usually a novice guidance process to help players quickly understand the gameplay of the game and improve players’ abilities in the game. Whether the novice guidance can truly enable players to master the operation methods and gameplay of the game is also an important factor that determines whether players can stay in the game in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Small details to guide players to new information in the game - red dot prompts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Red dot prompts are a basic guiding method widely used in interaction design. For example, the various new message prompts in the apps we see most often in our lives use a small red dot to prompt users to open the message box to view messages, which also applies users’ obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology to a certain extent.</p>
<p>When a new costume is added to a hero, the red dot prompts at all levels of the path can ensure that players can accurately find the newly launched costume among the many pieces of information, thereby prompting players to try it on and purchase it. Including game updates, in-game event updates, and gameplay opening prompts, etc., can also be used in this simple way to guide players to participate in new activities in the game. </p>

<hr>
<p>Limited-time open gameplay prompt - <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s “Realm of Gods” gameplay is open for a limited time, but players may not accurately remember the opening time of the gameplay. A small red dot can remind players that the gameplay is open and it’s time to start a game. Without the prompt of a small red dot, players may gradually forget that this gameplay will be opened at a specific time. In this function, such a design not only guides players’ behavior, but also reduces players’ cognitive load. They no longer need to remember the opening time of the gameplay themselves. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make players more confident about the difficulty of the level - inform players of their abilities through UI differences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the “Realm of Gods” gameplay of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the UI difference of the recommended Divine Sense level above the level confirmation button visually informs players whether they have matched the behavioral ability required by the level. The gold color of recommended Divine Sense Level, indicates that the player has reached the recommended Divine Sense level, informing players that has the ability to perform this action, thus directly satisfying the “ability” factor that triggers the action. When the required behavioral ability is not reached, a red prompt is used to prevent players from misjudging their abilities and challenging the level, but instead gaining frustration from it. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>By deconstructing the Fogg Model theory behind the most basic interaction design, we can understand the three elements that affect user behavior: motivation, ability, and prompt (triggering element), helping us to design players’ trajectories in the game more purposefully during the design process, and to verify whether a design can well guide players’ behavior in design self-checks, thereby improving players’ gaming experience and motivating them to continue to be active in the game.</p>
