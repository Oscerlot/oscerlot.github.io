<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the global sweep of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> to <em>Fortnite’s</em> UEFN editor becoming a recent hit, the importance of UGC in the gaming field is increasing day by day. Many domestic and foreign game manufacturers have entered the game, either implementing editors in the game or providing level design activities, providing players with a series of level editing tools, allowing players to give full play to their creativity. This form of players being both content consumers and creators may become a major trend in the future development of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fd5e697fc-6397-4ac5-a8b9-ac617b27bdcb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>PUBG Mobile launched the creator mode “World of Wonder”, where players can freely build maps&#x2F;modes</em></p>
<p>At the same time, according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, players spend nearly half of their game time playing in the worlds created in Fortnite Creative, and some creators even earn a lot of income by helping commercial companies build custom worlds in <em>Fortnite</em>. Players’ desire and enthusiasm for UGC content can also be seen.</p>
<p>Among the endless player works, the creative masters among the players have attracted a lot of attention. Many well-known game media or game officials have interviewed them to explore the creative process and design inspiration of these players. There is no doubt that the stories of top creators can inspire developers and motivate onlookers, but they are still not enough for us to understand the entire UGC player ecosystem.</p>
<p>From the KOL pyramid model, ordinary UGC players (mid-tail + long-tail) are a large number of creators. What are the similarities and differences between them and top creators? What is their current situation? What are their demands? There is very little research and discussion at present. We contacted some players of popular UGC games on the market, hoping to provide some clues on how to tap and maintain this group of players with a large base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F54901c5d-686f-4bc4-a61a-52e9efda6e3c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?"></a>1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?</h2><p>Strawberry is a college student player who entered Roblox last year, but only started to try the editor this year. “Every time I log in, I will see the popular maps on the homepage. When I play those, I want to replicate a similar map.” Coincidentally, Green Wine, a veteran player of <em>Minecraft</em>, also has similar ideas. “I always see visual feast maps on Bilibili. The color matching is very good. I think it’s amazing. I also want to try to make a map of my own.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fb7d106aa-7438-4b56-9b0f-d8366786dfdb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Visual Feast</em></p>
<p>Or attracted by the popularity, similar to shooting Douyin&#x2F;posting on Weibo, they will follow the trend to post popular theme content or bring popular topic tags. Many ordinary UGC players “want to be able to make very popular works themselves, and want more people to like them. This may be the same as the current popular hotspots. No one will like a static model. Everyone wants to try popular things.” Trying to make similar UGC content to ride the trend has become the starting point of their creative path.</p>
<p>In addition, wanting to make maps for friends&#x2F;partners to check in and play together is also one of the opportunities for some players to start creating. Landscape check-in works are more common. Many players want to use the game editor as a carrier to create a place for themselves and their friends to leave memories&#x2F;commemorations. “The opportunity to start making maps is to make a commemorative map that can be played with friends, because when I play some maps with novel and beautiful scenery, it is worth checking in, so I want to create a commemorative map in my mind.” Similar to sandbox game players and MMO home players, these UGC creators hope to build homes or internet celebrity scenic spots, pursuing love &amp; peace. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F98679b75-3f73-401c-bbb8-be1b955c472b.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Dutch Windmill Village in Minecraft</em></p>
<p>Some creators also hope to make maps with stronger interaction, or create game levels that can be played together with friends, or make prank maps to see friends’ funny and frustrated reactions. “The opportunity is that I often go to play other people’s maps, so I want to make a map for my partners to play. At first, I wanted to make something for viewing, but if it is only for viewing and has no playability, I will add some gameplay.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F5fe1afcf-44f2-4bc3-a84a-0a848b3c8475.png/size/"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that there are a group of players who have the idea of ​​trying it themselves after seeing beautiful and amazing, or unique and fresh high-heat UGC content on social media. And their creative inspiration, or the idea of ​​starting to create, more or less revolves around one word - replication (imitation), either imitating the works of others, or moving reality into the game.</p>
<p>This is easy to understand. Compared with creating from scratch, replication has a clearer and more visible creative object, and the sense of goal will be relatively stronger, so that it will not be abandoned at the beginning; secondly, the “creation” threshold of replication is low, and the probability of success is high. You can feel the fun of creation and the sense of accomplishment in a short time. Many players can also make micro-innovations on the basis of replication, draw inferences from one another, and the investment cost is relatively low.</p>
<p>In addition, many creative novices enjoy the creative process, similar to the handmade circle. Seeing beautiful and interesting handicrafts (wool felt, cream glue, tufting, etc.), they will also want to follow the tutorial to make it themselves, and feel the fun of handmade DIY. “I started making maps because I thought YEET A PET was very interesting, so I wanted to try to make it myself, and then I slowly figured out some rules of the editor,” said Lemon Tea, a Roblox player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F7996b687-7fea-40b4-95c9-2180f4768008.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Popular Roblox Game, “YEET A PET”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been increasingly confirmed after asking them about their creative ideas and creative bottlenecks. The creative ideas of these players have obvious commonalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of gameplay type design, most of them are based on cross-border reference, such as landscape check-in, escape room, haunted house, LARP, and so on. The specific level design is also not innovative from scratch, but draws inspiration from reality (variety shows, film and television dramas, novels, lyrics, etc.) or other games</li>
<li>The art style is also mostly following the trend, with real life (buildings&#x2F;natural scenery and other landscapes, IP images in other fields, etc.) and official season styles being sources of inspiration</li>
<li>Or follow the current hot spots, and wait for top creators to research and develop new gameplay&#x2F;new art styles, and then follow the trend to gradually form a trend</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that their ideas are not creative enough, but that they think it is difficult to materialize the ideas out of thin air. “I have a lot of ideas, but I just can’t make them.” This is mostly limited by the breadth and depth of their use of tools.</p>
<p>For ordinary creators, the introduction and use of UGC tools often “borrow” ideas from top creators. Regarding tool usage skills (how to use advanced tools, how to combine tools, what kind of finished products can be made with XX tools, what functions can improve the efficiency of mapping, etc.), they usually need to provide a problem-solving idea, or have examples to explain the principle of tool use, absorb + use it from practice, so as to draw inferences from one another, and adapt&#x2F;create new content themselves.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?"></a>2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?</h2><p>Similar to top creators, the motivation for ordinary UGC players to continue creating is mostly the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Fun] Creating results with their own hands, experiencing the fun and sense of accomplishment of creation</li>
<li>[Recognition] Continuously gaining likes and recognition from the public, and resonating with everyone through their works</li>
<li>[Opportunity] Gaining recognition and support from the official, thereby further expanding their influence</li>
<li>[Reward] Discovering actual material rewards &amp; income opportunities (such as providing customized services, becoming a social media KOL)</li>
<li>[Community belonging] Making new friends during the creative process, often conducting friendly exchanges and discussions, and generating a sense of community belongin.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the process of constantly contacting creators, we also found that, in addition to generating electricity for love, ordinary UGC players are more motivated by the support and encouragement of the audience and fans, as well as the monetization opportunities they seek, to overcome difficulties and improve their creations.</p>
<p>Although the long-lasting incentives of the platform and the occasional stories of popular authors have “tempted” many players to enter the circle, in fact, players have also noticed that “it’s not our turn”, “winning the competition is only because of traffic, there must be gold buried. Like the famous gods now, the popular maps are always made by the same people, and the usual map push traffic is also very poor, no one comes to play, there is really no motivation.” The feeling of pouring out all their enthusiasm makes ordinary creators with a small fan base feel more and more difficult to get ahead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F8c7972db-7800-4272-8e1e-1c7bc14c4b9f.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F825c0085-9256-430d-9fbb-01c80f86c131.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic"><a href="#Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic" class="headerlink" title="Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic"></a><em>Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic</em></h2><p>On the one hand, aside from players who only care about the fun of creation, ordinary creators often face the dilemma of entering the game late and finding it difficult to get ahead. Unlike the top creators at the top of the pyramid, they have relied on continuous themes and content innovation, coupled with personal characteristics, and finally have an unshakable position in the subdivided field. However, ordinary creators are limited by the shrinking blue ocean theme field, and they also lack the ability to use tools, and they don’t know where to start to create content with their own characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, game UGC, as a content creation track, most of the UGC content recommendation systems in the game are not much different from the operation ideas of external vertical communities. The platform and top creators have a “symbiotic relationship”, and the platform’s traffic will unconsciously tilt towards the top. First, in terms of commercial realization, top creators are an important bargaining chip for the platform, and the platform will also give top creators more monetization opportunities. Secondly, in terms of user ecology, top creators can help the platform attract new users and stimulate user activity with strong and distinctive content creation, and the platform can be more inclined to top creators in terms of recommendation algorithms. Therefore, in the content ecosystem created by the platform, the status of creators in different circles of the pyramid is very different. The higher you go, the harder it is to break the barriers between circles.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>UGC has become a new trend in the development of the game industry. However, in addition to relying on the guidance and drive of top creators, ordinary players are also an indispensable part of this ecology. Therefore, how to bring high-quality, high-potential maps to consumer players, how to make ordinary creators stand out, continuously supplement and support creators, and avoid the phenomenon of monopoly or lack of successors, is a long-term operation problem that UGC game manufacturers urgently need to consider.</p>
