<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Southeast Asian game market has always been a must-go place for many manufacturers when expanding overseas, with huge potential. It has also been called the fastest-growing region for the global game market by Newzoo. According to Statista, the total size of the game market in the region was US$5.24 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow to US$6.28 billion by 2024 and US$7.47 billion by 2027.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia has 11 countries, a total population of 650 million, and 380 million Internet users, with an Internet penetration rate of 58%, and this proportion will continue to increase; mobile devices are becoming cheaper and more powerful for Southeast Asian consumers, which also contributes to the fact that more than two-thirds (67%) of the game industry’s revenue in the region comes from mobile devices, while the proportion of PCs is only 24%, and consoles only account for 9%.</p>
<p>Clearly, Southeast Asia is a mobile-first market. As the country with the second-largest GDP in Southeast Asia, Thailand’s 32 million gamers have helped the Thai game market generate more than 6.8 billion RMB in revenue, making it one of the most notable game markets in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As one of the most important countries for domestic games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia, the Thai mobile market has unlimited possibilities. And a full understanding of local users will be a very important factor affecting the success of overseas expansion in this country. Recently, for a game under development, we went to Bangkok, the largest city in Thailand, and two border cities in Thailand, Ubon Ratchathani and Chiang Mai, to conduct in-depth research.</p>
<h2 id="1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand"><a href="#1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand"></a>1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand</h2><p>Before setting off, we collected some data to understand the currently popular games in Thailand. Combined with past research experience, we initially came to the following hypothesis: Thai players like to play games developed by their own country, and in terms of game types, they prefer multiplayer competitive games, especially MOBA, battle royale, MMORPG, and casual games, which have the best revenue in Thailand.</p>
<p>Take the top ten of the iOS best-selling list on April 2, 2023 (from Qimai Data) as an example, including 4 casual games, 1 MOBA game, 2 sports games, 1 MMORPG, and 1 shooting game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F50ec6006-97ab-4000-99c6-56c9be46e107.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Free Fire</em>, published by Garena, one of the largest publishers in Thailand, is very popular; in addition, football mobile games are also very popular in Thailand. <em>eFootball 2023</em> has long occupied the top three of the best-selling list in Thailand, and often competes for the first place.</p>
<h2 id="2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research"><a href="#2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. First-hand Information on Thai Research"></a>2. First-hand Information on Thai Research</h2><h3 id="Thai-Prices"><a href="#Thai-Prices" class="headerlink" title="Thai Prices"></a>Thai Prices</h3><p>According to data from Thai statistical agencies, as the largest city in Thailand, the average monthly salary in Bangkok in 2022 was 22,274 baht (approximately 4,219 RMB). The cost of living in Bangkok is similar to that of second-tier cities in China. A meal can be solved at a street stall for 100 baht, and a meal in a food court in a large shopping mall can be settled for about 200 baht. In addition, the 7-Elevens that can be seen everywhere in Bangkok are also similar in price to domestic convenience stores.</p>
<p>Combined with the average monthly income of Bangkok, residents have a certain amount of entertainment consumption in their disposable income. Mobile games are a very popular form of entertainment for young people in Thailand, and making some recharges in mobile games is also very acceptable to many young people, which is one of the fundamental reasons why the Thai mobile game market is so hot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F01da278b-b56f-4a83-879c-92a120d78bfe.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Thai-People’s-Travel"><a href="#Thai-People’s-Travel" class="headerlink" title="Thai People’s Travel"></a>Thai People’s Travel</h3><p>Thailand is located in the south-central part of Asia, and it is hot most of the year. It happened to be midsummer when we went, so in many cases, there were fewer people walking on the street, and everyone chose to travel by motorcycle, car, etc. Thai universities generally have a large area, and many students also choose to use motorcycles to travel in school. Based on the characteristics of this national condition, in order to reach more young people and conduct street interviews in Thai universities, we chose more indoor places with a lot of traffic. When there are not many pedestrians on the road, it is difficult to invite students to do user testing and random interviews.</p>
<h3 id="Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand"><a href="#Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand"></a>Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand</h3><p>Different from China, there are few Internet cafes in Thailand and their business hours are short. An Internet cafe we found after walking for more than 20 minutes in Bangkok was only open from 2 pm to 10 pm. Through research, we found that many young people in Thailand said that they basically don’t go to Internet cafes. One of the reasons is that during the epidemic, Internet cafes were strictly controlled. Some people had their own PC devices or started playing mobile games. Combined with the factors such as the high cost performance and rapid technological upgrading of mobile devices, the share of mobile games in Thailand will be much higher than that of PC games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F24f11f92-c390-4933-9313-74f87c7926fd.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Here, in addition to games, the most popular form of entertainment for young people is to gather with friends in board game cafes to play board games, or chat and play games in cafes. Most of these places also provide WIFI. Playing against&#x2F;with friends has also become an important form of entertainment for them. No matter what they do, for many Thai players, having friends together is their most important entertainment condition. This is also one of the reasons why Thai players value social interaction so much in games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F7a8831bd-8ed9-4ff4-871a-eba5bb24329d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Sports-that-Thai-People-Like"><a href="#Sports-that-Thai-People-Like" class="headerlink" title="Sports that Thai People Like"></a>Sports that Thai People Like</h3><p>Thailand can be said to be a country of football. Football-related advertisements can be seen everywhere, and public football fields here are almost all open for free. Because there are many people playing, it is also common to see queues. At present, almost every province, county, and village in Thailand has its own non-professional team, and many schools also have their own school teams. Thai people like to play football and integrate football into their lives, which can also be seen in their TV dramas, movies, and public service advertisements.</p>
<p>The situation we observed in the sports field of the university was that there were only a few people playing basketball at about 4 pm, while there were already more than 10 people playing football. The love of Thai people for football is also reflected in the game market. The reason why the aforementioned <em>eFootball2023</em> can occupy the top three of the mobile game best-selling list for a long time, and even occasionally compete for the first place, is inseparable from the fact that everyone loves this sport and the player base is large. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F9ef059c9-8d17-46ea-85f0-6d9b66acb32a.jpg.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F6dcf136f-947e-418f-a21f-ece66661f79d.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content"><a href="#Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content" class="headerlink" title="Thai People Like Personalized Content"></a>Thai People Like Personalized Content</h3><p>From the perspective of game character selection, some players are not very impressed with some stars and big IPs in the game. On the contrary, they want to get a personalized experience in the game, such as playing a role like themselves in a game. When choosing a map they don’t like, they will also judge it based on reasons such as it being too popular, too common, and wanting a unique scene. On the streets of Bangkok, large-scale graffiti that can be seen everywhere is also a manifestation of personalization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F136baea9-9382-4b19-911b-d9689f231a8a.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Mobile-Device-Selection"><a href="#Mobile-Device-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Device Selection"></a>Mobile Device Selection</h3><p>Among the research group, we found that most users mainly use Android phones, and the price is generally between 1,000 and 3,000 RMB. The price also limits the performance parameters of users’ mobile phones, and the limitation of mobile phone performance will lead to some rigid requirements for players’ choice of games. In addition, similar to other Southeast Asian countries, there are many Android mobile phone manufacturers in the Thai market, with a wide variety of models, and there are also a large number of old machines from many years ago, which also puts certain adaptation and optimization pressure on games that want to expand overseas to Thailand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F00e7e298-f19c-45d9-8fdc-448573b21c60.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games"><a href="#3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games"></a>3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games</h2><p>In this research, based on the purpose of the research and previous assumptions, we mainly conducted street interviews on pedestrians on the streets of three cities in Thailand to understand their age, occupation, personal hobbies, game experience, etc. Based on some research results, here is a summary of the factors that Thai players value when choosing games:</p>
<h3 id="Short-Duration"><a href="#Short-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Short Duration"></a>Short Duration</h3><p>Similar to white-collar workers in many countries, the working hours of white-collar workers in Bangkok, Thailand are generally 8-9 am to 5-6 pm, with an hour for lunch, including meals. White-collar workers do not have much time to spend on games during the day on weekdays, and many players tend to choose games with short single play times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F09318b2f-361e-4a35-a216-bd950b3f060d.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Some CBDs have a street of small stalls, and many white-collar workers choose to have lunch here</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles"><a href="#Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles" class="headerlink" title="Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles"></a>Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles</h3><p>The art style is what many Thai players pay attention to first when they see advertisements. Whether they like the art style is an important factor in whether they will download the game. Thai players are more influenced by Japanese and Korean comics in terms of art, and they will prefer games with Japanese and Korean comic art style themes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2Fc5582ae2-38b3-4e4b-97bd-689e41169935.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bookstores in Thailand display many Japanese comics</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Social-Interaction"><a href="#Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Social Interaction"></a>Social Interaction</h3><p>Social interaction is one of the reasons why Thai players pay great attention to when choosing games. Whether they can play with friends, and whether there is enough interaction when playing with friends, are important indicators that affect their choice of a game. Some players believe that even if a game is fun, they will not be able to continue to experience it in depth without friends; and even if a game is not very fond of the subject matter, playing with friends and being able to get a good enough interactive experience can also drive players to follow in the footsteps of their friends and play together. Not only games, but many activities in users’ lives are also for social purposes, such as playing basketball or other sports, which is just a form of gathering with friends.</p>
<h2 id="4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions"><a href="#4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions" class="headerlink" title="4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions"></a>4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions</h2><p>If you also want to do research in Thailand, how should you choose the research method, player recruitment, and research location?</p>
<p>First of all, it is recommended to find places in the target city where the target population may be more concentrated, and conduct preliminary site visits. Take Bangkok as an example, BTS stations, shopping malls, and university campuses are all places with a lot of traffic. However, not all locations are suitable for research. For example, people at BTS stations are in a hurry, and basically no one has time to accept interviews or research, let alone stop to test your game, even for a few minutes. Cafes and board game cafes near shopping malls or universities usually have a lot of free young people, and these places can be considered as priority locations for interviews. However, it should be noted that Thailand has begun to use PDPA laws. If you want to conduct interviews in places with a lot of traffic, you need to submit a written application to the local agency. At the same time, we recommend avoiding conducting research in some popular tourist attractions or airports, where most of the people encountered will be tourists, and it is conceivable that some errors may occur in the research results.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, if there are no professional language personnel, you can choose a local supplier to provide freelancers for Thai language research; if the target group to be researched is relatively fixed, you can also recruit some players who are interested in participating in the research in advance before traveling. For example, if the target group is relatively young, you can contact some suppliers in advance to find players in the university who are interested in games or have similar game experience, and make appointments for all the time before departure, which can greatly improve the efficiency of interviews and research. Pay attention to arranging time for the executing freelancers to train in the interview outline and process to avoid problems such as inadequate implementation and insufficient results in the later stage; if it involves the execution of multiple player studies, after each test, you can promptly review the research situation of the day with the executing personnel, so as to make adjustments to the research plan in time, improve the execution details, and at the same time produce an agile summary, which will be able to complete the research of the day relatively comprehensively.</p>
<p>The important thing about overseas field research is to understand the local situation in advance; before traveling, determine the target population and master the living habits related to the target population and research purpose, such as entertainment methods, travel and consumption preferences, etc. This can improve efficiency in research, save execution time, and ensure the final research results.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, Thailand’s Internet penetration rate is steadily increasing, the population structure is young, and the mobile game market still has great potential for development. It is a must-see place for games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia. This field research on Thai users can help us better understand the different regional markets in Thailand and all aspects of Thai game players, so that our games expanding overseas can better adapt to the local environment, reduce distribution risks, and provide a better game experience for a wider range of overseas players.</p>
