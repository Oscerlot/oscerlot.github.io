<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230821/28584_1105623.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, going global has become an unavoidable battle of strength and resources for Chinese game manufacturers.</p>
<p>The core of a game going global is “localization.” In addition to product, language, style, and cultural localization, understanding and adapting to the laws, regulations, and policies of the local overseas market is also a crucial part of localization.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four main legal compliance issues that deserve attention. First, the market access issue of “games going global”; second, overseas game rating systems; third, the cross-border data flow issue of “games going global”; and fourth, the consumer protection of “games going global.” We will elaborate on these with cases from different countries or regions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Taiwan-China"><a href="#Taiwan-China" class="headerlink" title="Taiwan, China"></a>Taiwan, China</h3><p>Currently, the game market in Taiwan, China is not directly open to mainland companies. The reason is that Taiwan’s “Cross-Strait People’s Relations Regulations” has the following local regulations: “Profit-making enterprises in the mainland area shall not engage in business activities in Taiwan unless they have been approved by the competent authority and have established a branch or office in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>If mainland game manufacturers publish games in Taiwan, they generally choose one of the following two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cooperate with a local agent in Taiwan. For example, a mainland company acts as the game developer, and a Taiwan company acts as the game publisher and operator. According to Taiwan regulations, if the developer, producer, and publisher of the game are mainland-funded, the Taiwan agent should enter the game information and submit proof of agency before the game goes live.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish an overseas company and launch the game in Taiwan through the Apple App Store and Google Play. However, in terms of specific game product promotion and marketing, mainland companies still need to cooperate with Taiwan companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Vietnam"><a href="#Vietnam" class="headerlink" title="Vietnam"></a>Vietnam</h3><p>Games are subject to government approval and licensing. Two licenses are required during the game’s operation: the first is the company’s operating qualification, and the second is the product’s launch license. Vietnam’s game publishing license regulations are relatively strict, and it takes about 6-9 months to apply for this license. However, given the qualifications and government review, not every publisher has sufficient conditions and capabilities to apply for a game license. At the same time, the Vietnamese government’s supervision of mobile games is also stricter than that of China. Therefore, Chinese developers who want to enter Vietnam must thoroughly study the relevant laws of Vietnam to avoid being unable to meet players in the region after making many preparations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems"><a href="#2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Overseas Game Rating Systems"></a>2. Overseas Game Rating Systems</h2><h3 id="South-Korea"><a href="#South-Korea" class="headerlink" title="South Korea"></a>South Korea</h3><p>South Korea strictly implements a game rating system. The GRB rating standards have five levels: All Ages, 18+, 15+, 12+, and Test Level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fb445e865-dc61-4557-ad1c-b50f3a87134e.png/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, what needs special explanation and description is the “Test Level,” which means that game manufacturers can conduct preliminary public tests on the product’s stability and other aspects within 30 days before the official launch of the game product, and the exclusive “Test Level” logo should be placed at this time.</p>
<p>In addition, all games must not only place rating logos, but also display content logos (such as violence logos, tobacco, alcohol, and drug logos, sex logos, etc.) for content in the game that may have negative effects.</p>
<h3 id="Japan"><a href="#Japan" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>A game rating system already exists in the Japanese market. According to relevant Japanese regulations, game software is divided into five levels according to content, and provided to consumers of different ages according to specific ratings. The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) classifies the levels based on whether the game content involves sexual performance, violent performance, anti-social behavior, language or thought, and the specific degree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F28890d5b-2817-49a2-a0e5-b6e507f176e4.png/size/"></p>
<p>With the rise of mobile games, more games are provided to players through app stores. The Apple App Store and Google Play have their own rating standards for the games provided on their platforms. For example, the Apple App Store divides the games that can be listed into four main categories, and requires developers to fill in their own declarations according to the Apple rating standards when reviewing games.</p>
<h3 id="United-States"><a href="#United-States" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>The United States is a pioneer in game rating systems. As early as the early 1990s, the undisguised violence in <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> caused a great backlash from public opinion, prompting the American game industry to unite and try to formulate a game rating system.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States generally implements the ESRB rating system, which is divided into six levels: E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), AO (Adults Only 18+), and RP (Rating Pending). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F6c1ca039-ec29-48a0-957f-5ca9ed70bf9e.png/size/"></p>
<p>The above ratings apply not only to the game content itself, but also to game promotional advertisements. Although the ESRB rating system follows the principle of voluntariness, almost all games in Canada and the United States are rated, otherwise they may not be distributed to the public.</p>
<p>Many players also use the information of the ESRB rating to secretly infer whether a certain game is about to be launched, or the general content direction of the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="United-States-1"><a href="#United-States-1" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>CCPA is the abbreviation of The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. It is another information data protection bill introduced by California, USA on June 28, 2018, and officially implemented on January 1, 2020. It is known as the “strictest and most comprehensive personal privacy protection bill” in the United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fe70ff009-f81e-4f37-88cd-1cae2de5bd78.png/size/"></p>
<p>The jurisdiction principle of CCPA is the principle of personality, that is, it only protects California residents. If every aspect of the game manufacturer’s information collection of players (including the player’s affiliation) is not in California, it is not subject to CCPA. However, since California has a population of more than 40 million, game manufacturers theoretically cannot distinguish whether players are California residents through IP addresses, and California is the most economically developed state in the United States, with the most prosperous Internet and technological innovation. Game manufacturers going global in the United States will inevitably be regulated by CCPA.</p>
<p>The main content of CCPA is actually to give players more control over the collection and management of their personal information by game manufacturers, including but not limited to: the right to know, the right to delete, the right to refuse, the right to opt-in, and the right to opt-out.</p>
<p>If the game manufacturer fails to follow the rules of CCPA, violates its obligations and fails to implement and maintain security procedures and take measures consistent with the nature of the information to protect the player’s personal information, thus suffering unauthorized access and leakage, theft or disclosure, the player can file a civil lawsuit. Game manufacturers may be required to pay each player $100-750 in damages or actual damages (whichever is greater), or face injunctions, etc.</p>
<h3 id="EU"><a href="#EU" class="headerlink" title="EU"></a>EU</h3><p>On May 25, 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), known as the strictest data protection regulation in history, was officially implemented. It puts forward high requirements for enterprises to collect, store, protect, transfer, and use users’ personal information data within the EU. With its wide scope of application and severe penalties, it has aroused widespread concern among Chinese game companies going global. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F06a69c1f-ef55-439b-ad37-315625a62b42.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the GDPR, game companies will be subject to the GDPR in the following situations: First, the game company has an establishment in the EU, regardless of whether its data processing behavior occurs in the EU; second, even if the game company’s place of business is not located in the EU, as long as it provides services to players in the EU (whether or not it charges players), or monitors the behavior of players in the EU.</p>
<p>For game companies going global that are subject to the GDPR, the consequences of violating the bill are very serious. According to Article 83 of the GDPR, the regulatory authority has the right to impose two levels of administrative penalties on enterprises for different illegal acts. The first level can be up to an administrative fine of 10 million euros, or an administrative fine of 2% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher); the second level can be up to an administrative fine of 20 million euros, or an administrative fine of 4% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher). When game companies go global in the EU, they should treat the GDPR bill with caution, and explain the scope of information collection, how it is stored, and how the information will be used in a simple and easy-to-understand form and language before collecting player personal information.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Meta was fined $1.2 billion for violating relevant provisions of the GDPR by transferring user data across borders to the United States, which is also the heaviest fine issued by EU regulators since the bill came into effect.</p>
<h2 id="4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Japan-1"><a href="#Japan-1" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>According to the “Online Game Operation Specifications” formulated by the Japan Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA), games are required to clearly indicate the estimated amount of rare items obtained in the Gacha gameplay (similar to loot boxes) in the Gacha mechanism. The upper and lower limits of the Gacha drop rate must be provided in the Gacha machine; the respective drop rates are provided according to the types of Gacha items, etc.</p>
<p>Such regulations are similar to our domestic regulations on the publicity of draw probabilities - the main purpose is to prevent games from prompting users to overpay with unclear drop probabilities. The difference between the two is that the regulations on probability publicity in China are government regulations, while Japan is a self-regulatory norm of the association. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F3b736d7e-0bd8-4ef0-a6f3-211b5b895651.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>At the same time, in Article 3.1 of Apple’s “App Store Review Guidelines”, it has been clearly stated that apps that provide “loot boxes” or other mechanisms to purchase random virtual items must disclose the odds of obtaining each type of item to customers before they purchase. Therefore, manufacturers that provide games through the Apple App Store also need to comply with the regulation of random draw probability publicity.</p>
<h3 id="United-States-2"><a href="#United-States-2" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>Loot boxes are an effective profit model explored by game manufacturers. Previously, the United States had not passed clear laws and regulations on loot box gameplay to ensure that the rights and interests of players were protected. Even if Hawaii had tried to make efforts, it had not passed any effective bills. Therefore, loot box gameplay is prevalent in the American game market.</p>
<p>But now this one of the world’s largest game markets has begun to legislate. In 2019, Republican lawmakers in the United States formally submitted a bill to Congress to prohibit game manufacturers from opening loot box gameplay to minors. This bill means that in all states of the United States, game companies will no longer be allowed to open loot box gameplay to minors under the age of 18, otherwise they may face corresponding fines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F263945d9-ccca-4c58-8219-ed32593e45a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>Under the influence of this bill, Google added a new policy to Google Play, requiring games to clearly inform players of the drop rate of these items before they pay. At the same time, Google has added more restrictions to gambling games. “Cash and other items of value” that could originally be used as rewards are now strictly limited to “cash and other items of real value.”</p>
<h3 id="Europe"><a href="#Europe" class="headerlink" title="Europe"></a>Europe</h3><p>European countries have also taken measures against the game loot box mechanism.</p>
<p>The Belgian Gaming Commission (BGC) issued a report on game loot boxes, defining this payment system as gambling, and stating that game companies that violate local laws will face fines to imprisonment. This directly led to the region lock of <em>FIFA</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> loot boxes, and Nintendo removed <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> from the Belgian region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fc734fc1d-173d-4e17-a177-efb19a42d856.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the Netherlands, six members of parliament jointly submitted a bill to the House of Representatives to restrict game loot boxes, aiming to prohibit elements such as “loot boxes” and “gacha” from appearing in Dutch games. Members of parliament believe that this gameplay is essentially a kind of gambling, but it is covered with a layer of “micro-transactions” by manufacturers, and there is a possibility of attracting immature children to recharge to obtain benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, Spain has also submitted a new bill to restrict game loot boxes, which also strictly controls “loot boxes” and “gacha” elements, and is even more detailed than the Netherlands. It is reported that Spain’s new bill requires players to provide official age certificates, implement mandatory recharge limits, and require developers to disclose detailed odds of loot drops&#x2F;draws, and impose stricter restrictions on “loot boxes” and “gacha”. Those who do not comply with the new regulations will be fined between 25 and 100 euros.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, game companies going global is both an opportunity and a challenge. If you want to be invincible and forge ahead in the journey of going global, while building your own excellent game product strength, you need to pay attention to the various laws and regulations of the target market, as well as religious, cultural, customs and habits. In addition to completing text and cultural localization, it is necessary to do a good job of product compliance localization, pay attention to market access thresholds, game rating systems, cross-border data flow, and consumer protection issues.</p>
