<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games"></a>1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games</h2><p>“Are you a GG or an MM?” “YYDS” “666” “GG”.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t play games, you can more or less hear these words or phrases in many situations in life. This kind of expression is the so-called “game slang”, most of which originated from the mouths of game players, and basically has some humorous color. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F234e7be8-7321-475f-8637-f40ad7e83037.png/size/"></p>
<p>The so-called “slang” originally referred to some cryptic words created by various groups or communities in the civil society during the feudal society due to their cultural customs and communication needs. It was mainly used by people in the underworld to communicate privately and hide secrets. In modern times, after the development of the Internet, some special terms used on the Internet or in games are also called “Internet slang” or “game slang”.</p>
<p>The Internet and the game world are full of all kinds of players. As the saying goes, “Where there are people, there is a <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, literally “rivers and lakes”, referring to the martial arts world or the underworld)”. Therefore, players who walk in the game <em>jianghu</em> have gradually created sets of unique “game slang” that only people in their own circle can understand.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but many overseas games also have exclusive “slang” and are widely known. For example, “氪金 (kè jīn)” refers to the act of recharging in the game. This word is considered to be a transliteration and misreading of the Japanese word 課金 (かきん - kakīn). In Japanese, 課金 (kakīn) refers to the profit model of using cash to purchase game resources in the game. The transformation from “課金” to “氪金” is not simply because the two are pronounced similarly, but because in the “Burning Crusade” expansion of the game <em>World of Warcraft</em>, a rare ore translated as “Khorium” in the Chinese server was added. Due to its extremely valuable nature, this ore has always had a very high price. Therefore, after the rise of mobile games, some players linked “氪金” and “課金” together, not only because of the pronunciation, but also because of the value of the two. </p>

<h3 id="Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear"><a href="#Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Why Does “Slang” Appear?"></a>Why Does “Slang” Appear?</h3><p>The reasons for the emergence of slang are diverse. One reason can be attributed to the fact that the names of equipment and skills in the game are too long, and they are not smooth to say in actual combat. For example, in the game <em>EVE Online</em>, game terms such as Warp Scrambler and Stasis Webifier are too tongue-twisting. When playing the game, saying the full name will affect the command, etc. Therefore, for convenience, these equipment will be referred to according to the equipment effect or the abbreviation of the equipment name. For example, the slang of the Warp Scrambler mentioned above is “long point” (长反 - cháng fǎn) because it has a longer range, but the warp disruption strength caused is lower, and it cannot close the microwarpdrive. In addition to weapons, equipment, and skills, players will also “attack” the names of heroes. Many games have also given many “slang names” to some heroes due to players’ consensus on the appearance, skills, and background of these heroes.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see from the above that the “slang” that appears in the game is generally for the convenience of players to communicate when playing. In a fast-paced online game, players generally do not have much time to type, and the game itself only provides some very simple signals to help players communicate quickly. Therefore, players will invent “slang”, which is generally short and vivid.</p>
<p>Of course, the emergence and spread of game slang cannot be separated from the “humorous and comedic” effect. When a particular expression can achieve a strong comedic effect in a certain situation, players will start to use it frequently in other similar scenes. Coupled with the entertainment attributes of the game itself, this slang will naturally begin to spread widely.</p>
<h2 id="2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games"><a href="#2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games"></a>2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games</h2><p>Most overseas and domestic games have unique “slang” tables, including everything from in-game character names to game items, to various sentences and words used by players when communicating in the game community, as well as their abbreviations and nicknames. We will take the Chinese, Japanese, and English versions of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as the main examples to summarize the frequently appearing game “slang” and their meanings.</p>
<p>As a multiplayer online game with a multiplayer team mode, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has also spawned a lot of “slang” in social aspects. In addition to text, this “slang” also exists in the form of emoji and kaomoji, which plays a great role in player communication in the game community.</p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>’s Chinese server duos or trios teams, you often hear words like “帮我拆火 (bāng wǒ chāi huǒ - help me break the fire)”, “咱们去空投 (zán men qù kōng tóu - let’s go to the airdrop)”, “猛蓄猛出 (měng xù měng chū - fierce charge and release)”, “压力怪 (yā lì guài - pressure monster)”, “拉我 (lā wǒ - pull me)” and so on. These slang words may sound confusing to players who don’t play this game, but they are familiar to veteran players. The word “拆火” means to help teammates fight against the enemy and interfere when teammates are attacked by the enemy, so as to achieve the purpose of dispersing firepower. “空投” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> refers to the supplies dropped in the safe zone, “Airdrop”. The meaning of “猛蓄猛出” is easy to understand, referring to players who only charge and release directly. “压力怪” does not mean that they feel a lot of pressure, but usually refers to people who “put pressure” on their teammates in the game to achieve their own emotional venting. There are many ways to exert pressure, such as verbal pressure (ridicule, abuse) and behavioral pressure (malicious interference), etc. Chinese server players even change the part of speech of the name “压力” into a verb, creating new “slang” in the form of “pressure teammates”. </p>

<p><em>Some of the Slang in Naraka: Bladepoint</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When studying the “slang” of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s English and Japanese regions, we found that the “slang” used by overseas players when chatting in the game community is mostly abbreviations of daily expressions and game terms, followed by emoji. We have summarized some of them in the table below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2Fd3a1b446-c56a-45c1-8beb-2c82a1789e6d.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Challenges-of-“Slang”-Translation-in-the-Localization-Process"><a href="#3-Challenges-of-“Slang”-Translation-in-the-Localization-Process" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process"></a>3. Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process</h2><p>It can be seen from the table above that the “slang” in English and Japanese includes abbreviations, generalizations and codes of game terms and daily expressions. There are also direct use of pictures, such as emoji, or kaomoji to express one’s feelings more vividly.</p>
<p>Some of these “slang” are even very similar to those we use in China. For example, English players will use “rmb” to refer to the “right mouse button” in the game, and Japanese players will use “草 (kusa - grass)” to express “laugh” or “www” (the Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter sounds). However, it should be noted that although the two are very similar and even written the same way, their meanings are completely different in different language environments. In addition, “slang” is often concise, obscure, and targeted. Not to mention foreign players, some new players in the server do not understand it at all. Therefore, in the process of game localization translation, how to translate these “slang” so that players of the corresponding language can also quickly understand the meaning it conveys and facilitate smoother communication between players has become a major challenge in the localization process.</p>
<h3 id="Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries"><a href="#Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries"></a>Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries</h3><p>Different regions have different cultures. The differences between one culture and other cultures constitute cultural barriers, which are mainly reflected in the differences in language, way of thinking, customs, religious beliefs, moral standards, political and legal systems, and outlook on life, world outlook, and values. In the localization process of a game dominated by multiplayer gameplay, the localization team needs to consider the convenience of communication between players, and focus on translating by studying the cultural characteristics of the target area and the style of “slang” in other games in the area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F1676f96a-6fdf-461b-9a97-fcc9f80c12f6.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Unlike in other countries, GG in China has a negative connotation.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In English-speaking regions, players are more inclined to abbreviate in-game props and terms, or abbreviate two words after splicing them together to achieve the purpose of fast typing and communication; Japanese players tend to create “slang” based on the characteristics of game terms (appearance, etc.) combined with local culture. As mentioned above, “Fiddlesticks” is called “かかし (kakashi)” because “かかし (kakashi)” originally means scarecrow in Japanese, and the surname of “Kakashi Hatake” in <em>Naruto</em> is “Hatake”, which can be translated as “rice field”. Therefore, Japanese players will associate the two. In addition, many “草 (kusa)” Internet buzzwords suddenly appeared in Japan in 2022 because the Romaji of “笑 (warai - laugh)” in Japanese is “warau”, so “www” is used to express laughter, and “w” looks like a bunch of grass, so “笑 (warai)” is replaced by “草 (kusa)” in Japanese Internet buzzwords.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to translate the “slang” in the game well, you must first be among the player groups, understand the local culture, and understand what kind of terms players in the target market will use in their daily lives, and what the structure of these terms is. When literal translation is not possible, by tracing the composition of the term and translating its origin, the word can be translated more accurately. This requires actively participating in the community of the target language during localization, mastering the rules of “slang” in a large number of daily communication with players, becoming familiar with the local culture, understanding the cultural differences between the two countries, and striving to break through cultural barriers.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>At present, domestic games are booming in overseas markets, but for mature markets such as Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States, local game manufacturers or global top manufacturers have generally been deeply involved for many years and have strong competitive barriers. Coupled with the cultural differences between the two places, the competitiveness of the overseas expansion of domestic games has gradually increased. Domestic games can build a bridge of communication between players of the two languages through localization, reduce cultural barriers through localization, spread excellent culture, so that games not only “go out” overseas, but also “stand firm”. Through localization, games can be culturally empowered, and appropriate “slang” can form another link between games and players, and players and players.</p>
