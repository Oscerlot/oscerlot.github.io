<h2 id="1-Localization-and-Character-Image"><a href="#1-Localization-and-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="1. Localization and Character Image"></a>1. Localization and Character Image</h2><p>Localization is the process of adapting a product or service to the differences of different markets. It is often confused with translation, but it actually goes far beyond the scope of translation. Translation is only one of several services that make up the localization process.</p>
<p>In addition to translation, the localization process may also include adjusting graphics according to the target market, modifying the content layout to adapt to the translated text, converting to local currency, using the correct date, address, and data formats, adapting to local regulations, interface and skin adjustments, etc. The object of localization is the “product”, not just the “text”; this process also includes two aspects: language and culture (including social background).</p>
<p>In the localization of game products, the process is, in a sense, a re-creation of the game content (such as character image). There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes. Even people in the same language environment cannot reach a consensus on the same thing, and it is even more difficult for people in different languages and regions to have the same understanding of the same thing. Therefore, in addition to the character image created by the original language, the shaping of the character image by the target language is particularly important.</p>
<p>A successful re-creation of the character image must be an indispensable part of successful localization. However, while re-creating the character image, the localization process must not deviate from the original image of the character (that is, the character image in the original language). This is because localization not only needs to meet the requirements of the target market, but also needs to carry the information of the original language and the original game itself. In this way, how to shape a “new image” that is close to the character’s original image becomes a problem. This is a challenge of “dancing in shackles”, and it is also an opportunity to gain both overseas market revenue and the inheritance of national culture.</p>
<h2 id="2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture"><a href="#2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture"></a>2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture</h2><h3 id="Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits"><a href="#Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits"></a>Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits</h3><p>The localization of the language itself is often understood as localization translation, which is only one aspect. When it comes to the standards of Chinese people for translation, it is impossible to avoid Yan Fu’s “faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance” mentioned in “Evolution and Ethics”. In the process of localizing the background, plot, lines, etc. related to the character image, this standard will also be referred to. “Faithfulness means truth, and truth means non-falsehood; expressiveness means attainment, and attainment means neither excess nor deficiency; elegance means literariness, and literariness means being elegant when it should be elegant and being vulgar when it should be vulgar.”</p>
<p>Lawrence Venuti put forward the concepts of domestication and foreignization in his book <em>The Translator’s Invisibility: A History of Translation</em>. Domestication emphasizes reducing the sense of strangeness in the target language, while foreignization preserves the exotic elements in the original language.</p>
<p>In language localization, if you want to ensure that the character image is close to the prototype, you must first ensure the correctness of the language itself, including no grammatical errors, no deviations in word interpretation. This is the basis of all localization and translation. If the foundation is not strong, the character image on the upper level will also shake. After ensuring the correctness of the language itself, what needs to be done is “expressiveness”, neither excess nor deficiency.</p>
<p>In the current era of big data, with the help of AI translation and the excellent quality monitoring of the localization team, the correctness and quality of the language can be well guaranteed in most cases and scenarios, so “faithfulness” and “expressiveness” are no longer difficult.</p>
<p>The final “elegance” is the key factor that determines whether a localization result is of high quality in this era. How to analyze, discuss, and reshape the style, usage habits, and the character image behind the original language, and apply it to the target language, so that the target language population (that is, game players in countries and regions that use the target language) can feel that the translated language is not awkward, then it can be called a successful localization.</p>
<p>For example, in the Japanese original of <em>Blue Archive</em>, Iori calls Aiko “アコちゃん”, which is often translated as “A-ko chan” in anime scenarios, but the localization team of the simplified Chinese version translated it as “Aya”(亚亚). Obviously, the localization here removes the influence of Japanese usage habits without reducing Iori’s original intimacy with the members of the Gehenna Prefect Team. This localized translation even reminds people of the names of giant pandas, which has a strong Chinese flavor. In a sense, it can be called a successful localization attempt. </p>

<h3 id="Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors"><a href="#Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors"></a>Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors</h3><p>Cultural localization is different from language localization. If language localization requires the character image to be as close as possible to the target language user group, then cultural localization requires the character image to maintain a certain distance from the target group in some aspects. In our view, we must provide players with a reason to play our games.</p>
<p>Why would a player in a country choose not to play their own country’s games, but to choose a game from a foreign manufacturer? There can be many reasons for this, such as rich gameplay&#x2F;playability, extremely high picture quality, vivid story background&#x2F;character plot, comprehensive user service, etc. Of course, many players themselves are only loyal to the game category and overall quality, and do not care about the developer’s region. However, in the world of games, which highly emphasizes subjective user experience, how to enter the player’s mind is decisive. At this time, if a game can bring players a foreign cultural experience that starts with curiosity and ends with dissemination, it can clearly distinguish this game from other games; and it is this differentiation that can make a game from a foreign country for players stand out. At this time, the character image should be closer to the background story of the original language, rather than the environment of the target language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230904/04f8d0ab-8f9a-4886-9659-6ab5b04698eb.png"></p>
<p>For example, in the preheating story of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Yoto Hime, there is such a passage: “Beast?” The girl seemed to have heard something very interesting, and couldn’t help laughing softly.</p>
<p>The first version of the Japanese translation was: 「ペット？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>However, considering that <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is based on a fictional ancient Chinese fantasy and martial arts world, the word ペット in Japanese is derived from the English word pet, which reflects the epitome of English’s influence in the world. Therefore, after consideration, we changed this passage to:</p>
<p>「飼い犬？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>Here, 飼い犬 is often translated as a domestic dog, which is closer to the Eastern worldview of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> than pet, and the character image of Yoto Hime in this worldview can be better shaped. Indeed, in terms of language usage habits, for Japanese people, the word pet is more commonly used and more everyday than domestic dog. But as mentioned above, how can a game localization that cannot be distinguished from other games and cannot bring players a sense of foreign culture break through the vast game market today? Therefore, the localization process here must follow the principle of foreignization of historical and cultural factors to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Looking back, the translation of “Aya” in <em>Blue Archive</em> mentioned above does achieve language localization, but it seems to have eliminated most of the cultural perception of anime, which may bring some players a sense of separation between the picture and the characters.</p>
<h2 id="3-Successful-Localization-Cases"><a href="#3-Successful-Localization-Cases" class="headerlink" title="3. Successful Localization Cases"></a>3. Successful Localization Cases</h2><p>How do successful cases make the character image more popular with the local audience through localization? Here are some examples of Japanese localization and translation to better understand the two key points of shaping the character image: domestication of language usage habits and foreignization of historical and cultural factors.</p>
<p>Yoto Hime of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is portrayed in the game as a princess&#x2F;lady whose underlying logic is to find “fun”. Therefore, there are a lot of Japanese final particles (language usage habits) such as わ, よ, かしら, じゃない in the script to reflect this princess persona. The following is also a passage from Yoto Hime’s preheating story:</p>
<p>“He said yesterday that he never believed in ghosts and gods. I wanted to see if it was true~ Who knew that it would be amazing once I tried. I can’t really accept him as a disciple, so I had to let this beggar receive his bows for me.”</p>
<p>「あの奴、昨日自分で言ったでしょ、鬼神の説を信じていないって。だから本当かどうかを見てみたいわ。試した結果、大変なことになっちゃったわよ。ほら、私は彼を本当に弟子にするのもいかないし、物乞いくんに拝礼を受けてもらうしかないわ。」</p>
<p>However, in the first version of the preheating story, this persona was only reflected in Yoto Hime’s actions in the plot, and her unique style was not shown in her lines. After discussion by the localization team, these simple modal final particles were finally added according to Yoto Hime’s persona in the script, shaping Yoto Hime who is close to the original persona at the language level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230904/3ed77793-f22e-4be9-a882-87b723f15344.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In all the above examples, it seems that the localization discusses and纠结s over only one or two words or pronunciations. In fact, whether it is the image of a character, or the game background and world created by various characters, and even the entire game, will be affected by these seemingly insignificant, accumulated details. The character image reshaped by localization must show the characteristics of being close to the original language but not rigid, and being compatible with the target language but vivid in insignificant places.</p>
<p>Therefore, in localization work, the more insignificant the place, the more effort should be made to ensure the rigor of the localization work. Although the behavior of the character itself is ever-changing, the behavioral logic behind the character should be consistent, and the identity of the character we create should also be the same and continuous. The consistency of the appropriate expression of the same thing between different languages is also something we should firmly grasp.</p>
