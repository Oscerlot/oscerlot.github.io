<p>Text in games runs through the core gameplay and functional interfaces at all levels. The information transmission and emotional expression it achieves are key elements in game interaction. This article analyzes the characteristics of font design in excellent game works at home and abroad under different themes, and discusses how to choose the basic tone of fonts and the integration of font design and game worldview according to the style of different games. In addition, we will also explain the relevant information about game font localization and commercial costs. These contents are intended to provide game developers with ideas and references for font selection and design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Font-Classification"><a href="#1-Font-Classification" class="headerlink" title="1. Font Classification"></a>1. Font Classification</h2><p>There are many ways to classify fonts, such as handwriting, printing, and artistic fonts… etc. The most discussed classification method is “serif and sans-serif”. In layman’s terms, serifs are also known as “feet”. Serif fonts are fonts with corner decorations. As can be clearly seen from the figure below, at the same font size, the angular sans-serif font looks larger and clearer than the serif font. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F74e0f603-d52b-494c-9f8f-140a84d15820.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1. Comparison of Serif and Sans-serif Fonts</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Serif"><a href="#Serif" class="headerlink" title="Serif"></a>Serif</h3><p>It is generally believed that serif fonts originated from Roman stone inscriptions. The modern explanation for these decorative strokes, which is accepted by most people, comes from Father Edward Catich’s book “The Origin of the Serif”. The book believes that Roman letters were first written with a square-tipped brush before being carved into stone tablets. Due to the use of a square-tipped brush, the strokes would have uneven strokes at the beginning and end, so finishing actions were added at the beginning, end, and corners of the strokes. The engravers carved according to the written samples, which naturally formed the “serif” serif font.</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese characters, such as Song typeface, at the junction of strokes, the beginning of vertical strokes and the end of horizontal strokes, due to the return and pause of the brush when writing calligraphy, a unique triangular structure is formed, which can also be called “serif”.</p>
<h3 id="Sans-serif"><a href="#Sans-serif" class="headerlink" title="Sans-serif"></a>Sans-serif</h3><p>In the era of electronic screens, the display of Chinese characters does not need the original function of “serif” but only retains its decorative nature. However, in the case of a large amount of text information input&#x2F;output on the Internet, too many embellishments on the strokes of serif fonts can easily cause visual fatigue. Sans-serif fonts, contrary to serif fonts, have no decorative lines or small horizontal lines similar to “small feet” in their glyphs, and the text is usually composed of mechanical and uniform lines.</p>
<p>There is no unified rule when choosing fonts, but there are some default norms. For example, long-form reading or small-screen information displays prefer to use sans-serif fonts; while titles or small-scale texts prefer serif fonts to enhance the beauty of short sentences. Moreover, in many scenarios, more irregular artistic fonts are needed to render the atmosphere of the game or achieve specific effects.</p>
<h2 id="2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="2. Selection of Game Fonts"></a>2. Selection of Game Fonts</h2><h3 id="Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone"><a href="#Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Game Style Determines the Basic Tone"></a>Game Style Determines the Basic Tone</h3><p>In the selection and design of game fonts, it is necessary to consider the game style, type, main audience, and the good integration within the different systems in the game and the game worldview. However, there are many ways to classify game styles, and it is difficult to find a specific classification method to cover all game types and styles. Here, some examples with obvious contrasts are used to illustrate the differences in the form of different fonts and the selection principles.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay type, games that are more mysterious and magical usually prefer serif fonts, while action games that emphasize fast pace and dynamism will prefer sans-serif fonts to reflect a crisp power; Chinese style games and styles that are more realistic and nostalgic always prefer serif fonts to create a real, profound and immersive atmosphere; while sci-fi and anime games emphasize exploration and technology, and choosing sans-serif fonts will be more compatible with them; for children’s games, cartoon and simple sans-serif fonts are usually the first choice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Fb69f3fab-2b2e-4f3e-b712-fc3c6a2d4900.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 2. Different style classifications of games and the types of fonts that can be selected</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If the worldview of the game has not been determined during the design process, you can initially choose a suitable basic font tone by combining the keyword list provided in the figure below. Generally speaking, sans-serif fonts are suitable for modern, concise, technological and other game styles; while serif fonts are more suitable for traditional, ancient, Gothic fantasy and other game styles. There is no clear boundary for the selection of fonts. On the basis of ensuring information transmission, it is often pursued to create a visual performance effect that is more in line with the game worldview. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Fb87fd352-5e34-4c39-8718-a2ade52a46ad.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. Correspondence between game style keywords and font selection recommendations</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, choosing sans-serif or serif as the main font of the game does not mean that all text content in the game is immutable. There are also various font classifications in the game, and it is often necessary to mix and use multiple fonts.</p>
<h3 id="System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts"><a href="#System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="System Fonts and Artistic Fonts"></a>System Fonts and Artistic Fonts</h3><p>Whether it is a serif font or a sans-serif font, it needs to be authorized before it can be legally used as the system font of the game. Due to the size and compression restrictions of the game package, too many fonts cannot be placed in the game, and usually one font is selected for each of the title font and the system font. However, it would be a bit monotonous if all the text in the game only uses the system font, so developers need to make a trade-off in the use of fonts.</p>
<p>In order to meet some special needs in the game, such as event titles, game names, etc., developers may need to use some artistic fonts or handwritten fonts. Artistic fonts are sometimes deformations and modifications of existing fonts, and sometimes they are more complex changes; while handwritten fonts are usually more natural, softer, and more stylized, and sometimes designed by professional calligraphers.</p>
<p>So, how should we choose system fonts or artistic fonts? We should consider the role of text in the game. Text with different functions will have different designs and processing methods. In general, the fewer types of fonts used in game interface design, the better. As much as possible, visual hierarchy principles, such as different weights, styles, sizes, directions, positions, and colors of fonts, should be used to reflect differences in importance.</p>
<h3 id="Integration-with-the-In-Game-World"><a href="#Integration-with-the-In-Game-World" class="headerlink" title="Integration with the In-Game World"></a>Integration with the In-Game World</h3><p>● <strong>Main System Font - Integration</strong></p>
<p>The system fonts in the game, such as game menus, game situation, task information, etc., as a strong functional existence, provide players with a series of main information such as character data, items, levels, and task objectives. Part of this information will always appear on the main game interface, such as the game’s HUD (Heads-up Display). The display of another part of the information involves interaction with other functional controls or changes in interaction levels. In both cases, designers need to think about how to integrate the text in the game with other visual hierarchy structures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F249f97c7-1195-49ff-9ec3-73511413039b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4. Precautions and examples of game system font design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Designers often simplify the text information in the game HUD to make the most important information or functions visually visible. However, when players open the menu bar and other secondary interfaces, they often need to read and digest a large amount of data information at one time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F48cf773a-997b-4907-8943-e86c7865292d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5. HUD design considerations and case sharing</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When page level jumps or Tab switching is required, in order to avoid a blunt transition between the scene interface and the text interface, usually not only the font itself is used to match the style, but different dynamic effects, display styles, art packaging, and font effect designs are used to add visual effects. In the selection of fonts, it is necessary to make subtle distinctions based on primary and secondary information, but it should not be too fragmented. This can create a more coherent and harmonious gaming experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F15557e12-fea6-4828-847d-af4a17ee3ac3.png/size/"></p>

<p>● <strong>Subtitles and Dialogue - Role Immersion</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle text is an indispensable part of games with storylines. It can play a role in promoting the plot and helping players enter the role. The design of subtitles needs to avoid stealing the limelight of the picture, and at the same time, it needs to ensure that the font is clear and visible. This requires that the font should not be too compact or too small to increase the difficulty of reading and understanding, and at the same time, it should not be too long or occupy too much space, so as not to affect the advancement of the game plot and the immersive experience of the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F52f7c7d8-97ac-4bfb-8f50-1dabda9fbe42.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 7. Precautions and examples of game dialogue and subtitle design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Posters and Packaging - Brand Impression</strong></p>
<p>Using the system default font can meet the text needs on the conventional interface, but it is slightly inferior to some special occasions that require exaggerated design font effects. The game logo and promotional posters are important identifiers of the game brand, and are the first impression of a game. They need to clearly convey the core concept and characteristics of the game, and at the same time, they should also provide players with a reference standard for the overall tone of the game. Many game logos consist only of the game name, which requires that they cannot be too complicated, otherwise it will increase the difficulty of memory, and at the same time, they need to be highly stylized. In addition, when designing, it is also necessary to consider the logo changes in different languages to ensure that the game has better awareness and playability in different regions and cultures.</p>
<p>At this time, we need to use custom fonts, which are what we often call artistic fonts. Artistic fonts require artists to make a separate picture text and paste it in a designated position to replace the traditional text. This picture text often contains exaggerated deformation of the original font, adding a unique style and avoiding infringement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Ff10ee232-56ad-48d7-af00-2f2b21879769.png/size/"></p>

<p>● <strong>Core Gameplay Font - Motivation and Ritual</strong></p>
<p>In the design of core gameplay, how to balance a large amount of related information and the display of main information is very important. In the case of a fast-paced core gameplay, it is necessary to first clarify the importance of information grading, and select the corresponding game font style and arrangement method according to different gradings. In addition, in the core gameplay, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of non-static factors such as dynamic effects and scenes on the transmission of text information, so as to better convey information.</p>
<p>Almost all games have initialization and settlement settings. How to stimulate the player’s motivation and sense of ritual, and provide just the right sense of frustration when necessary, so that they can re-challenge the task, is a key issue that interface designers need to focus on. The font design at this time often pursues the first-time instinctive perception of information, rather than the content conveyed by the text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F3f494623-94cf-4ab8-b423-88407feeca26.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Figure 9. Precautions and examples of game core gameplay information transmission design</em></p>

<p>● <strong>Summary - Balance of Readability and Stylization</strong></p>
<p>Through the analysis of this section, it can be found that the main goals of different types of fonts in the game to transmit information are also different. The selection of the overall game font needs to pay attention to the balance of readability and stylization.</p>
<p>For the system fonts in the game, the primary goal is to clearly convey information. At this time, it is necessary to focus on improving readability and legibility without affecting the continuity of the player’s operation and causing a lack of immersion.</p>
<p>For the artistic fonts in the game, it is more to highlight the personality of the game, attract the attention, recognition and interest of players. The readability of these artistic fonts is not always the higher the better. Sometimes appropriately weakening the font content and strengthening its visual impact, achieving the integration of text information and dynamic effects, etc., can deepen the player’s immersion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fonts in the game also need to follow certain principles. For example, in game design, information at the same level needs to be unified in terms of font size, color, font shape, and font style to reduce the user’s identification and cognitive burden. In addition, the legibility and usability of the font are very important. Doing this well can avoid causing reading or operation obstacles to the player, affecting the fluency of the game experience, and thus making more contributions to retention.</p>
<h2 id="3-Game-Font-Localization"><a href="#3-Game-Font-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3. Game Font Localization"></a>3. Game Font Localization</h2><p>When different readers see this article, the display font comes from your specific system, and the system font libraries of different platforms often differ, which will lead to differences in the reading experience of the same product on different platforms. For a product like a game that focuses on the overall experience, calling the fonts of the system platform sometimes has two problems:</p>
<p>● In a single-language system, if localization is not performed, it may cause the font to fail to display, rare fonts to be missing or garbled, etc., destroying the original beauty of the interface, affecting understanding, and causing players to lose immersion.</p>
<p>● When it comes to multi-language systems, it is necessary to ensure that the selected font is equipped with a complete character set for each language and can be presented in a clear and aesthetically pleasing way. Localization at this time not only needs to consider the accuracy of the translation, but also needs to consider the impact of factors such as market development, user habits, cultural and religious differences on the acceptance of the product.</p>
<p>This article only discusses the problem of inconsistent font display. The solution to this problem is to copy the font to the project and let the engine support reading the font from its own project, so that the platform difference can be eliminated and the design effect can be displayed consistently on all platforms. This is the current solution for various game engines. Some game studios may produce or purchase new system fonts for specific regions to meet the needs of different language regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F91df51ac-2461-4476-8d64-8869dc75f4bd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 10. Localization problems and solutions currently faced</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For designers, there are two aspects of font localization that are worth thinking about:</p>
<p>● For special language symbols, it is necessary to consider the production method of picture words and the replacement under different languages, and pay attention to the possible changes in size and estimated distance, and provide a consistent and complete game experience on different types of devices.</p>
<p>● When arranging text such as tabs or titles, fully consider the impact of different language habits on the visual effect. For example, a vertical arrangement that can be clearly displayed in Chinese or Japanese may not be suitable for Western languages. The writing style of Arabic is from right to left, and it is necessary to consider the arrangement and alignment in special cases, and also to consider the impact of the differences in reading habits of different players on the game experience.</p>
<p>As game development progresses rapidly, many designers are committed to solving these problems, so many excellent developer plugins have emerged, such as the Unity plugin “ThunderFire UX Tool”. ThunderFire UX Tool localization tool supports the configuration and content replacement of 14 languages including Thai and Arabic. It can import and identify multi-language text and artistic font pictures with one click, and can quickly preview and switch in the editor, providing a complete set of procedural localization and font solutions for interaction, translation, and programming. </p>

<h2 id="4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts"></a>4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts</h2><p>When choosing game fonts, commercial costs usually include design, licensing, and maintenance costs. Developers need to budget and plan within a reasonable range and comply with relevant licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Game font licensing is usually divided into two types: game image licensing and game embedding. Game image licensing applies the image form of the font to game software or poster products, the price is relatively low, and the frequency of use is low. Game embedding is to embed the font as a whole into the game system as a system font, and the price is higher. Game embedding needs to meet more usage specifications and requirements, including the stability and compatibility of the font in the game system. The licensing price will also vary according to the completeness of the font family package and the national standard type.</p>
<p>The specific licensing price will also be affected by the font design itself, such as the exquisiteness of the font, the copyright period, popularity, and aesthetics. Therefore, when conducting font licensing, developers need to fully communicate and negotiate with the font licensor to determine a reasonable licensing price and usage method, and scope of application.</p>
<p>When borrowing unlicensed fonts, it is necessary to pay attention to the deformation of the fonts to avoid violating relevant agreements. When it is necessary to use fonts similar to picture fonts in the game, fonts with very large deformations are often used to make artistic fonts to increase the aesthetics and reduce the risk of use.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>For game players, excellent font selection and design can allow players to easily understand the text information in the game without causing doubts. Sometimes, the player’s ignorance of the text in the game can reflect the success of the text design. Developers choosing the right font not only needs to consider the coordination of the game’s worldview and the overall style of the game, but also needs to consider multi-dimensional issues such as font iteration authorization and localization to enhance the quality and user experience of the game.</p>
