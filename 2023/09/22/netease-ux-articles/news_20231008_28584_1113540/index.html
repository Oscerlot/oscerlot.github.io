<p>&nbsp;<br>With the maturity of product design and manufacturers’ development capabilities, users are increasingly paying attention to the emotional experience that products bring to them. At the same time, more and more games are not only pursuing momentary excitement, pure visual and operational experience, but also fully considering and satisfying users’ emotional needs as much as possible, and are more pursuing users’ spiritual pleasure, value and emotional recognition. This article will start from the perspective of emotional design, explore its role and application methods in the field of game experience design, in order to optimize user experience through emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Emotional-Design"><a href="#1-What-is-Emotional-Design" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Emotional Design?"></a>1. What is Emotional Design?</h2><p>Emotions are complex and changeable, but the patterns that cause emotions are general and regular; and emotional design is to use these patterns to purposefully cause people’s emotional reactions, through various shapes, colors, textures and other modeling elements, emotions are integrated into the game experience, in the process of consumers experiencing products, to stimulate people’s associations, resonate, and obtain spiritual pleasure and emotional satisfaction.</p>
<p>Emotion is a mandatory and oppressive experience. Converting consumers’ activities, thoughts, feelings, desires, goals, habits, and values into design will trigger positive emotional responses from users. The book “Emotional Design” clearly divides design and design goals into three levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective, and expounds the important position and role of emotion in design. It serves as a conceptual supplement in the fields of software, interaction, and game design. Therefore, when we design any product, we need to respect emotional needs and bring a deeper level of quality experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

The Role of Emotional Design in Experience Design</h2><h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Visceral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Visceral Experience</h3><p>The visceral level refers to the sensory stimulation that the product brings to people. The emotional response that the product looks, sounds, and feels to the user is the first step for design to generate value. Through the design of pictures, colors, layouts, sounds, textures, and tactile feedback, the product features can be visually reflected and bring specific emotional experiences to users.</p>
<p>For example, the beautiful pictures in the game make people feel dazzling and colorful, or red reminds people of blood, sun, and fire, giving people a feeling of excitement, jumping, and alertness, causing physiological excitement and stimulation. These are all visceral designs of the game that are acting on the visual experience of players.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience</h3><p>The behavioral level refers to the fact that users must learn and master skills, use skills to solve problems, and trigger emotions, gain a sense of accomplishment and pleasure from the experience. It is aimed at the user’s experience. For example, in the game, players need to gradually master the game rules preset by the designer, and use them to fight against other players or computer opponents to strive for victory. The experience of the behavioral layer is the core of game interaction design, which can allow users to obtain a positive emotional experience. Therefore, it is necessary to provide clear goals, instant feedback, and appropriate challenges; it is necessary to design an easy-to-understand conceptual model that conforms to the four elements of function, ease of understanding, ease of use, and physical feeling of behavioral design, so that users can use it easily, and always pay attention to the user’s experience throughout the process.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Reflective Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Reflective Experience</h3><p>Finally, there is the reflective layer, which refers to the deeper emotions, consciousness, understanding, personal experience, cultural background and other influences that are intertwined in the user’s heart due to the effects of the first two levels, the user transforms and associates certain potential information and characteristics contained in things, and projects them into life experience. For games, the content of the game and the implied information conveyed by the storyline will stimulate players to recall and reflect, integrating out-of-game experience and in-game feelings to create a more immersive experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The experience brought to users by excellent reflective emotional design determines the connotation, meaning and user stickiness of the product; when the emotional experience meets the user’s long-term goals and conveys a clear and consistent personality, it is more likely that users will truly like such an experience in a meaningful way, and voluntarily and actively form a lasting and loyal connection with the brand or IP.</p>

How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience"></a>3. How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience</h2><h3 id="Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience"><a href="#Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience"></a>Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience</h3><p>At the visceral level, physical characteristics—visual, auditory, and tactile—dominate, so creating visual, auditory, and tactile appeal is an important factor in getting users’ favor and attracting users’ attention at the visceral level of the game.</p>
<p>So how to create multi-sensory appeal?</p>
<p>Designers can refine relevant characteristic elements, such as regional characteristics, character characteristics, etc., to expand the game from pure senses and aesthetics to the fields of semantics and culture, occupy users’ cognitive resources at the visceral level, guide users’ emotions, and attract users’ attention. Among them, vision, as the most basic perception channel, is the beginning of the user’s game experience. Using characteristic elements familiar to users can stimulate users’ “value resonance”, thereby affecting the generation of immersive emotional experience.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>All-Star Streetball Party</em>, the exquisite interface design incorporates a large number of street basketball elements. From the personalized graffiti-style interface to the cool and trendy sneakers and fashions, these elements contain the collective memory of basketball fans and can also attract general users who are interested in streetball culture. These elements can quickly occupy users’ cognitive resources from the visual channel, arouse associations and imagination, activate users’ sensory systems, and attract users’ attention at the visceral level.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Sound evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>For a game, sound is also an important way for players to obtain information and emotions. Try to recall a game you like. Whether it attracts you with exciting battles, beautiful scenes, or touching plots, it is inseparable from the support and enhancement of sound: background music allows players to feel the changes in scenes and environments, skill sound effects allow players to feel the pleasure of battle, and character voices allow players to feel the personality and emotions of the characters. The sound of the game should be consistent with the style and color of the game, and be varied in different scenes or stages, so that the game’s worldview and the user’s perception are seamlessly integrated, reducing the user’s sense of alienation during the experience.</p>
<p>For example, in the fast-paced battle of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players tend to focus on the center of the screen and it is difficult to notice changes in edge UI elements, such as the countdown to skill cooldown. At this time, sound and sound effects can play a very good feedback role: clicking on a skill in cooldown can be informed that your skill is in cooldown through the feedback sound effect of the empty state; when the skill cooldown ends, there is also a corresponding sound effect reminder of skill recovery.</p>
<p>In addition, the various background music in the game, and even the design of UGC instrument composition music, will also bring players a new emotional experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The gameplay of musical instruments in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is also diverse, making good use of music to promote interaction and communication between players.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb4588e45-d0c7-4789-90e9-2a4039d02f8b.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Similarly, the “Crystal Prelude” of “Final Fantasy” is one of the most classic melodies in the history of games. The core melody of this prelude has become an important part of almost every “Final Fantasy”. The “Crystal Prelude” adapted by composer Masayoshi Soken for “Final Fantasy XIV” is a brisk melody that makes people look forward to the upcoming fantasy journey; while in “Final Fantasy XVI”, it uses dark music to foreshadow the suffering that Clive will endure, suggesting to players the dark and heavy plot experience on the auditory level.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F2d9b8746-bc10-44da-8aa0-d993a8f09627.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Touch evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, as part of visceral emotional design, touch can help improve the playability and fun of the game, making players more immersed in the game. The control in the game is the most direct way of contact between the player and the game. Through fine control feedback, players can feel the authenticity and tension in the game.</p>
<p>In the expression of touch, the greatest extent of tactile expression we can currently achieve is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller. For example, in the racing game <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the controller will simulate the vibration effect of car collisions and impacts, allowing players to feel the danger and tension of the car driving at high speed. In addition, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some heroes’ ultimate skills, successful parries, the second stage of bow charging, being hit by ground gas, and when the stamina is reduced to a red warning, will also trigger controller vibration.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience"><a href="#Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience"></a>Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience</h3><p>Enhancing the emotional connection between users and the game world through interaction can bring users a pleasant game experience at the behavioral level, thereby allowing users to further immerse themselves in it. Specifically, the immersive emotional experience at the behavioral level can enable users to more focusedly accept the information transmission in the game, cleverly stimulate users’ unconscious behaviors, and increase the playability of the game. In order to make the game more naturally guide the occurrence of user behavior at the behavioral level and complete the emotional communication between the game and the player, the technique of empathy can be used.</p>
<p>The so-called empathy is to use anthropomorphism, symbolism, metaphor and other methods to design the interface or emotional symbols in the game, give meaning to abstract UI controls, inject emotion into cold virtual graphics, connect the virtual world on the screen with the real world, and build psychological resonance through similar relationships, so that users can quickly adapt to the new context and integrate into the game atmosphere expected by the designer.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<hr>
<p><em>In “All-Star Streetball Party”, the card drawing is packaged as a “supply box”, which is in line with the game’s worldview and helps players understand and use it</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in the retro and avant-garde Internet world constructed in <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, the game designer replaced the hand under the first-person perspective in the game with a thumbs-up gesture or a mouse arrow. By metaphor, the space in the browser is turned into something similar to the physical world, showing the contradiction between the network world and the real world, and bringing players unexpected game experience at the behavioral level with the clever design of interaction.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Clear-Goals-Appropriate-Challenges-and-Immediate-Feedback"><a href="#Clear-Goals-Appropriate-Challenges-and-Immediate-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Clear Goals, Appropriate Challenges, and Immediate Feedback"></a>Clear Goals, Appropriate Challenges, and Immediate Feedback</h3><p>The emotional design of the behavioral layer increases the player’s emotional experience by designing the player’s behavior and interaction, and the conceptual model of the behavioral layer design is inseparable from clear goals, appropriate challenges, and immediate feedback. Will Wright, the designer of “The Sims”, said: “Games can bring people different emotional experiences, which are the pride or guilt that they have never felt when watching movies.” From the perspective of interaction, in game experience design, by combining the above three game design elements, creating attractive experiences with clear strategies and skills can better improve the emotional experience of the game.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> does not have the clear task guidance of traditional RPG games, but players have an extremely immersive game experience. The reason is the clear exploration goals in the game. The game designs a multi-layered map system that is interconnected and independent of each other at the interaction level, so that the map expands the space for vertical exploration and is more exploratory; and, the guidance design that can be seen everywhere in the open world adds a spiral upward light vortex to the shrine, which is convenient for players to easily find even at high places. In the dark underground world, the shimmer of tree roots becomes the only visible beacon, hinting at various resources, landscapes, and enemies in the dark.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>For games, the difficulty setting of the game itself determines what kind of experience it can bring to players. If it is too simple, it will be boring, and if it is too complicated, it will make people feel anxious. The setting of the game should allow players to be in a challenging range in real time, and the skills required are also constantly improving. In addition to the aforementioned roguelike games and Soulslike games, the emergence of emergent interaction (涌现式交互 - yǒng xiàn shì jiāo hù) also gives the game new fun and challenges, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors, perfectly matching the players’ emotional needs for high freedom and high playability.</p>
<p>The excellent game experience of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> inherits the emergent interaction gene of the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> series, that is, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors. For example, in a certain dungeon, there is a chess game that requires the player to kill the black king within three steps. Even if the player does not understand the rules of chess at all, he will find that the black king is weak to electricity and can directly kill the king with electric spells. Like this, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> builds a world with infinite possibilities through the design of the underlying system rules. The integration of emergent interaction also greatly enhances the fun and spread of the game.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>For emotional experience, feedback is a stabilizer and amplifier, stabilizing uneasy emotions and amplifying pleasant feelings. The game system itself is a complex system. Players input their ideas and controls, and through the processing of the game mechanism, they give feedback to the players. Players get the feedback they want and the appropriate degree, and they are more likely to continue to be in pleasure.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>The teammate feedback mechanism in “Overwatch” extends from a single human-computer interaction feedback to human-to-human interaction feedback.</em></p>

Summary</h2><p>Emotional design focuses on influencing the user’s emotions and moods from three different levels, enhances the appeal of the design, endows the product with a deeper soul, thereby building a bridge between the user and the product to communicate with the soul, allowing people to obtain unforgettable memories and sublimating the value of design to a higher level.</p>
<p>Games are not only tools for entertainment and recreation, they also have the potential to evoke emotions and touch hearts, and through visceral sensory effects, empathy, game interaction mechanisms and storylines, etc., to trigger players’ emotional resonance and create a rich game experience. We have also made a more in-depth dismantling of the relationship between games and emotional design. With the continuous development of the game industry, emotional design will continue to play an important role in game experience, creating unforgettable emotional experiences for players.</p>
