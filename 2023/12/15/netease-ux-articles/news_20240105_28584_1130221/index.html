<h2 id="1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games"><a href="#1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?"></a>1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?</h2><p>The concept of “main game, secondary game” has been around for quite some time, mainly because the content design of some games on the market greatly reduces the burden on players, allowing them to experience the game content flexibly, saving them worry and effort.</p>
<p>In this way, players who like to watch live broadcasts will also find that many game streamers open some casual games (such as <em>Dou Dizhu</em>) while waiting for matchmaking. On the one hand, the matchmaking waiting time is indeed too long, and they can’t just wait. On the other hand, it can also add some effect to the live broadcast and interact with fans. This is not a phenomenon unique to live broadcast rooms. Many players will also play a round of <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> while resting after playing <em>DOTA</em>.</p>
<p>Many players will play multiple games at the same time, and the concept of “main game” and “secondary game” has gradually become popular. Sometimes it’s even “a solid secondary game, a flowing main game”. Main games and secondary games may not be specifically distinguished at the beginning, but are divided according to the time and energy invested. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, the game is large and there is a lot of content to explore; and as the player’s level increases and gradually unlocks guilds, homes, etc., a sense of belonging will gradually develop. Over time, while playing other games, they will also subconsciously set aside a certain amount of time for this game; while in comparison, secondary games focus more on the immediate feeling. </p>

<p>So, are all “lightweight games” “secondary games”?</p>
<p>Obviously not. The so-called main and secondary games have nothing to do with the game category itself, but are a relative concept. For each player, they can have their own “main game” and “secondary game”. Generally speaking, secondary games often have the following relative characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less time spent:</strong> On average, players spend less time and energy in this game than in other main games they play.</li>
<li><strong>Less economic expenditure:</strong> For most players, the investment of money is often proportional to the love of the game. This is also true for buyout games. Players are willing to pay for better-made games, and they are also willing to collect different versions of games for their feelings, even if this requires repeated expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Less emotional investment:</strong> Players of many games will spontaneously become “volunteers” for their favorite games, giving good reviews, promoting, and vigorously promoting the game. Those who are capable will also “generate electricity with love” and create more derivative products related to the game. However, players generally do not invest in this level of effort for secondary games.</li>
<li><strong>More single game goal:</strong> Secondary games often only meet a part of the player’s most core game experience needs, rather than meeting multiple needs at once.</li>
<li><strong>Weaker social connections:</strong> Except for some secondary games that are only experienced for social reasons, most players invest less time, energy, and emotion in experiencing secondary games, and hardly establish complex social relationships outside of experiencing the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?"></a>2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous section, secondary games often meet a certain part of the player’s game experience needs. Conversely, games that can simultaneously meet multiple core game experiences of players are more likely to become the main games that players invest in for a long time. This is also the fundamental reason why many games continue to expand gameplay, polish game content, and improve game experience: to attract and retain more players.</p>
<p>In the realm of philosophy, it is mentioned that in the process of things developing, the principal contradiction is in a dominant position, regulating or influencing other contradictions. As for game selection, when players find that one of their needs can be better matched with a certain game, they may choose to experience a secondary game.</p>
<p>For example, after a player experiences an extremely intense ranked match, “rest and relaxation” becomes their most urgent need; when waiting in line and not knowing when they will be called, what the player needs is a game that “starts and plays immediately, and will not be penalized for quitting”; on a train shuttling between mountains, “not afraid of lag” is the player’s most basic appeal; at a multiplayer offline party, friends enthusiastically invite, even if they don’t like this type of game, they will be willing to play with friends… At different times, players choose secondary games with different standards, but they are all closely related to the current needs. When these restrictions are no longer present, players will still return to their main game, because they have invested more energy here and can get more of the game experience they need.</p>
<p>This also causes the player’s main and secondary games to change or even switch over time. Students have more entertainment time and can spend more time completing daily tasks, “replacing krypton with liver”; and after entering the working state, time becomes precious, and they need to “spend money to buy time”.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More"><a href="#3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?"></a>3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?</h2><p>The market for secondary games is pioneering. Everyone’s time and energy are limited, and it is unrealistic to try to make players experience multiple main games at the same time. Although secondary games mean that players invest less, but many small amounts add up. Many games have gained a good reputation for their excellent quality and precise user insights. For example, <em>Tabi Kaeru (Travel Frog)</em>, launched in 2017, made many players keen to “raise a frog son”, and ranked first on the App Store China free game list without an official Chinese version. In many cases, the competitors of secondary games are not only other games, but also all things that will attract users’ attention. </p>

<p>How to make players more willing to experience a secondary game? We can learn a thing or two from the design of many hyper-casual games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to learn, simple to operate:</strong> A low game entry threshold can help the game be accessed and mastered by a wider range of players. Common gameplays of hyper-casual games such as puzzles, synthesis, stacking, racing, etc., players can almost learn at a glance and master the core gameplay in a short time. The operating frequency in the game is not high, the requirements for the player’s instantaneous response are low, or automatic pathfinding, automatic combat, and other methods are used;</li>
<li><strong>Small levels, short process:</strong> During the game process, players are not required to have high concentration and do not need to keep staring at the screen. Make full use of fragmented time, players can open the game anytime, anywhere, and there is no strict end time point, and the experience of entering and leaving is relatively smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Simple numerical design:</strong> The in-game cycle is relatively direct, and the acquisition and consumption paths of currency&#x2F;props are clear. However, simple values do not necessarily mean that the game has no depth and is abandoned after 1 hour. Through algorithms, many games can automatically generate hundreds of levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are some experiences that can provide inspiration for our design of secondary games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance to the main game:</strong> <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> uses the worldview, races, heroes, skills, and equipment system settings of <em>DOTA</em>, so that DOTA players can naturally get started with the game quickly and are more willing to stay in it, which plays a good supplementary role with some players’ main game <em>DOTA</em>;</li>
<li><strong>Reduced burden of daily tasks:</strong> There is no need for complicated login and task systems to tie up players’ time. Players can take some time to experience the game content for a period of time at one time, and it is not mandatory to go online every day or every hour;</li>
<li><strong>More compensation rewards, less penalty mechanisms:</strong> Even if the player is not online, they can still get growth in the game, such as offline rewards, experience compensation, etc.; and even if the player quits halfway, there will be no direct punishment, and there is no psychological burden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Lowering the quality because it is positioned as a secondary game? This is not acceptable to players and the market, and becoming a “secondary game” is not an excuse for game manufacturers to slack off. Letting players “meet major needs with low investment” is the standard of a successful secondary game, even if the player only stays in this game for a few hours, has watched the plot once and cleared the level, or has experienced the first 30 levels. I hope that when players look back and think of this game, they will praise it: “At that time, it was very interesting”.</p>
