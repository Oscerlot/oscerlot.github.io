<h2 id="1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models"><a href="#1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models" class="headerlink" title="1. Mainstream Game Payment Models"></a>1. Mainstream Game Payment Models</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “Buy early, enjoy early; buy late, enjoy discounts; don’t buy, get it for free.” After a game’s initial priced release, there’s usually a relatively long period of price stability, which is the main source of revenue for new games in their early stages. After a period of stable operation, there might be limited-time discounts at certain points, such as during Steam sales, to attract hesitant players.</p>
<p>And for some games, the final stage is to completely remove the payment barrier after a long period of operation and switch to free-to-play. <em>PUBG</em>, released in 2017 with an initial price of $29.99 (98 yuan in China), became a free-to-play game in January 2022. <em>Fall Guys</em>, released in August 2020 with an initial price of $19.99 (58 yuan in China), became free-to-play in June 2022. <em>Overwatch</em> went free-to-play when its sequel, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, was released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F74c69f71-14dc-4e51-a38e-dfdd95bb18b3.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>In summary, whether in China or abroad, there are mainly three payment models for online games: The first is buy-to-play, where you pay to purchase the experience qualification and obtain permanent access to the game after payment; examples include <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>New World</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p>
<p>The second is free-to-play, where there is no barrier to entry, replaced mainly by in-game store purchases. Examples include <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<p>The third is a time-based subscription model, where players purchase points to exchange for game time, paying for how much they play. Examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>. This payment model will not be discussed in this article.</p>
<p>So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these different payment models? Why do some developers choose to switch from paid to free, and what issues do game companies need to face when making this decision?</p>
<h3 id="Buy-to-Play-Games"><a href="#Buy-to-Play-Games" class="headerlink" title="Buy-to-Play Games"></a>Buy-to-Play Games</h3><p>For buy-to-play games, the main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game quality is usually relatively higher:</strong> Generally speaking, with similar investment budgets, the quality of buy-to-play games is relatively higher than that of free games. They need to attract players to overcome the payment barrier and try the game with quality. If the manufacturer does not have excellent graphics and core gameplay, it will be difficult to obtain sufficient revenue and reputation from selling the game. Compared with free games that profit from in-game stores, buy-to-play games save a lot of development and design resources on payment and long-term content. Therefore, they have enough manpower and resources to invest in game quality, concentrate on targeted design, and provide players with a better gaming experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Has a certain threshold, fewer cheaters:</strong> For players who use illegal software, they need to pay for the game again for each account they change. Increasing the cost of cheating for players by buying out also has a certain inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cheating to a certain extent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, sometimes the threshold limit is also one of its shortcomings. The mode of paying to purchase an admission ticket will also prevent some players from entering the game, especially since most AAA games are not cheap at the time of their initial release, which will become a factor hindering players from purchasing the game for players with different consumption levels.</p>
<h3 id="Free-Games"><a href="#Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="Free Games"></a>Free Games</h3><p>For free games, the biggest advantage is that there is no threshold. As long as the device can handle it, anyone can enter the game and experience it. Although everyone has different game preferences, and many players will find that they are not the target audience and lose interest in the game after trying it out, due to the large base of new players, the number of players who finally stay in the game may be more than that of some buy-to-play games.</p>
<p>Why do companies like Bluehole, Valve, and Activision Blizzard choose to make originally paid games free? From the data point of view, when making such a decision, the game is likely to have gone downhill for a while, and the number of retained players continues to decrease. Switching to free-to-play is also largely to attract more players who are kept out by the payment barrier. <em>PUBG</em>, a once-phenomenal game, has seen its DAU continue to decline since it reached its online peak in 2018 due to various reasons. By the end of 2021, the average number of online players in the game had fallen below 150,000, and the peak online was only about one-tenth of the peak. After announcing the switch to free-to-play, many free players poured in, the peak number of online players in the game almost doubled, and the average number of online players also increased significantly. <em>Fall Guys</em>, also a game that requires a high number of concurrent players, had very strong data in the early days of its launch, but as its popularity gradually declined, its developers were also considering how to extend the life of the game. After its decision to switch to free-to-play, the total number of players worldwide quickly exceeded 20 million, and exceeded 50 million within 2 weeks, further achieving a large-scale breakthrough in the user base. </p>

What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?"></a>2. What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?</h2><p>Although the effect is good, going free-to-play is not a tool that a game can casually use to attract players. If the following problems are not properly handled, it may have the opposite effect.</p>
<h3 id="Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place"><a href="#Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place" class="headerlink" title="Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place"></a>Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place</h3><p>Players who purchased the game before it went free-to-play are people who spent real money to buy the game and experience it. For developers, this part of the players needs more attention and maintenance. Game manufacturers cannot only focus on attracting new players and not do their best to retain existing veteran players. If the compensation given by the manufacturer to veteran players is sincere and attractive enough, it will also attract a large number of veteran players to return; if the compensation is stingy, veteran players will not only not buy it, but may also give the game a bad review because they feel betrayed, ruining the reputation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F412e1adb-2fb1-49b1-ba99-a54384d27d89.png/size/"></p>
<p>In this regard, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> directly returned the money spent by veteran players to purchase the game in equal proportion as in-game currency when it went free-to-play, so that everyone said “misunderstanding resolved” after learning about the compensation benefits, and called it a great deal; there were even many new players who directly purchased the game at the original price after seeing the news, and then waited for the refund of gold ingots. On the day of the free-to-play launch, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> sold another 1 million copies, once again climbing to the second place on the Steam sales list, and even the official website was overloaded by enthusiastic players. </p>

<h3 id="Anti-Cheat-Work"><a href="#Anti-Cheat-Work" class="headerlink" title="Anti-Cheat Work"></a>Anti-Cheat Work</h3><p>When a game becomes free, it means that there is no payment barrier for anyone to enter the game, and the soil of low account cost is particularly prone to breeding cheating and forming a proliferation. In a fair competitive environment, it is devastating to the game experience of normal players. When criminals can cheat at almost no cost, the gaming experience of normal players will be greatly affected. Especially for tactical competitive games, one cheating player will affect nearly 60 or even 100 normal players in the same game. One-shot headshots and ignoring control make the game experience very bad.</p>
<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>PUBG</em> has been criticized by players for cheating. After going free-to-play, it did not make effective restrictions on cheating. It only launched casual mode and competitive mode to separate paid players and free players when it switched to free. However, not all players are keen on competitive mode. In a mode where cheating is rampant and cannot be banned for a long time, any type of player will have a hard time having a good gaming experience.</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>, which also became a free-to-play game in 2022, has also been plagued by cheating, and is jokingly called “Fairy Bean Man” by players. The gameplay of <em>Fall Guys</em> is a casual level-breaking type, and the number of players in a single game is also large. One person cheating can make all players in this game restart directly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F245c9958-0b14-4b84-b33d-679fda77fe62.png/size/"></p>
<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also realized that once the game is open for free play, a large number of players will flood in, including criminals who intend to cheat. To this end, the development team made preparations in advance and banned 2,754 players who used cheats on the day of the free-to-play launch; at the same time, they also deducted the rank points of 163 players who “rode the cheat car” to warn all new and old players not to try to benefit from cheating, and to maintain a fair game environment in a timely manner.</p>
<h3 id="New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues"><a href="#New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues" class="headerlink" title="New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues"></a>New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues</h3><p>For new players, getting started with an old game that has been in operation for a period of time has a high cost. Veteran players have gone through a lot of training and have mastered many game skills, but new players don’t know anything when they enter the game, which can easily bring them some uncontrollable frustration. After the game goes free-to-play, on the one hand, the game needs to optimize the novice guide, teaching and other onboarding issues to lead new players to quickly master the game. Especially for some new players who have not necessarily been familiar with action games before, this group of non-core players and general players especially need strong novice guidance to teach and retain them. On the other hand, the game also needs to make more optimizations in the matching mechanism, reasonably allocate the rank difference of players in the game, and prevent the “smurfing” behavior of veteran players from leading to the direct churn of new players.</p>
<p>Novice guidance has always been a very important module of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. When it went free-to-play, the game deliberately added a lot of special training in the practice mode, including basic parry practice, charged attack followed by parry practice, jump parry practice, and higher-level operations such as dodge parry and grapple parry. Many of these operations require players to accumulate a certain amount of game time and number of games, and they can only be mastered skillfully after learning in actual combat. Putting them in the practice mode can facilitate players who are not familiar with action operations to carry out more practical exercises, accelerate the learning efficiency, and experience the joy of parrying faster. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2Fc735b95f-c1a2-4995-8f8a-bdb49ae7b4ab.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint’s new novice special training module</em></p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Going free-to-play is not a panacea for a game to revive when its popularity declines. If the decision to go free-to-play and the compensation plan are not fully considered, it may backfire and accelerate the decline of the game. Going free-to-play needs to carefully consider the different needs of new and old players, and ensure the game experience of all types of players, so that the game can have more players to play when it goes free-to-play, and the environment in the game can develop in a more balanced and healthy direction.</p>
