<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone suffers, and no one readily accepts tragedy. In today’s era, people are tired of and even disgusted by consistently happy endings in stories, while also complaining about “knife-inflicting” (creating sad, regretful scenes) plots in entertainment content.  Especially in games, which are meant for entertainment, the inclusion of one heartbreaking scene after another often sparks heated discussions among players.</p>
<p>When players immerse themselves in the game world, savoring the scenes created and the stories written by the developers, they generally ask: Do developers have to “stab” players a few times in the process to get their kicks?  When “stabbed” (seeing heartbreaking scenes), it often triggers strong emotional reactions in players. Why do developers choose to deliver endless “knives” despite the potential backlash?</p>
<h2 id="I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game"><a href="#I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game"></a>I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game</h2><p>The plot in a game has always been responsible for creating a sense of immersion for the player.</p>
<p>Game characters are, after all, virtual. So how do you make players emotionally resonate with them and fully remember them? The emotional ups and downs and character settings brought about by the plot are particularly critical. The establishment of player emotions requires a fluctuating process. They may forget the lines a character once said, but they will definitely find it difficult to forget the scenes that can bring them intense emotional fluctuations. Therefore, developers sometimes choose to create many sad scenes in the plot to promote the development of the plot, arouse changes in player emotions, and further portray the characters.</p>
<p>Like Haurchefant in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, from an insignificant stranger at the beginning, to gradually forming a connection, and finally being killed by a sneak attack. Thinking of the shelter he once provided, the two cups of hot drinks he held, covering the player’s retreat at the Skyfire Locks, standing up for the player in the trial duel, and even personally training a Chocobo for the player, any user would find it difficult to forget this guy who always calls you “my friend.”</p>
<p>There is a Zeigarnik effect in psychology, which refers to the fact that people tend to remember unfinished things or interrupted work, and there is an inherent concept of having a beginning and an end in human nature, so they will be obsessed with things that have no results. When players do not see the content they expect, they will also remember it deeply. When the visual presentation and gameplay do not have much room to stimulate, players will be distressed by the tragic fate of the characters in the plot, thereby mobilizing emotions, and naturally they can remember this feeling, and thus remember this character and this plot, and even like these characters. Perhaps only a deep “feeling of being stabbed” can indicate that the plot has truly touched the player’s heart.</p>
<h2 id="II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”"><a href="#II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”" class="headerlink" title="II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?"></a>II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?</h2><p>So why must it be sadness and regret? Can’t “sweetness” (designing many beautiful scenes and bridges) trigger emotional fluctuations in players?</p>
<p>Perceived control in psychology believes that people believe that they can control themselves and the places, people, objects, emotions, and activities around them. When facing a stranger, if he is doing well, the emotion we first produce is to compare. When you feel that you can’t be as good as the other person, you will have a lower sense of control, and it is easier to develop an inferiority complex, which in turn leads to jealousy or other bad emotions. On the contrary, if this person has gone through hardships and has a bumpy fate, what is more generated is sympathy, and further, a feeling of compassion.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the game plot alone, if a plot “has no knives”, the character has no changes, and everything is very good and smooth, the player may instead feel disgusted, unreal, and even more serious boredom. In games, NPCs and characters who are plain or live a happy life are often not remembered by us, and are more like passers-by.</p>
<p>Tragedy is always easier to touch people’s hearts and resonate with than comedy; that’s why it’s always said that the core of comedy is tragedy, otherwise how can a simple comedy move the audience, let alone make people talk about it with relish afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors"><a href="#III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors" class="headerlink" title="III. Immersion and Mental Anchors"></a>III. Immersion and Mental Anchors</h2><h3 id="Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions"><a href="#Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions"></a>Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions</h3><p>Developers often say that they want to give players a sense of immersion, using visuals and plots to instill emotions into the player’s mind. Immersion is a very mysterious concept. During the game experience, players have positive and negative emotional fluctuations. When positive emotions are dominant, they will experience a focused pleasure and have the motivation to invest in it, entering a state of enjoyment. For example, when a player finishes a plot in the game or passes a relatively difficult level, they burst out with a positive emotional catharsis, and thus experience a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>However, games are often not all about positive emotions. It is necessary to allow players to have a certain degree of negative emotional fluctuations to avoid fatigue and boredom caused by long-term positive feelings. If negative emotions are created through game mechanics and difficulty, it is easy to cause imbalance, leading to direct churn and discouragement. Developers usually adopt more gentle, more widely accepted tragic plots to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch"><a href="#Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch"></a>Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch</h3><p>Mental anchor is a form of conditioned reflex, which refers to “the connection between a certain mood in a person’s heart and a certain action or expression, resulting in a conditioned reflex”. In short, it’s like a switch. When we see this thing, we will have different moods associated with it. We can call such things that can stimulate special feelings, whether good or bad, mental anchors. It’s like a bookmark placed in the heart, which can be used when needed, and the psychological state at the time of setting the mental anchor can be retrieved. Therefore, a mental anchor is more like a “re-experiencing”.</p>
<p>And in games, similar to gameplay types, when we mention a type, we will think of its representative work; in the plot, when we see a flag, we will think of a tragic ending. Just as assassination and parkour gameplay will remind us of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, Cthulhu investigators will easily remind us of <em>Bloodborne</em>, and when we see several corpses and last words in a shelter in <em>The Last of Us</em>, we will naturally depict in our minds a story of a poor person who had to kill a child to prevent the child from becoming a zombie. The game provides classic elements, combines them with various elements in the scene and level, and activates the mental anchors in the player’s mind through scene scheduling, creating an illusion of the plot in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor"><a href="#How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor" class="headerlink" title="How to Build a Mental Anchor"></a>How to Build a Mental Anchor</h3><p>When enough immersion and positive emotions are created in the early stage, and the emotional fluctuations are large enough, a positive mental anchor is buried. The player has positive expectations for the plot and creates their own fantasy of the plot. Or it may further arouse the player’s curiosity, resulting in the idea of “there must be a pit buried here, I must play it to find out, to see if it is the same as I thought”. In the later stage, when “handing out knives” to design heartbreaking scenes, players will also perceive something wrong because of other memories before, activating the mental anchor, and “Run, there are knives here” is the most intuitive feeling.</p>
<p>The strong contrast and the conflict between mental anchors cause strong emotional fluctuations in players. Grasping this emotional change of the player, it makes the player have a deep memory point for this plot and this character. This buries the next mental anchor, so that the next time the player encounters an emotional switch, they will have a sense of déjà vu: “Hey, have I experienced this before?”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the interesting plot is never in the game, but in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In the final analysis, designing “knives” such as tragic plots is just a tool. With a good knife, the characters will be vividly portrayed, the plot conflicts will also be vividly depicted, and the player’s heart will also be “stabbed” severely. After all, although heartbreaking scenes are bitter, they are indispensable. If the “knife” is not given properly, it is just to stimulate the player’s emotions by “tearing up the canvas”, which is more like simply spreading unreasonable negative emotions, with a mentality of “Didn’t expect it, look how bitter it is”, and most players may not buy it. A person who can’t draw a circle with a pen and casually draws an abstract painting will not become a master of art.</p>
<p>The essence of the game is still to be happy, right?</p>
