<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When players experience a new game or new gameplay, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play. On the other hand, game designers feel very confused. The game clearly has a large section of gameplay introduction, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Why do players always “turn a blind eye” to the carefully prepared novice guides by developers? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it? In a previous article, we mainly analyzed what kind of information is easier to be seen from the perspective of involuntary attention.</p>
<p>First, let’s do a brief review.</p>
<p>What is attention? -&gt; If the human brain is a TV, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. What is involuntary attention? -&gt; Those that do not require willful effort and can be naturally noticed by people. For example, a ringing mobile phone in a quiet conference room is hard not to be heard.</p>
<p>What information is easier to attract involuntary attention, that is, easier for players to see (pay attention to)?</p>
<ul>
<li>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated. Such as novel stimuli (more pictures than words, more words than pictures), stimuli with higher relative intensity (such as darkening for emphasis), and motion changes (such as dynamic effects).</li>
<li>The information fits the person’s own state, interests, and needs. For example, when a new player encounters a brand-new function that needs to be used immediately, he will have a clear need for the novice tutorial. At this time, the pop-up guide will be more easily noticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the characteristics of attention, the inspiration for novice guide design is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast effect 1: More pictures, look at words; more words, look at pictures; highlight the differences.</li>
<li>Contrast effect 2: Less is more; the more blank space, the easier it is to be seen.</li>
<li>Multi-channel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation.</li>
<li>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text are, the better the learning (any form of prompt clues can guide players to pay attention to the key points faster).</li>
<li>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in the actual novice guide design, if the planner makes it according to the above standards, can it be ensured that the player can see it? Not necessarily. Specific problems still need specific analysis. In this article, we will present several conclusions that are different from the previous sharing, and will still explain why this happens from the perspective of attention.</p>
<h2 id="I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”"><a href="#I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”" class="headerlink" title="I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?"></a>I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?</h2><p>Let’s start with a non-prize quiz. In the following guidance screen about Parry in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, where do you think the player’s visual focus will be. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fed990d34-bf9b-4198-b60e-341aea98b4bd.webp/size/" alt="Image of Naraka: Bladepoint Parry tutorial"></p>
<p>There will mainly be 3 answers to this experiment. One answer is on the character, one answer is on the restraint relationship diagram in the upper left corner, and a few answers are on the controller diagram in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, none of the above answers are correct. The eye-tracking test results show an answer that surprises everyone. Players only saw the animation at the beginning, and then focused on the text below, and did not watch the animation demonstration again. And this is not just an individual case of one player. In the test of 10 players, 7-8 similar guide video contents in the game guide, the player’s focus is not on the video, but on the text.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Generally, we will think that vivid and visual pictures and personally demonstrated videos will be more focused on by players, and they will have more patience to watch them than boring text introductions, helping players learn some complex operations.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another type of attention - “voluntary attention”. In contrast to “involuntary attention”, “voluntary attention” is a conscious act of paying attention that requires willful effort. When we need to learn complex knowledge, we need the real “top student” type of “voluntary attention” to play.</p>
<p>As the eye-tracking data shows, at the beginning of the video, the player’s attention is attracted by the animation. At this time, “involuntary attention” is playing a role, which is in line with the principle that the higher the stimulus intensity, the more attention it attracts. But soon, the player finds that he can’t understand this animation. At this time, voluntary attention comes into play. For voluntary attention, familiarity is an important influencing factor. The more familiar things are, the faster the processing starts, and the easier it is to attract people’s attention at this time. Compared with the animation that cannot be understood, Chinese characters are still more familiar, so the brain is more inclined to process the text below, which is more helpful for understanding this guide. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2d43d828-ea76-44ba-b3f2-df5c60af63aa.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking data"></p>
<p>For the same guide, if it is shown to players who are already familiar with <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, their focus will be more on the video, because they are familiar with the various elements in the video and can quickly understand the information conveyed by the video interpretation. But for new players, the attack moves, blue light, and white light elements in the video are all unfamiliar, let alone understanding the relationship between them through interpretation.</p>
<p>Under the same conditions, the information transmission effect of video is better than that of text, and it is more able to capture attention. This is beyond doubt. This is also a place where it is easier to fall into the trap. Believing in the video theory transmission effect of video pictures, but ignoring the understandability of video pictures, will make players turn to complex text guidance with a low ceiling but a lower threshold.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for designers to find that players have this unexpected behavior through their own tests, because the familiarity of planners and players with this video is completely different. Combining the characteristics of voluntary attention, in this guide video, if the presentation of key elements or relationships can be matched with brief text descriptions that players are more “familiar” with, it can better capture the player’s attention and also help understanding.</p>
<h2 id="II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It"><a href="#II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It" class="headerlink" title="II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?"></a>II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?</h2><p>Does this desperate situation really exist? Yes, it does. Are players really so reluctant to read guides? No, sometimes they really don’t see them.</p>
<p>In the attention processing mechanism, we have a theory called the cognitive resource theory. This theory regards “attention” as a set of cognitive resources or cognitive abilities to classify and identify stimuli. These cognitive resources are limited. When the stimulus is more complex or the processing task is more complex, the more cognitive resources are occupied. When cognitive resources are fully occupied, new stimuli will not be processed. This is what we call the state of “turning a deaf ear to the outside world and concentrating on reading only the books of sages”.</p>
<p>At this time, it is easier for us to understand why the eye-tracking trajectory diagram of the following novice guide appears like this. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7de25631-f8af-4107-8428-a29489b15c60.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking on a tutorial screen"></p>
<p>From this picture, we can also find that the player’s focus is completely concentrated on the surrounding scene, that is, the things that are highly related to the current task. They are focusing on performing the task at hand, so they turn a deaf ear to such obvious guidance prompts above. In the actual test, most of the players also stated that they did not see the prompt text above.</p>
<p>But for us who are looking at such pictures, because we don’t need to consider the tasks that the player is currently performing, the attention processing resources are not occupied. The guide text above, “Double-click the A+D keys to roll in the specified direction and avoid the slash”, is very easy to attract our attention, and almost no one will not see it.</p>
<p>The more cognitive resources are occupied, the more concentrated the attention, and the smaller the scope of attention. In tasks that require identifying the details of things, the human field of vision is only about 1-2 degrees. This size is about the size of your thumbnail when you hold your arm parallel. When we get information, we don’t look at ten lines at a glance, but our eyeballs are constantly turning and shifting the point of gaze.</p>
<p>When the eyeball is stationary, the human visual coverage is about 220 degrees. But when you need to identify the details of things, such as reading text or recognizing a logo, you need to continuously rotate your eyeballs to project the position you want to know to the fovea of the retina (Fovea - a small depression in the center of the retina cone cells, that is, the macula, which can perceive the richest image details). This is also the principle of the eye tracker. The eye tracking system is mainly capturing the gaze points and the transfer behavior between gaze points. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F97bdeb4b-0109-4a9a-a3bb-fa446080f050.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of human eye and visual field"></p>
<p>In response to this situation, a common practice is to place auxiliary information as much as possible within the range of concentrated attention. For example, the head-up display of a car. When driving, the attention is mainly focused on observing the road conditions, and the gaze range is mainly concentrated in the windshield range. The information on the traditional car dashboard is relatively difficult to be noticed during driving. Therefore, some new cars try to display driving assistance information on the windshield. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0cf66d46-3c68-4a97-89e0-294700a8a8fc.webp/size/" alt="Example of a car&#39;s head-up display"></p>
<p>In games, some better practices are to put the guide on the task-related gaze path, or next to the character or weapon that the player gazes at more, which can ensure that the prompt information can be noticed more effectively. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> places button prompts on the target scene; <em>God of War</em> displays some operation guides next to the axe. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F4dc46fcc-ef41-497e-8f5a-225d4d4086e5.webp/size/" alt="Examples of in-game guides placed near points of interest"></p>
<h2 id="III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?"></a>III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?</h2><p>From the above several cases, we understand that when players concentrate on performing game tasks, the scope of attention is very small. The gaze point is mostly distributed near the task-related path and the character. So do all prompt information need to be stacked near the character? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another attention processing theory, the dual processing theory of attention: human cognitive processing has two types: automatic processing and conscious controlled processing. The former is not limited by cognitive resources, does not require attention, and can be carried out automatically; the latter is limited by cognitive resources, requires attention, and can be continuously adjusted according to changes in the environment. That is, when performing multiple activities at the same time, one or more of them have become automated processes, and individuals no longer need to consume cognitive resources, and they can concentrate their attention on other cognitive processes. Consciously controlled processing may be transformed into automatic processing after a lot of practice. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2b4eaad9-5b58-42a2-9913-1a997cf0d8d2.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of the dual processing theory of attention"></p>
<p>Therefore, although our processing resources are limited, if we can automatically process more information, we can cover more and more comprehensive information. Experience can transform the content of voluntary attention into automatic processing, which does not occupy cognitive resources, so that more information can be processed.</p>
<p>In games, the most obvious manifestation is the difference in the gaze range between veterans and novices. As can be seen from the figure below, the visual range of both new and veteran players is centered on themselves. However, the visual attention range of veteran players is larger, accounting for more than 1&#x2F;3 of the whole; the visual attention range of novice players is smaller, about 1&#x2F;4 of the whole. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7fc21bf4-ec25-43ef-b26f-a2da0a52c62b.webp/size/" alt="Comparison of gaze range between novice and veteran players"></p>
<p>Veterans can achieve a good degree of automatic identification of tasks such as character movement and combat, so they have more attention resources to notice other information prompts that appear on the interface, and can also gaze at a larger range of interface information to complete tasks when needed, such as the skill bar at the bottom.</p>
<p>This attention processing feature has many inspirations for developers. First of all, for the design of novice guidance prompts, the position of guidance prompts does need to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. Secondly, the interface display information is gradually unfolded step by step, so that players can adapt first, become proficient in a basic content, so that they can gradually enter automatic processing, and then enter the next. By gradually transforming the information processing process of some basic tasks into automatic processing, the amount of information that novice players can process at the same time is gradually expanded.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, let’s make a review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text is not necessarily inferior to pictures, because in real information processing tasks, voluntary attention mainly plays a role, and familiarity is an important influencing factor. Users tend to process familiar information sources that are more conducive to information processing. Therefore, if the video format is used for guidance, the understandability of the video content presentation is very important.</li>
<li>When performing real tasks, the gaze range is very limited, and the gaze range is strongly related to task-related elements, such as being more concentrated near the character and task path. Therefore, some important information that needs to be noticed by the player can be displayed in these areas.</li>
<li>The information processing range of novices is very limited. First, the position of guidance prompts needs to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. At the same time, it is necessary to gradually display information, so that players can gradually process automatically and expand the range of information that can be processed at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, in the novice guide design, it is also necessary to consider the player’s own information familiarity and the characteristics of attention in actual task execution. It is not possible to simply rely on common image display rules, and specific analysis should be made for specific situations.</p>
