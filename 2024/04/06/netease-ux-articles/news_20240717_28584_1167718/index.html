<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we collect various items and unlock new information in games, we often use a system that is not so attractive to players, but is very important - the Bestiary system. Setting up a Bestiary system is one of the most direct ways to reflect the worldview of the entire game. It can carry various character settings, achievement information, item map data, and so on in each game.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the design of the Bestiary, introducing different game cases for analysis, aiming to explore some important commonalities and advantages in Bestiary design, in order to provide some ideas and references for Bestiary design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems"><a href="#1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems"></a>1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems</h2><p>The concept of “Bestiary (pictorial book)” originally refers to the creation of a general natural history book by drawing scientific illustrations of things in a certain field and adding corresponding explanatory texts. In many games, there are “bestiaries” with different or similar functionalities. In this case, it can be defined as “a collectible system that can collect, classify, display, and allow players to consult various item information obtained by players in various ways in the game.. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F451e98b5-0892-4f49-8984-3431946ba4e0.webp/size/" alt="《Pokémon Scarlet and Violet》 Pokédex"></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Bestiary system can present several main types according to their respective classification attributes. Here they are divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement Bestiary</strong>, which includes achievements, game endings, and CG collections, tending to collect certain results obtained by players;</li>
<li><strong>Collectible item Bestiary</strong>, such as weapons, costumes, recipes, plants, materials, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Text information Bestiary</strong>, such as some story background information, character information, and dialogue information obtained in puzzle games;</li>
<li><strong>Character Bestiary</strong>, including characters, creature settings, character information, display of unlocked new characters, and may be accompanied by other functions, such as a favorability system (such as in <em>Love and Sword</em> (Chinese Title: 遇见逆水寒), <em>Stardew Valley</em>);</li>
<li><strong>Other systems with Bestiary attributes</strong>, this type may not be a pure Bestiary collection interface, but it can bring players a similar experience, such as clothing and furniture decoration systems, card collection interfaces, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa119104e-9bfe-4016-8718-6b053824e1ca.webp/size/" alt="Stardew Valley Character Gift Guide Bestiary"></p>
<h2 id="2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design"><a href="#2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design"></a>2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design</h2><p>Bestiary design involves one of the main gameplays: collection gameplay, and the Bestiary system is the most intuitive way to display the results of collection gameplay.</p>
<p>Adding collection elements to the game is an important way to enhance the player’s sense of accomplishment and prolong the player’s game retention time. Take open-world games as an example. In open-world games, if there are only main quests and side quests, more costs need to be invested in writing the storyline, which will consume more time and budget. Therefore, placing some collection elements as “seasoning” and “content filler” is a time-saving and labor-saving solution. It can directly increase the content of the game, guide players to explore the map, and add fun to the open-world experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F28aa85c7-1da0-4abe-8646-1dd7ef815488.webp/size/" alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey Map Collectible Markers"></p>
<p>In the book “The Overspent American”, Harvard University economist Juliet Schor proposed a new concept - the “Diderot Effect” or “matching effect”, which specifically refers to the phenomenon that people continue to configure items that match them after owning a new item to achieve psychological balance.</p>
<p>Therefore, many games use people’s “matching psychology” to stimulate players’ desire to collect, add matching designs, sets, and other concepts, and consider how to design the Bestiary system from the perspectives of player psychology and interactive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles"><a href="#Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles"></a>Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles</h3><p>When designing, collectibles can be classified and arranged according to different types of labels. Collected collectibles are displayed in order, and uncollected collectibles appear in a semi-transparent, gray silhouette, or other unlocked way. In addition to making the items more intuitive and orderly, this can also make it easier for players to see how many things they may be missing in the same type of Bestiary, arousing players’ desire to collect. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F33fefec6-4748-407a-98ea-153916164810.webp/size/" alt="Famine creates a character dressing interface"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”"><a href="#Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”" class="headerlink" title="Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”"></a>Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”</h3><p>In games, how to greatly increase the frequency of use of the Bestiary and make various interaction processes more convenient and concentrated? The answer is to use a functionally integrated approach. In addition to the most critical Bestiary function, let some Bestiaries carry other functions, such as placing level, combat skill display, and promotion UI; placing character skin and clothing collections, store, and other page jump UIs.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the hero display page clearly serves as a character Bestiary. In the interface, it can be seen that whether it is character information, combat strength attributes, and character skills, or related appearance changes and other functions, they are clearly and directly presented on the same interface. When players enter the character Bestiary, they mostly want to check other information related to the character. This is also a design method that conforms to the player’s interactive thinking. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F46d89aa8-d090-4205-8a91-7d0a92cc8f09.webp/size/" alt="Naraka: Bladepoint Hero Display Page"></p>
<p>At this time, the Bestiary system becomes an important part of the fully integrated game experience, rather than a dispensable independent interface. This Bestiary attribute system with comprehensive functions will become one of the key interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles"><a href="#Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles" class="headerlink" title="Add Path Guidance to Collectibles"></a>Add Path Guidance to Collectibles</h3><p>There are two schemes for the path guidance of collectibles: one is to prompt or tell the player where to obtain the collectible, including map information or limited-time event information; the other is that after the player collects the item, the information related to the collectible will also be unlocked. After that, when the player wants to collect this item again, they can directly check the location information in the Bestiary. In survival adventure games, farming management games, and card games, adding path guidance to the Bestiary is a very common and important design method. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa00bab7a-1275-44a9-8be5-a3853d92142c.webp/size/" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Bestiary Screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary"><a href="#3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary" class="headerlink" title="3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary"></a>3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary</h2><h3 id="Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces"><a href="#Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces"></a>Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces</h3><p>Many common Bestiaries are made by planar interface design methods. They can incorporate artistic and emotional understanding of the game background on the basis of concise and clear design. This design can make the Bestiary system not grab the attention of other interfaces. In other words, developers do not need this interface to be so attractive, but it must be harmoniously integrated into the game environment and maintain overall consistency with other interfaces of the same level.</p>
<p>For example, the construction and collection interfaces of <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> inherit the style of the game itself, using dark tones to set off the atmosphere, which is in line with the story background setting of the game; the UI size is prominent, and the distribution is simple and clear, and players can quickly find the items they want to click. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F3540e505-8c9f-41a7-8f5d-ace03a286dae.webp/size/" alt="*Cult of the Lamb*"></p>
<h3 id="Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion"><a href="#Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion"></a>Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion</h3><p>Most of the impressive Bestiary designs on the market, or the Bestiary systems in high-quality games in the hearts of players, have one thing in common, that is, they use the situational design of the game. The situational design of the Bestiary can be said to be centered on and aimed at highlighting and expressing the worldview, and is closely linked to the performance of the GUI. By packaging the interface in a way that conforms to and is embedded in the game background, players can have emotional resonance and recognition.</p>
<p>This kind of situational design can also be called scene-based design to some extent, because producers often use perspective scenes for specific performance. Generally speaking, its production process can be three-dimensional or two-dimensional, but from the perspective of the presentation results, their common feature is that the function of the Bestiary is placed in a three-dimensional scene. Among them, not only around the scene, but more emphasis on the sense of substitution, immersion, and atmosphere in the background of this worldview.</p>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a classic case of immersive situational Bestiary design. Its special feature is the use of a walk-in scene. A walk-in scene is a special category of scene-based Bestiaries. Players can operate characters to move and interact in the packaged Bestiary system, which generally appears in three-dimensional games. <em>Animal Crossing</em> cleverly packages the Bestiary into a museum that can be walked in. Players can display the collected items in the form of display and display. When players see that the fossil fragments collected on weekdays are spliced into complete fossils, and the aquarium and insect hall become colorful and vivid, they will feel that the time and energy they put into collection are very worthwhile. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F632955fc-a6db-47be-b0fa-2caea4fc6d9a.gif/size/" alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Museum Area"></p>
<p>Situational design can also be exemplified by Nintendo’s <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. In this game, players can use a vacuum cleaner to capture ghosts, and check the names and types of ghosts we captured in the doctor’s display room, and also see the different Bosses collected in the plot. In the interface, players can switch multiple glass sealed vessels left and right, which contain different collected ghosts.</p>
<p>Although the scene perspective is fixed and players cannot move, being able to manipulate the glowing glass jars that look like scientific laboratory glass jars still gives players a strong sense of atmosphere. The background setting and emotional response are well conveyed to the players through the scene. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0c31837c-540f-4de7-87df-318d4fdc94b3.gif/size/" alt="Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3 Ghost Bestiary"></p>
<h3 id="Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers"><a href="#Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers" class="headerlink" title="Reasonably Choose Special Carriers"></a>Reasonably Choose Special Carriers</h3><p>Special Bestiary carriers actually exist in both planar types and situational types. The reason why they are analyzed separately is that this is a way to make full use of the Bestiary to increase the game effect.</p>
<p><em>The Forest</em> is a first-person open-world survival game. The protagonist survives in the primitive jungle in a plane crash accident, and the Bestiary design inside is also very worthy of reference. The designer combines all the important information that players must consult, such as weapon and material production methods, and jungle creature records, into a “survival guide”. Through the form of this special carrier, supplemented by the immersive first-person browsing dynamics, it can give a good sense of substitution, which is very in line with the game setting and the interaction is very convenient. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F60266013-c838-474f-9878-e8ab9460de7b.gif/size/" alt="The Forest Production Bestiary &quot;Survival Guide&quot;"></p>
<h3 id="Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs"><a href="#Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs" class="headerlink" title="Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs"></a>Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs</h3><p>In addition, the interaction level and different positions of the Bestiary in the game also have different effects.</p>
<p>Some games will directly place part of the Bestiary system on the main interface of the initial entry into the game, at the same level as the “save and load”, “start game” and other UIs. This is so that players can quickly check their gains when starting and ending the game. It also shows that this type of Bestiary system can generally be slightly separated from the main content of the game, and players can consult the Bestiary after playing.</p>
<p>Many Bestiary systems, especially the functionally integrated Bestiary systems mentioned above, will mostly be set at the same level as “vbackpack”, “character status” and other functions, in a conspicuous place on the game interface or set as a pop-up interface for commonly used keys. At this time, the primary purpose is for players to be able to find and use them in a timely manner. </p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>A good Bestiary system design can be guided by the game’s worldview, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game world and enhance the game experience. As one of the important systems in the game, the Bestiary system can not only provide strategic guidance and collection value, but also enrich the content of the game and increase playability through different types of Bestiary presentations.</p>
<p>All in all, in the process of game production, Bestiary system design is essential to create an attractive game world.</p>
