<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167423.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> previously released Mirror Pavilion dungeon, the music for one of the outer pavilion bosses, Nan Wenxue, left a particularly deep impression on players. It was able to effectively mobilize players’ emotions, making them feel the poignancy and murderous intent from Nan Wenxue, creating a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>This sparked thought: why do we have such a strong memory of some music? And how can this phenomenon be explained from a psychological perspective?</p>
<p>Comments on the NetEase Cloud Music page for “You Mei Xiao Gu” (Withered Plum Bone), the boss music for Mirror Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue are positive, and refer to it’s quality.</p>
<h2 id="I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work"><a href="#I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work" class="headerlink" title="I. How Attention and Memory Work"></a>I. How Attention and Memory Work</h2><p>Before further explaining this phenomenon through examples, we need to first understand how the human brain’s attention and memory work.</p>
<h3 id="Memory"><a href="#Memory" class="headerlink" title="Memory"></a>Memory</h3><p>When receiving external information, this information first enters sensory memory, then enters short-term memory, and then enters long-term memory after a series of encodings.</p>
<p>Sensory memory usually refers to memory of about 1 second. Here, the brain will quickly perceive a large amount of information from the outside world, but at the same time, most of the information will also disappear quickly. Only the information that is noticed will enter short-term memory.</p>
<p>If we were to use a computer’s working mode as an analogy, short-term memory can be compared to cache. It passively stores the audio-visual information we hear and see, although it allows us to quickly retrieve memories. It cannot store a large amount of content at one time, and its capacity is relatively small.</p>
<p>Long-term memory is RAM. Comparatively, it can store more content and has a larger capacity, but it requires us to deliberately and actively save information, and the process of saving information is relatively time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="Attention"><a href="#Attention" class="headerlink" title="Attention"></a>Attention</h3><p>Everyone’s brain has a certain amount of “cognitive resources”, and exceeding the limit will cause “cognitive load.” In the case of a large amount of information constantly stimulating the brain every minute and every second, how does the brain process this information to avoid cognitive load?</p>
<p>The answer is through “attention.” Attention has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> The brain will selectively attend to some information while ignoring other information.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The brain will eliminate irrelevant stimuli to ensure that information is concentrated.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> The brain’s operation is linear, so “attention”, which is very important in the process of filtering information, also needs to remain stable for a certain period.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Often, we are not fully invested in a single event. When doing two or more things at the same time, it will involve the allocation of attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was mentioned above that the brain will eliminate irrelevant information stimuli, so how does the brain reduce interference?</p>
<p>The human brain has an area specifically responsible for suppressing irrelevant interference input. When the auditory area and the visual area are triggered at the same time, the prefrontal cortex will selectively inhibit the relatively less important area according to the importance of the information. By suppressing the information flow of the unimportant area, the information flow of another area will become relatively more prominent.</p>
<h2 id="II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories"><a href="#II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories" class="headerlink" title="II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?"></a>II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?</h2><p>After understanding how the brain works in attention and memory, let’s look at how the brain remembers music.</p>
<p>When playing games and listening to some game music with specific tonality, we use short-term memory more, in which “short-term musical memory” plays a key role.</p>
<p>What the brain remembers is not a complete melody, but the harmonic structure carried by the melody. In the previous article, “<em>How Games Control Your Emotions Through Music</em>,” it was mentioned that harmony will determine the emotional color of the melody to a certain extent. Whether it is happy or sad, excited or relaxed, and harmonic progression will constitute the development direction of the music, whether it is moving towards the climax or coming to the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, our brain will remember this harmonic context, and will further understand the melody heard based on this harmonic context.</p>
<p>In the process of remembering music with only one tonality, it is normal to have a few unclear memories. Switching to the scene of recalling and retrieving musical memories, the brain will try to fill in this note in the process of outlining the melody. The logic of filling in is based on the melody contour, and a relatively close alternative note is located from the tonality constituted by the harmonic context to fill in this vacancy.</p>
<h2 id="III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering"><a href="#III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering" class="headerlink" title="III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?"></a>III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?</h2><p>In our previous research, we found that in most cases, players tend to not care about the specific details of the battle music, but just “listen to a sound”, or more accurately, listen to the “emotional atmosphere.”</p>
<p>So, why is there this phenomenon?</p>
<p>During battle, there will be many changes in vision, such as the attack direction of the big boss and the operations of teammates. At the same time, hearing will also continue to transmit various battle information, scene information, and so on. Under the bombardment of a large amount of information, in order to avoid cognitive load, the brain will allocate cognitive resources from top to bottom, choosing to focus attention on the more important battle and ignoring other information, so as to better adjust battle strategies based on information changes.</p>
<p>Zooming in on the brain’s operation, at this time, the prefrontal cortex will inhibit part of the auditory information flow, so that the visual information flow is more obvious and easier to remember.</p>
<p>At the level of conscious awareness, auditory attention is more biased towards listening to the content of teammates opening the microphone, and at the same time, background music will be ignored, because it is necessary to cooperate with teammates. But this does not mean that the background music is useless. At this time, the role of the background music is more biased towards the subconscious level, mainly acting on the arousal of emotions, making people feel the passionate atmosphere of the battle.</p>
<p>This leads to another question, why do some people feel that playing music while playing games interferes with their strategic thinking, while others feel more passionate and immersive?</p>
<p>In fact, everyone’s cognitive resources are different, some are high and some are low, and there are individual differences. Among them, people with larger cognitive resource capacity can process more information at the same time. At the same time, everyone’s focus on information is also different. People who care about the sense of immersion brought by game music will be more easily immersed in the emotional atmosphere created by the music, while people who don’t care may feel that the music interferes with their thinking.</p>
<p>But no matter which group of people, everyone’s primary memory is the emotional atmosphere brought by the music, not the details of the music. Generally speaking, without prompts, players cannot directly recall what the battle music is like.</p>
<p><em>Justice Online Mobile</em> has corresponding city music for different cities. Some will change with the day and night and the weather, so that you can be immersed in it when exploring or running around.</p>
<p>Unlike battles, when exploring and running around, cognitive resources are no longer highly concentrated on a certain matter, players are more open to information, and their attention will also be more dispersed. At this time, they can pay attention to some small designs, whether it is scene sound effects such as birdsong, water flow, or background music. This is also why players are more likely to recall exploration music with distinct melodic characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered"><a href="#IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered" class="headerlink" title="IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?"></a>IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?</h2><p>Returning to the original question, why can the music of <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> boss Nan Wenxue be remembered?</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody"><a href="#Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody"></a>Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody</h3><p>In this boss music, the production team incorporated vocal design. This means that when players listen to this piece of music, in addition to the music information, there is actually text information, and the brain will also process the lyrics in an additional layer. This makes the human voice stand out among a bunch of instruments. This strong contrast effect will also make it easier for players to notice the human voice, and then notice the music.</p>
<p><em>The south branch is withered, the wind holds the snow and turns, don’t let it fall. The fragrance disappears, the plum blossoms scatter, and the floating life follows the flowing water. - Lyrics of “You Mei Xiao Gu”</em></p>
<h3 id="Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics"><a href="#Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics"></a>Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous article, the effect of music and gameplay is often 1+1&gt;2. On the basis of excellent gameplay mechanism design, Nan Wenxue’s vocal singing coordinates well with the gameplay. It roughly appears shortly before and after the appearance of the Peach Blossom Girl, setting off the atmosphere and making players feel the “killing intent” from the boss.</p>
<p>Why is it effective at this node? This is because here, except for individual players who need to focus on the position of the boss, most of the others are in a state of pure fighting without needing to think too much about battle and positioning strategies. Players’ cognitive resources still have a lot of spare capacity at this node to notice corresponding design details.</p>
<h3 id="Repetitive-Stimulation"><a href="#Repetitive-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Repetitive Stimulation"></a>Repetitive Stimulation</h3><p>The Mirror Pavilion·Outer Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue, the dungeon boss, is both an interesting and challenging dungeon boss in this raid. Because there is a certain degree of difficulty, and the dungeon is an important channel for equipment upgrades, players will continue to participate in this dungeon. The impressive female vocal singing of “You Mei Xiao Gu” is also set in the boss stage that players will experience. This means that players will generally experience this piece of music once every time they participate in this dungeon. Like the learning process, this repeated emphasis and stimulation can deepen the brain’s memory of the music segment, thereby making the music more likely to enter long-term memory, making people have an impression and remember it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, understanding the player’s attention and memory patterns, including the neural operation process of the brain, can assist the development team in designing details in the game that better meet the needs of the experience. In the process of designing music, it is also necessary to linearly and structurally understand the process and rhythm of the entire gameplay. Doing the right design at the right node can achieve better results.</p>
