<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Games, as an important social medium, have one of their most important functions: the ability to quickly mobilize people’s emotions in a short period. In many games, one of the most common elements that mobilize players’ emotions is the game character. Because whether it is deeply exploring the plot or experiencing intense battles, the first thing players come into contact with is the character.</p>
<p>So what kind of game character can best capture the player’s heart in the first place? An important point is to enable players to truly immerse themselves in the role and experience the game immersively during the game, that is, to quickly enter a state of flow. The state that people show when they are focused on something is called flow by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. For example, when an artist is creating, when a player is engrossed in a game, their energy is completely invested in it, and at the same time, they have a strong sense of excitement and fulfillment. This is also why we sometimes play a game so “selflessly” that we ignore the passage of time.</p>
<p>When we talk about game characters, there are many ways to express the dimensions that are often mentioned. This article will focus on the visual image, persona, personality and other aspects of the character to explore what kind of game characters can capture the player’s heart and leave a unique and vivid impression.</p>
<h2 id="I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character"><a href="#I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="I. The External Image of the Character"></a>I. The External Image of the Character</h2><p>External image usually refers to the character’s shape, appearance, physical attributes, etc. When first getting to know a character, the first thing a player sees is their external image, and whether the player likes the character or not is often initially judged at first sight. Only when there is initial goodwill towards the character will there be an interest in further understanding the character.</p>
<p>For example, during the promotional period before the official launch of the character Ji Yingying in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, even in just 20 seconds of the trailer CG, players couldn’t resist her “smile back”, and almost couldn’t forget her face at first sight. An amazing first impression also laid a good foundation for Ji Yingying’s continued high popularity. After her hero’s actual gameplay demonstration was released, the skill effects based on the Wuchang Lock and Nether Fire also brought players a hearty battle experience, enhancing the sense of satisfaction from multiple senses.</p>
<p>Another example is YORHA No. 2 Type B (2B), one of the protagonists of <em>NieR: Automata</em>. She is the most popular character in the game and the most beautiful character in the hearts of players. Short white hair, blue-grey eyes, wearing a black blindfold (standard military goggles), carrying a silver-white samurai sword behind her, coupled with a black Gothic-style dress, the cool image surprised everyone as soon as it appeared. In addition, she always covers her eyes with a black half-face blindfold, revealing only a little bit of her face, which also casts a mysterious veil over this character. The form of wielding a giant weapon in battle, the agility, and the elegant action design, combined with the setting of a mecha-girl, are even more eye-catching.</p>
<h2 id="II-Character-Persona-Tags"><a href="#II-Character-Persona-Tags" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Persona Tags"></a>II. Character Persona Tags</h2><p>Giving characters some specific persona tags can enhance the richness and three-dimensionality of the characters and help establish psychological identification with players. This is the core process of closely connecting the player’s heart with the character, and it is also a crucial part of driving the player’s preferences and decision-making and other psychological mechanisms. When a character has prominent traits, it is easy for players to establish a good impression of them.</p>
<p>For example, previously, on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, the official released a vote, allowing players to choose the best series of games and characters in their minds. Among them, Emet-Selch from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> ranked first in the number of votes. One of the reasons why he is so popular with players is his distinctive and contrasting personality.</p>
<p>First of all, when he first appeared, the initial impression he gave players was a puzzling and very indifferent villain image. But with more in-depth contact and understanding later, his completely opposite gentle and careful side will gradually be revealed. Combined with his personal experience: although he is good at conspiracy and has killed many people, his inner obsession is ultimately just to find his relatives and revive his compatriots. This kind of flesh-and-blood, and very contrasting personality makes players love and hate him, and leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>Taking Ji Yingying as an example, in the story background of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, she is the most outstanding ghost messenger of the Wuchang Division, and she is a daunting existence in Morus Isle. Her hero introduction describes her as, “The infernal fire from the netherworld will burn all those who have betrayed her.” At the same time, her powerful combat ability also aroused the player’s admiration for the strong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, her persona is a “three-no girl”, silent, introverted, and keeping strangers away, which creates a sense of contrast, making players not only imagine that without emotions, it is hard to imagine how strong she would be. Looking at her life background, she was abandoned by her family since she was a child and bears the infernal fire of revenge as Bai Wuchang - players will always remember the character they deeply sympathized with. The persona tags discussed above can effectively evoke and strengthen the player’s emotions.</p>
<p>When a game character goes deep into the player’s mind, the character is established. We found in our research that when players examine their appearance and skins, they will also have a conventional answer based on the character’s image. Players are more concerned about the fit of fashion and characters. Factors such as lines, voice, hero stories, and character relationships that constitute the three-dimensionality of the character’s personality will affect the player’s judgment on whether a piece of fashion is beautiful and coordinated, and whether it has a story, and whether it can stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very risky to easily change the persona or create points that contradict the original persona. For example, the male character Temulch in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> was set from the beginning of the game as the bloodline of the prairie wolf king. “The legends of the ancestors are engraved in the mind, and the great glory is in front of you. The wolf from the prairie will run wildly again.” When he puts on a gorgeous dress, there are many players who stick to the persona, and they will feel very out of place.</p>
<h2 id="III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Inner Character of the Character"></a>III. The Inner Character of the Character</h2><p>Inner personality usually refers to the character’s internal tendencies and psychological characteristics, in terms of thinking and behavior towards people, things, and themselves. Just like the popularity of MBTI tests among friends in recent years, some personality tests are popular because they can give people more recognition and a sense of belonging from a psychological point of view. When everyone has their own “personality label”, they can quickly establish and deepen people’s understanding of each other.</p>
<p>People always yearn to understand their own hearts and are obsessed with finding similar souls that resonate with them. In the game, when a character’s internal personality is rich and three-dimensional enough, it also has the importance of conveying emotions. Players’ preferences for the personality traits of game characters also vary from person to person. These characteristics can be confident, humorous, vulnerable, kind, brave; they can be like Astarion in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, with a complex but unique personality; they can be like Geralt in <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, a mature and professional witcher, providing players with a deep sense of empowerment and helping them deal with powerful enemies; or you can also fall in love with Tali in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, and she doesn’t even have a face.</p>
<p>The above are examples of popular game character images with distinct characteristics that are loved by players all over the world. They are unique in the hearts of players and can also resonate strongly with players. At the same time, there are also many characters that are relatively unattractive. We found in player research that players will give feedback such as “no impression”, “not sure what he (in the story) wants to do, what is his goal”, “seems to see the shadow of several existing characters”, etc. for some characters who have a relatively low sense of existence in some games, that is, the characterization is “stereotyped”.</p>
<p>The stereotyped here does not refer to the visual image of the face. After all, many games now support personalized face customization. Players can customize their faces according to their own preferences, or even photos. The character stereotype discussed in this article focuses more on internal personality traits.</p>
<p>For example, in our research on a certain game, based on the data fed back by players, we compared the similarity of personality traits of two male characters and found that the similarity of the two in various dimensions is extremely high. This is also the reason why players are confused and ask “the two are indistinguishable”. If there is no difference in internal personality, it will be difficult to create a memorable character in the subsequent development of the character line.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In many scenarios where we usually contact users, whether it is about art or gameplay, players always tend to focus on characters. By shaping a memorable character, we can better understand the motivation and emotional connection of players to experience the game, and also better understand how to deepen the attraction and psychological identification of players in the game.</p>
<p>The above is a preliminary exploration of character shaping in game design. In addition, the character’s special skills, dubbing, etc. are also sufficient manifestations to help shape its three-dimensional image and identity. Of course, when talking about a certain character, we are definitely not looking at it from a single dimension. Only by fully considering many factors such as the character’s appearance, background, personality, and setting can we create a distinctive and beloved character.</p>
