<p>Horror works often use jumpscares as one of the basic building blocks of horror. This technique uses sudden scene changes and sound effects to make the player or audience “jump.”</p>
<p>Christopher Robert Cargill, screenwriter for the <em>Sinister</em> film series, explained the principle of jumpscares: “Jumpscares work because there’s misdirection. A successful jumpscare is like a magic trick. I’ll make you look over here, and I’ll do something over there, and then suddenly—bang!—something will scare you.”</p>
<p>As early as the 1976 film <em>Carrie</em>, the jumpscare at the end made the audience shudder: when the audience thought everything was over and saw Sue peacefully visiting Carrie’s grave with flowers, they would be scared by the hand that suddenly came out of the grave. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F32fb979f-fdb6-4fa8-8bc8-55add5a7f41d.gif/size/"></p>

<p>Similar jumpscare designs are also common in game scenes. In horror games, players usually perform a distracting task, such as finding items or solving puzzles, and the jumpscare will come at this unsuspecting moment. In the game <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, released in 2021, you can see players being startled by zombies that suddenly appear with the music while exploring. </p>

<p>At the end of 2023, a horror game <em>Lethal Company</em> exploded among game streamers, winning the Steam “Better With Friends” award of the year, and the highest daily views on Twitch reached 190,000. Kelsey Raynor, an editor at VG247, pointed out, “…although the blocky graphics may make the game seem incomparable to other horror masterpieces, <em>Lethal Company</em> still fascinates a large number of fans, and its weird aesthetics is obviously part of the game’s charm.” Gabriel Moss, an editor at IGN, also mentioned, “ <em>Lethal Company</em> is already a sensory miracle in a sense.” The success of <em>Lethal Company</em> is also due to jumpscares. In Twitch live broadcasts, you can often see streamers being scared by spiders that appear from nowhere while doing tasks. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we can also see players use the scene to artificially create some “jumpscares” to bring extra game fun: the Tianhai master hidden in the grass gives the unsuspecting Kurumi a little “surprise”. </p>

Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load"></a>I. Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load</h2><p>Generally speaking, the purpose of horror games is to allow players to experience thrills, and jumpscares achieve this by putting players in a state of physiological arousal: usually under the stimulation of jumpscares, players will experience increased heart rate, sweating, blinking, and heavier breathing. These physiological arousal responses are actually our body ensuring our safety when potential high-risk stimuli (such as gunshots) appear. For example, an increased heart rate is actually to improve our motor ability to avoid danger; blinking is to protect our vital visual organs; and sweating and heavier breathing are side effects of the sympathetic nervous system being upregulated.</p>
<p>One of the key factors influencing physiological arousal is cognitive load. Cognitive load refers to the proportion of the human brain’s information processing system that is occupied. The heavier the cognitive load, the less energy we have left to use.</p>
<p>Based on the influence of cognitive load on physiological arousal, researchers Thomas Terkildsen, Lene Engelst, and Mathias Clasen from Aarhus University in Denmark proposed the hypothesis that “cognitive load is also related to the final effect of jumpscares” and conducted a systematic study on this hypothesis. The researchers decided to simulate different levels of cognitive load through four memory training sessions of different difficulty levels, and to determine whether physiological arousal and psychological arousal were brought out by jumpscares by measuring electrodermal activity graphs and having players self-report their psychological responses.</p>
<h3 id="Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity"><a href="#Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity"></a>Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity</h3><p>In order to give the experiment participants an immersive experience, the researchers developed a high-fidelity graphic horror game using the Unity game engine. The researchers believe that developing a new game is necessary because this can ensure that the tasks used later to simulate different levels of cognitive load can be seamlessly integrated into the game and its narrative to maximize the realism of the research.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the player wakes up from a nightmare in a small, dimly lit room. With a loud knock on the metal door, a guard appears and tells the player that it is time for the test. The player is taken out of the room and along a long corridor with cells on both sides. The guard leading the way drags another guard out of the cell, covered in wounds and blood. Eventually, the player reaches the room next to the cell where the injured guard was seen. The layout of the entire room was inspired by a similar scene in the popular horror game <em>A Chair in a Room</em> by Wolf &amp; Wood. There is a blank Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)* on the table in the room, next to a small plastic container containing two pills. A doctor behind the glass window instructs the player through the intercom to take the pills and sit in the chair in the middle of the room to start the test. The projector on the wall starts to work… </p>

<p>* The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed by Professor Nasreddine in 2004 and is a rapid screening assessment tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The cognitive domains assessed include attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstract thinking, and calculation and orientation. The time it takes for a therapist to complete the MoCA assessment is approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load"><a href="#Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load" class="headerlink" title="Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load"></a>Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load</h3><p>After guiding the player to the task through the game, the researchers set up four cognitive load intensity environments for 60 players: zero cognitive load, low cognitive load, medium cognitive load, and high cognitive load. During the test, a series of different patterns will be shown to the players, and the players need to remember the position of the blue squares in the patterns. The rounds in which the blue squares to be memorized appear are incremented according to the cognitive load intensity group.</p>
<p>As the task progresses and the intensity increases, the distance between the patterns that the player needs to remember and the current time increases, the difficulty of memory gradually increases, and the player’s cognitive load also gradually increases. The jumpscare suddenly appears in this task: a grinning monster will yell and interrupt the current memory task, rushing to the player. </p>

<h3 id="Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results"><a href="#Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results" class="headerlink" title="Measurement Tools and Experimental Results"></a>Measurement Tools and Experimental Results</h3><p>In this experiment, the researchers mainly measured the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player’s self-reported psychological arousal:</strong> Measured using the Self-Assessment Manikin, a graphic-based questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective physiological arousal:</strong> Measured by electrodermal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Player’s subjective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured using the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured by the performance of completing the cognitive load task (accuracy and reaction time to choose the answer).</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment showed that the manipulation of cognitive load intensity was effective: both objective reaction time and subjective reports showed that cognitive load was indeed different under the four experimental task conditions. As cognitive load gradually increased in the four experimental conditions, the physiological arousal produced by the jumpscare also increased. This coincides with the hypothesis of the experiment.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the player’s self-reported psychological arousal did not change significantly with the change of cognitive load. The researchers said that this is likely because the reactions caused by jumpscares are difficult to detect through conscious awareness; there are also many other studies in related literature showing that emotional and physiological “stimulation” cannot be accurately captured by people in the form of self-reports. </p>

How to Better Apply “Jumpscares” in Game Design</h2><h3 id="Appropriate-Level-of-Scare"><a href="#Appropriate-Level-of-Scare" class="headerlink" title="Appropriate Level of Scare"></a>Appropriate Level of Scare</h3><p>For the game industry, the research by researchers at Aarhus University points out that unpleasant experiences in games can sometimes better allow players to gain pleasure, but it should be noted that when using negative emotions with unpleasant feelings, the scale should be grasped. The relationship between fear and pleasure is usually an inverted U-shape. Only when there is an appropriate amount of horror can the player experience be maximized. Too low or too high horror may be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Some overseas players have expressed problems on forums about the poor experience caused by horror games being too scary; for example, some players on Reddit said that Laura’s part in <em>The Evil Within</em> made them feel very tormented. In the use of jumpscares, the dosage also needs to be controlled. Some games will overuse this technique, which will cause the jumpscares to lose their effect over time; some players also said that the use of jumpscares in <em>Prey</em> is just right, and only one powerful scare is enough to make people remember it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F747fda51-09aa-4e45-98d4-fbf99952a999.webp/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2Fe7a07b4c-86c8-4e77-84d2-66c6d41412dd.webp/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios"><a href="#Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="Reasonable Usage Scenarios"></a>Reasonable Usage Scenarios</h3><p>In horror games, scaring players unexpectedly by letting them concentrate on puzzles, tasks, and other plots can greatly enhance the experience of horror. Game developers have already unintentionally applied this.</p>
<p>Of the more than 10,000 games under the “Horror” tag on the Steam store, more than 3,000 also have the “Puzzle” element tag. In the new game <em>Content Warning</em> released in 2024, the developers increased the cognitive load by letting players act as photographers in the game plot, enhancing the stimulation of horror scenes.</p>
<p>In horror games, the use of jumpscares is reasonable and natural, but how to use the jumpscare technique in non-horror themed games is relatively vague. In games where players can interact with the environment and other players, jumpscares can actually be used by players. Returning to the action of players hiding in the grass in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> mentioned at the beginning, it is precisely because the creations in the environment can be utilized that players are given room for self-expression and creation. When the cognitive load is high, the effect of this jumpscare will also be enhanced. Just as if a hidden player suddenly appears next to a player who is concentrating on picking up equipment, the effect of the jumpscare will be very strong. </p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The use of jumpscares is very extensive in games. A good jumpscare can make players feel excited and memorable. Researchers at Aarhus University proposed the hypothesis that the level of cognitive load will affect the player’s experience of jumpscares, and verified this hypothesis through a horror game combined with a memory test.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that the higher the cognitive load, the stronger the stimulation felt by the player when experiencing jumpscares. Based on this conclusion, we can more cleverly combine the plot, tasks, or puzzle-solving components in the game with jumpscares to bring players a more interesting game experience.</p>
