<p><em>“Ten minutes to start the game, two hours to customize the face.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a widely circulated saying among players in MMORPG games.</p>
<p>In recent years, the character customization system has gradually become a standard feature of role-playing games (RPG), and many players love it. What is the charm of character creation that makes players so obsessed? The Proteus effect mentions that when individuals are given different character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits.</p>
<p>In games with social attributes, this means that when players put on a custom game avatar, they will project their good expectations of themselves onto this avatar, and because of the beautiful appearance of the avatar, their behavior will tend to move closer to the avatar, and they will also tend to be more friendly and enthusiastic in game social interactions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F59a704da-9729-4e5e-9bba-41acc4cc99c0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Nowadays, the customization function of game character images is becoming increasingly refined, allowing players to infinitely approach their ideal game image through these highly free customizations.</p>
<p>From the early days when you could only change the face shape, hairstyle, and body shape from a given number of templates, the character creation system has evolved to be able to adjust parameters such as size, position, and rotation through hundreds of fine dimensions. The degree of detail is so great. At the same time, in addition to improving freedom and sophistication to meet the ultimate pursuit of character creation experts, this customization system has also created a threshold for novice character creators.</p>
<p>On the Internet, we mostly hear the voices of “experts” and hear their needs for character creation functions, while the voices of ordinary players are often ignored. To this end, we have summarized the real feedback of ordinary players in different game character creation tests, combined with game examples, and analyzed how to improve the experience of ordinary players in a complex character creation system.</p>
<h2 id="1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems"><a href="#1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems"></a>1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems</h2><p>The use of game character creation functions is roughly divided into two parts: preset selection and detailed character creation.</p>
<p>In the preset selection, you can choose your favorite style from the given options, directly use this style to enter the game, or enter detailed character creation; in detailed character creation, you can adjust the size, position, orientation, color, brightness and other parameters of each part of the face step by step. It is no exaggeration to say that there are a thousand parameter results for a thousand players, truly achieving the so-called thousand faces for a thousand people.</p>
<p>The detailed character creation of most games is divided into three major sections: shaping, makeup, and hairstyle.</p>
<p>The current facial shaping function can adjust the content that basically covers every muscle of the face. Take <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, there are as many as 36 subdivided modules in the facial shaping part alone, and each module has 4-6 parameter settings. Shaping mostly covers the face shape, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, and each part is subdivided into multiple sub-parts that can be adjusted. In the adjustment of eyebrows, in addition to large items such as eyebrow shape, eyebrow position on the face, and eyebrow distance, the position of the brow, middle brow, and brow tail are also open for custom adjustment. Moreover, <em>Revelation M</em> also features the addition of ear adjustments, where players can adjust the ear contour, angle, and sharpness. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F55affa0e-c07c-4304-af74-7cd4c45d16ce.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<p>The makeup system can add more personalized settings to the face on the basis of shaping, maximizing fashion and atmosphere. Makeup generally includes several core sections - eyebrow makeup, eyeliner and eyeshadow, eyelashes, colored contacts, blush, lip gloss, facial accessories, skin tone, or contouring and highlighting for the entire face. Players can customize the style, color, and concentration of the makeup in each part. In more refined games, it is even possible to adjust the local area separately to achieve color clashing and color mixing effects. It can be said that it is a one-to-one reproduction of the freedom of makeup in the real world. </p>

<p>The complexity of the hairstyle module is obviously much simpler than the previous two. The function of this module is mainly realized through preset styles, and players can choose from a given number of hairstyles to more than ten. In some games with a high degree of freedom, players can customize the length of the hairstyle, the position of the braids, etc., and the hair color can also be adjusted through the full-color gamut color wheel, and even gradient colors can be set. Whether it is a dazzling two-dimensional or ordinary black, brown and gray, you can find your own spectrum. </p>

<h2 id="2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System"><a href="#2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System" class="headerlink" title="2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System"></a>2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System</h2><p>After the above review, everyone will clearly find that although it is just a simple “character creation”, the content covered is very rich. Accompanying such a high degree of freedom is often a high threshold; the more customizable options there are, the more difficult it is for players to find their own direction.</p>
<p>In user research, more than one player has told us: “I will also create the face, but in the end, I use the preset or directly buy the image. I really can’t create it. I can be serious at the beginning, but I get bored later. I feel that what I create is not good-looking, so I might as well buy it.”</p>
<p>Most ordinary players will express it very kindly, “It’s my own problem, I don’t know how to create, for people who are厲害 (lì hai - awesome), high freedom is very good.” But in the actual experience, their feelings of embarrassment and helplessness, and the lack of confidence due to the frustration of character creation, are also real.</p>
<p>In detail, under the high threshold brought by high freedom, ordinary players (or non-expert character creators) may face the following dilemmas when using the custom appearance function.</p>
<p><strong>The first dilemma:</strong> The naming of each facial structure in the high-freedom character creation system is too professional, and there is a certain knowledge threshold. In a highly free character creation system, a face can be divided into dozens of components. For example, the facial contour is divided into: forehead, temples, apple cheeks, cheekbones, cheeks, upper jaw, lower jaw, jaw angle, chin, etc., which are all professional names for human facial muscle structure or makeup. Each part also has a variety of adjustment methods. Players who are not familiar with these on a daily basis will inevitably feel confused, “What is this? What is that? They are too similar.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F46f71505-699d-4f51-9455-c187a001403d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without sufficient character creation experience, players often need to spend more time to check and try one by one to understand which area each block is in charge of. In such a high cognitive load scenario, it is also necessary to spend extra mental effort to try to get started, and the final combination effect may not be satisfactory. The joy of DIY may not be so pure.</p>
<p><strong>The second dilemma:</strong> Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament and effect. Just like people who don’t pay attention to makeup don’t know how to apply highlights and contour, or how to draw eyeliner and eyeshadow when they first learn makeup to achieve a pure and lovely or cold and domineering temperament. The same is true for novice&#x2F;entry-level players who are not character creation experts: lack of aesthetic knowledge, it will be difficult to get started.</p>
<p>For example, cuteness generally means that there should be some youthful features on the face, such as a short face, large eyes, a smaller proportion of the upper court, and a relatively full expression of soft tissues; purity requires a certain bluntness of the five senses. If there are more acute angles in the five senses, the feeling of shrewdness is more prominent, and it is not easy to show a pure temperament. Players without this basic knowledge of facial aesthetics will find it difficult to land the temperament they prefer in their hearts on the design (character creation) of specific parts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F26010507-2caf-4f7b-897d-4d98536d38c4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Facial aesthetic standards of three courts and five eyes</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The third dilemma:</strong> Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the parts they create is far from the target face. Based on the experience of looking at faces before, players will have their own preferences for the specific appearance of some facial features, but the overall aesthetic control of the face is relatively vague. When players painstakingly adjust each one for a long time, and finally create the desired oval face, smiling eyes, and sexy lips, they find that although each part is roughly what they want and looks good, the whole face is not coordinated and beautiful enough. At this time, to modify, they will issue painful entanglements of “I don’t know where to start”, “What changes can make the face harmonious and distinctive”, and “Do I still want to enter the game”.</p>

When it comes to the specific character creation system settings, the solutions can be divided into the following types of functions.</p>
<h3 id="Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level"><a href="#Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level" class="headerlink" title="Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level."></a>Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level.</h3><p>Generally speaking, the section division in the simple mode is more general, and there will be fewer adjustable parameters, which is suitable for players who pursue the overall effect but do not like to抠细节 (kōu xì jié - fuss over details); the expert mode has a more detailed division and more adjustable parameters, which is suitable for character creation professionals who pursue high precision. Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. In the simple mode, you only need to select the sample and overall parameter adjustment for the face and facial features, while the expert mode can adjust the parameters of each subdivided area of the facial features, including displacement, rotation, and zoom. Players can freely switch between the two modes to meet different application scenarios, which is more flexible. </p>

<li><strong>Prepare several preset faces, preset eye shapes, eyebrow shapes, lip shapes, etc.</strong> Players can create exquisite faces just by combining various templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>New Fantasy Zhu Xian</em> as an example. When entering the character creation system, players can choose from nearly ten preset faces with different facial features and hairstyles. After selecting the preset face, they can also choose from more than a dozen facial styles with different facial features and temperaments. This choice can help players quickly locate the overall effect they want. In <em>Life Makeover</em>, not only are there preset faces for players to choose from, but each facial feature and makeup section also has a large number of preset styles to choose from. Players can even obtain an exquisite face without making any parameter adjustments, just by combining various facial feature styles. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Random character creation</strong>, you can directly choose the one you like the most among a large number of randomly generated appearances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. Players can use the random function to choose from a large number of appearances, and pick the one that surprises them the most among these “blind boxes”. However, the randomly generated results of some games may have uneven quality, and players may need to spend more time if they want to get a satisfactory appearance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fffd16876-b55c-4e16-8b9f-6c2aa41f9aa6.png/size/"></p>

<li><strong>Character creation sharing hall or character creation code</strong>, players can directly quote popular face templates in the in-game sharing hall, or obtain a sharing code on the external sharing platform for one-click import.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> as an example. If players do not want to create their own faces, they can also directly enter the “Master Character Creation” sharing hall, where players can choose works that match their aesthetics according to body type and temperament labels, and import them with one click. If you want to copy a high-value face on the external social platform of the game, you can also import it with one click through the character creation sharing code, eliminating the trouble of step-by-step fine-tuning according to the tutorial, which is a lazy person’s happiness code. </p>

<li><strong>Temperament concept character creation</strong>, players can choose the desired temperament effect through the wheel, and the system will automatically adjust the facial structure to present it in a direction that matches the temperament type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, players can move between the four temperament dimensions of “immortal”, “childish”, “gentle”, and “fierce” through the temperament wheel. This intuitive change in the concept of temperament can quickly help players determine what kind of face they want. When you want a pure and childish little junior sister face, you only need to drag the wheel to move in the direction of “childish” to roughly achieve it. </p>

At the same time, some games will also have built-in functions to restore the initial and reset the current part (such as <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>), so that players can directly reset a part of the area or the whole with one click when they are not satisfied, and clear and restart at any time. In addition, some games also have the functions of “import” and “export”. For example, in <em>Life Makeover</em>, players can export each step of the operation in real time, and then import and read the file with one click for “repentance” or to restart at any time after interrupting the character creation. </p>

<li><strong>Photo character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Through photo intelligent character creation, the system can read the pictures of the player himself, celebrities, or even two-dimensional characters, and quickly produce a similar face in a few seconds. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, you only need to upload a photo, and the system can generate a character image with a hairstyle and makeup that matches the photo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2aa2f7a4-7c13-474a-8caf-f8ddf93ab605.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Photo character creation function in 《Justice Online Mobile》, both hairstyle and makeup have been adapted</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time AR expression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In some games equipped with AR scanning, players only need to turn on the camera, and the character’s expression will change in real time according to the player, such as smiling or squinting, and every frown and smile will move with the player.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The text character creation function of <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> makes game character creation easier. Players only need to spend a few seconds to enter some adjectives or the names of celebrities. With the support of AI’s black technology, they only need 1 second of cloud computing to turn the fantasy in the player’s mind or the image of their favorite celebrity into real character creation data in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, players can even enter more abstract verses. For example, directly enter “云想衣裳花想容，春风拂槛露华浓” (yún xiǎng yī shang huā xiǎng róng, chūn fēng fú kǎn lù huá nóng), and the player will get the prototype of Yang Guifei. If you really can’t think of descriptive text, there is also a random text function. Click random to generate the corresponding character image according to a large number of verses, truly realizing lazy character creation in one step. </p>

<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The character image customization function in RPG games is gradually becoming more and more powerful, but high freedom is often accompanied by high thresholds, which brings a series of experience difficulties to non-expert players:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many and specialized muscle&#x2F;makeup names have a certain knowledge threshold;</li>
<li>Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament effect;</li>
<li>Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the created parts is far from the target face.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the difficulties encountered by non-expert players in the user research conclusions, game developers have taken some measures to reduce the operational and knowledge barriers, so that they can also enjoy the joy of character creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level;</li>
<li>Provide a large number of optional templates to help players locate the desired overall effect. For example, provide preset faces and preset part styles; random character creation, character creation sharing hall, or character creation code import; temperament concept character creation, etc.</li>
<li>Set the functions of reset, undo, restore, and save to reduce the cost of trial and error for players.</li>
<li>With the assistance of AI technology, help players complete the visualization and specific operations of concepts into pictures, and create the target face they want in one step. For example, photo character creation, AR expressions, text character creation, etc.</li>
