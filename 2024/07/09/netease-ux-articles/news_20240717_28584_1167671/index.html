Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?"></a>I. Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?</h2><p>Unlike traditional paper maps, the icon design in the game map interface needs to include various forms of content other than geographical location information. The following list basically encompasses all icons that may appear in an open-world map interface.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular locations:</strong> Mark locations in the game world that players can explore.</li>
<li><strong>Character&#x2F;Important item locations:</strong> Indicate the current location or direction of characters or important items.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Travel points:</strong> Allow players to teleport directly from their current location to the indicated location.</li>
<li><strong>Reminder markers:</strong> Alert players to unfinished tasks or unclaimed items.</li>
<li><strong>User-defined markers:</strong> In some games, players can choose an icon provided by the map system to mark a specific location.</li>
<li><strong>Direction indicators:</strong> Crucial in vast environments; some maps have compass-like icons.</li>
<li><strong>Crosshair and cursor:</strong> Tools for selecting locations, commonly used in maps navigated with a controller or keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>External map information:</strong> Provides details such as longitude and latitude, weather, and time.</li>
</ul>

Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?"></a>II. Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?</h2><p>Virtual game environments, similar to real-world scenes, interact with people through various “touch points”.</p>
<p>In a game scene, touch points can be various special scenes, objects, or characters (like NPCs). Maps typically present these touch points to the player in a 2D or 2.5D format. When players switch from the map interface back to the 3D game scene, a sense of disconnect is inevitable. Therefore, the higher the usability of the icons, the more players can focus their attention on the game scene, enhancing their immersive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately"><a href="#Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately" class="headerlink" title="Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately"></a>Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately</h3><p>To avoid players repeatedly switching between the map and the game scene to confirm information, ensuring a continuous gameplay experience, developers need to make it easy for players to understand the connection between map icons and touch points in the game scene.</p>
<p>The essence of icon design lies in symbol selection. Appropriate symbols make it easier for players to understand the meaning of icons, thus making their meanings easier to comprehend. Additionally, icon materials should align with the game world’s setting, ensuring clarity while considering the narrative.</p>
<p>For example, consider icons with a “teleport” function. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the teleport icon (fast travel) resembles a location marker on a modern map. In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the teleport icon is based on the shrines in Hyrule. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, the teleport icon (Site of Grace) is drawn from the actual Site of Grace in the game world. These icons not only allow players to quickly understand their meaning but also enhance the game’s narrative. </p>

Adding text prompts to icons is the simplest way to enhance learnability.</p>
<p>Firstly, text content should minimize redundant information, as extra text doesn’t exist in the real world, and excessive text descriptions disrupt the player’s sense of realism and immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6c8304e6-4eef-4dfe-a229-2e7ac86f66cf.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, only a keyboard icon and the word “Teleport” are used as an instruction.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Secondly, ensure that text prompts are visually easy to read, reducing the player’s visual load and improving reading efficiency. The text’s presentation should also be consistent in design with text in other game interfaces, ensuring that the text system as a whole is easily understood by players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fbff87078-fcf5-4c1b-ae43-880cb5c8696e.webp/size/"></p>

Players mainly interact with icons using a mouse, keyboard, or controller thumbstick (excluding tablet games for now). Therefore, icon size is a crucial factor in determining operability.</p>
<p>Obviously, larger icons are easier to select. However, to display as much information as possible and avoid excessively large icons affecting the player’s visual and operational experience, icon design must first determine its activation area.</p>
<p>In the most common interface where a mouse is used to select icons, due to the mouse’s high precision and speed, icons can have a smaller activation area to increase overall map information density.  When using a keyboard or controller thumbstick, the selection process is more complex, requiring larger icon activation areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7e3f4713-a98f-4e09-b63d-7c04b10e93f9.webp/size/"></p>

For example, in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, a persistent selection box at the map’s center automatically magnifies or snaps to nearby icons. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F21c29c80-b14c-445a-86b3-0ec663d19bd0.gif/size/"></p>

Developers must first strike a balance between conveying information and providing an immersive experience, then determine how to make icons appropriately attractive.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, icons have low attractiveness, blending closely with the map background. Players must focus more on identifying terrain features (like mountains and rivers), inadvertently building a stronger macroscopic memory of the game environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F872974c8-47be-4fd1-ae53-082f31d17989.webp/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2 Map</em></p>

<p>In contrast, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, icons are far more prominent than the background. Players can quickly focus on target locations, while similar-looking buildings in the background are often overlooked while browsing the map. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fd15f4055-ee5f-4584-9420-cb956dac2685.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>Furthermore, the attractiveness of different icon categories should be differentiated. Levels should be assigned based on factors like access frequency and contribution to game progress. However, too many levels can lead to sorting confusion. More levels also imply a wider range of visual weights, potentially making some icons too jarring or too subtle, increasing the player’s visual burden. Typically, icon attractiveness levels should not exceed four. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F22c42936-10bb-4f5c-a250-19701fe25761.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Attractiveness level division of icons in Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p>

<p>Visual weight determines the differences in attractiveness between icons. Generally, irregular shapes, strong color contrast with the background, and effects like glow, shadow, or animation increase an icon’s visual weight.</p>

Beyond Symbols: How to Give Icons Functionality?</h2><p>Icon functionality determines the player’s efficiency in exploring the game world and can even impact gameplay mechanics. Open worlds offer rich details for players to discover. The map, as a crucial tool, should provide players with appropriate functions to enhance their experience.</p>
<h3 id="Unleashing-Player-Customization-Achieving-Exploration-Freedom"><a href="#Unleashing-Player-Customization-Achieving-Exploration-Freedom" class="headerlink" title="Unleashing Player Customization, Achieving Exploration Freedom"></a>Unleashing Player Customization, Achieving Exploration Freedom</h3><p>Games and movies share core elements – presenting stories to players&#x2F;viewers. Linear level design in traditional games is akin to a movie edited by a “director” and presented to an audience; players passively receive the story. Open worlds, however, require players to actively explore the story. Each player has a unique exploration style and journey, which is the charm of open-world games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fd144ff27-859c-47a7-baf5-a842ee4bc7f1.webp/size/"></p>

<p><em>The difference in story exploration between open-world games and traditional games (schematic). The right side represents an open world.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In open worlds, maps not only convey location information but also indicate level information and provide players with task lists. To allow for a free exploration experience, the map interface should sometimes allow players to add custom markers, granting them the power to set goals and determine their progress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6aad2e0a-f8b6-4468-a16e-ea7fa04d2c9a.gif/size/"></p>

<p>During their exploration, different players will ultimately create unique maps. Players project their personality, preferences, and emotions onto the map, forming a personal profile. Some might use stamps to mark important resource points, while others might highlight scenic or interesting locations. Each player’s unique map becomes a vessel for their experiences and memories after completing the game.</p>
<h3 id="Interacting-with-the-Game-Scene-Breaking-Down-Interface-Barriers"><a href="#Interacting-with-the-Game-Scene-Breaking-Down-Interface-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Interacting with the Game Scene, Breaking Down Interface Barriers"></a>Interacting with the Game Scene, Breaking Down Interface Barriers</h3><p>Based on the correlation between map icons and player actions in the game scene, icons can be categorized. The least correlated and most common icons provide location information, usually presenting scene details to the player through images and text. Next are teleportation points; players select and click an icon to travel to the corresponding location. The most strongly correlated icons are location markers. Since players need to find the marked location in the scene, the design of these icons must closely integrate with markers within the scene.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, players have six differently colored map pins to mark locations. When switching to the game scene, using the telescope reveals corresponding colored light pillars, guiding the character to the marked location.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the design of these icons is inspired by the light pillars in the scene, enhancing clarity and integrating well with the environment. Furthermore, the glowing effect on the icons mirrors the light effects in the scene. </p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Game icon design is not just simple art creation and interface layout; it’s a process for developers to delve deeper into the game world and the player’s inner self. It’s about achieving a beautiful interface and efficient information delivery while aligning with the game world’s worldview, collectively touching the player’s heart.</p>
<p>Only by refining icon design from multiple dimensions can we provide players with the most immersive, unique, and unforgettable gaming experience.</p>
