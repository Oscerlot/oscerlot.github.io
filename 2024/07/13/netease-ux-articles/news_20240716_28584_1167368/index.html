<p>From the Barbie doll, popular in the toy market in 1959 for its interchangeable clothing, to the QQ Show, familiar to Generation Z, with its customizable outfits and interactive expressions, and from early single-player dress-up games with fixed character images and clothing to highly customizable online character creation systems with hundreds of body parameters. The game format of dressing up characters has been popular from the beginning, and after becoming a virtual avatar online, it has developed rapidly due to its freedom of appearance customization, and has gained a lot of attention and recognition from players. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Early Barbie dolls with various career images</em></p>

<p>In 2023, after the first cloud character creation experience of <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game was launched, it set a record for simultaneous online players within ten minutes. The topic of “part-time game character creators earning over 10,000 yuan per month” was once on the Weibo hot list, attracting widespread attention and discussion. The hottest character creation data in the official character creation station has more than 50,000 downloads, and the sharing and exchange of character creation data among active players in social media has become a daily routine, which shows that there is a huge demand for character creation among players in the game.</p>
<p>Why can character creation, as a form of shaping virtual images, trigger a player experience frenzy and demand far beyond everyone’s expectations? It is also worth thinking about why selling game fashion and appearances has become a business model accepted by players around the world. Why are players willing to pay for some high-quality and exquisite fashion that can only be worn in virtual images?</p>
<p>Next, this article will start from the psychological connection between the player and the game character, and analyze the reasons why players are so concerned about the fashion, character creation and other appearances of game characters.</p>
<h2 id="I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars"><a href="#I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars" class="headerlink" title="I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars"></a>I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars</h2><p>The avatar identification theory proposes that in the game environment, players project their self-identity onto the game character through interaction with the game character, forming a special psychological connection.</p>
<h3 id="The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar"><a href="#The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="The Origin of the Term Avatar"></a>The Origin of the Term Avatar</h3><p>The original Zelda game first allowed players to customize the protagonist’s name, and subsequent games gradually began to allow players to customize the protagonist’s clothing and appearance. Later, it was collectively referred to as: Avatar system. The word Avatar comes from Sanskrit. In Hinduism, Avatar is a special ability user who can change his image, and is generally regarded as the image of gods in the human world. That is to say, the game character, that is, the avatar, is the digital representation of the player, and the player imagines and experiences the emotions and viewpoints of the character from the game character.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-and-Projection"><a href="#Avatar-and-Projection" class="headerlink" title="Avatar and Projection"></a>Avatar and Projection</h3><p>Freud’s theory of personality structure believes that a person is composed of three parts: id, ego, and superego. The “id” follows the pleasure principle and contains a group of chaotic, instinctive, and suppressed desires. The “ego” follows the reality principle and satisfies the needs of the id under the conditions of real environment and moral standards. The “superego” follows the moral principle and contains moral ideals and conscience.</p>
<p>However, in real life, many desires of the id are restricted and cannot be realized. For example, office workers cannot travel and enjoy the beautiful mountains and rivers as they wish, but they can log in to the <em>Justice Online</em> game in their spare time and explore mountains and rivers in the dreamy and beautiful environment, so that their leisure exploration desires can be satisfied in another way. </p>

<p>The same is true in terms of appearance. For example, the <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game fashion [Star Palace] Pegasus skirt’s elegant and gorgeous design and court style can enable players to realize the dream of becoming a gorgeous female star that is difficult to achieve in daily life. It is the existence of a virtual avatar. It allows the desires for unfulfilled behaviors and appearances to have an object of projection and another possibility of realization. </p>

<h2 id="II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification"></a>II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification</h2><p>Studies have shown that avatars are not only seen as characters temporarily manipulated by players, but players also regard avatars as part of their self-concept. So how does this psychological connection explain players’ obsession with appearance and character creation?</p>
<p>The similarity between the virtual avatar and the player in terms of physical appearance, personality characteristics, race, etc. can promote the realization of avatar identification. When players choose or customize virtual images in the game, they are often based on the psychological mechanism of self-identification and projection. They hope to show their personality, interests, or ideal self through the character image in the game. This is why most players’ game character creation results have characteristics that are in line with their own aesthetics and character style settings</p>
<p>The game has developed a function in the character creation module that allows intelligent character creation based on pictures uploaded by players, allowing players who are not good at character creation to restore their beauty in the game with the help of AI tools. In addition, many players upload not photos of celebrity beauties, but their own photos. In the game, players actually carry out a kind of emotional projection by choosing or customizing the appearance of the character. With the support of AI technology and the addition of exquisite costumes in game design, virtual characters can be infinitely close to a player’s ideal image of themselves. What players project is the beautiful image they want to become, as players say: “Pinch yourself into a beautification, and what you pinch out is what I hope to grow into.. </p>

<h2 id="III-Specific-Appearance-is-a-Mask-to-Switch-Identities"><a href="#III-Specific-Appearance-is-a-Mask-to-Switch-Identities" class="headerlink" title="III. Specific Appearance is a Mask to Switch Identities"></a>III. Specific Appearance is a Mask to Switch Identities</h2><p>In the virtual world of online games, players project the desires they want to satisfy in the id, and the images they have not pursued in reality, onto the avatar.</p>
<h3 id="The-Proteus-Effect"><a href="#The-Proteus-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Proteus Effect"></a>The Proteus Effect</h3><p>The Proteus effect shows that when individuals are given specific character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits. This phenomenon originally came from the sea god Proteus in ancient Greek mythology, who had the ability to change his appearance, so the word “Proteus” is also used to refer to “ready to change shape and personality at any time”. In the game, by choosing or customizing the appearance and dress of the character, the player is actually setting a specific character image for himself, and showing the corresponding behavior pattern under this image.</p>
<h3 id="The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image"><a href="#The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="The Mask Function of Character Image"></a>The Mask Function of Character Image</h3><p>We can regard such a specific appearance image as a kind of “mask”, which is a symbol and sense of ritual to switch identities, and it is also a prop to increase the immersion of the new identity. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a national style martial arts game, in addition to the antique scenes, the ancient style appearance of the characters also allows players to quickly feel that they can travel to ancient times, and Ning Hongye’s blindfolded cloth strips and capable and neat fashion can also allow players to substitute into a brave and decisive swordsman identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F36a6b2fb-cdc3-47f4-9d7c-9e6e15be79ee.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Ning Hongye</em></p>
<hr>
<p>And when this “mask” does not meet the player’s conditions for identity setting, there will be a sense of incongruity. Therefore, in the design of game fashion, not only should we start from the era background and identity of the game character itself, but also combine the player’s inherent cognition of the character or a certain type of image to think.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Game characters are players’ virtual avatars in another world. Appearance customization and other features can promote players’ identification with the avatar. Players will invest their imagination of their ideal self in the avatar. Different appearance images are like a mask, allowing players to be more deeply immersed in the role of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, such projection cannot explain all players’ appearance settings for game characters. Perhaps in the eyes of some players, game character creation and fashion matching are a way of personalized self-expression. By choosing different appearances and dresses, players can show their uniqueness and creativity.</p>
