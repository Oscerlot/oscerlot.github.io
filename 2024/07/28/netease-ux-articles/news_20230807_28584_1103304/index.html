<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In RPG games, you usually play a certain character in the game, and this character brings you into a brand new virtual world.</p>
<p>By taking on this role, you can explore this virtual world, interact with other NPCs, experience various ups and downs, twists and turns of stories and adventures; constantly think about various puzzles in the game, find the best solution, promote the development of the game plot, and obtain various upgrades of the character.</p>
<h2 id="1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating</h2><p>The game protagonist played by the player usually has two typical images, one is immersive, and the other is a blank slate.</p>
<h3 id="Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion"><a href="#Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)"></a>Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)</h3><p>Most of the earliest RPG games had immersive protagonists.</p>
<p>This kind of protagonist has unique character settings and thinking modes, and the game plot will also deeply portray their background stories, character relationships, and personality traits. The protagonist will express their likes and dislikes, opinions, and actively take many actions in various event dialogues. Players cannot change the appearance and name of the protagonist, such as Li Xiaoyao in “Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy” and Link in “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”. When playing this type of game, the player’s experience is closer to interactive movies and TV.</p>
<p>Another type of immersive protagonist is the character that can be switched into during the game process, such as in “Revelation M”. Players can switch into other characters to explore the map and battle, and these characters also have unique personalities and backgrounds. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/a83fb212-a71d-4477-a193-cfb0067dfd48.png" alt="《Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy》 RPG series game first generation"></p>
<h3 id="Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)"></a>Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)</h3><p>The biggest feature of this type of character is the lack of personality. The background story line is complete but rarely portrayed; they rarely express opinions in plot dialogues, and even if there are opinions, there are branch options. Many characters do not have voice acting, such as Lumine in “Genshin Impact”. Everyone knows that she is a traveler from a foreign land, but it is difficult to say what kind of person she is.</p>
<p>An American cartoonist, Scott McCloud’s, point is that “the fewer details a character has, the more likely readers are to project themselves into that character.” Many games now allow players to customize the appearance attributes of the protagonist, such as face customization, hair dyeing, and even body customization, but they still cannot provide customized personal plots for all types of “player avatars”. Therefore, blank slate protagonists usually cannot have obvious personality traits.</p>
<p>The original intention of the blank slate protagonist is to allow players to immerse themselves in the game world. But in actual contact with players, we found that among the blank slate protagonists, a large number of players do not immerse themselves in the role, whether it is an MMORPG that emphasizes the experience of the virtual world or an otome game that emphasizes immersion.</p>
<p>For example, in MMORPGs, many male players choose to play female characters, not because they want to experience the plot or battle from the perspective of a female character, but simply because they think the female character is better-looking. In otome games, many female players do not substitute themselves for the protagonist and date the virtual characters, but use the protagonist’s eyes as a camera, go through the plot, and watch the relationships, just like reading a novel or watching a drama. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/44b30c9a-1722-4d02-ad36-0f661cee3d45.png" alt="Selection interface in Justice Online mobile game."></p>
<p>These types of players can be called spectator-perspective players.</p>
<p>The spectator perspective has no personality characteristics and no character restrictions. The protagonist can be imagined as anyone. For example, adult players will choose to play loli characters and raise them as daughters, while male players playing female characters may project the expected female personality and appearance.</p>
<p>Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating, to put it simply, immersion is to experience the love, hate, and stories of someone else; Role-Playing is to put yourself in the role of the protagonist and personally experience the joys and sorrows of this world; Spectating is to use the perspective of the protagonist as a camera to observe the stories that happen in this world, and the protagonist has little to do with the story itself.</p>
<h2 id="2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions"><a href="#2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions" class="headerlink" title="2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions"></a>2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions</h2><p>Different game protagonists’ self-involvement methods not only affect the player’s plot experience, but more interestingly, we found that these three involvement methods will have completely different effects on the player’s fashion purchase decisions.</p>
<h3 id="Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes"><a href="#Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes" class="headerlink" title="Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes"></a>Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes</h3><p>Take the two dress-up games “Shining Nikki” and “Life Makeover” as examples:</p>
<p>“Shining Nikki” adopts a typical immersive protagonist. There is a very vivid description of Nikki on the Internet. “Su Nikki, an ordinary person who can’t help staying up late and likes to hum even though she sings out of tune, is enthusiastic to everyone and comes to a strange world. Watching the world collapse in front of her, she constantly tries to save the world several times. Facing the separation from her parents and the betrayal of her friends, she can still be kind and full of vitality.”</p>
<p>“Life Makeover” uses a blank slate protagonist. Players can personalize the name, face, and even height and body shape of the protagonist. As for the protagonist herself, her background story also revolves around her sister. Her sister is a private detective, and there is very little description of the protagonist herself.</p>
<p>The advantage of the blank slate protagonist is that it can meet more diverse needs of substitution or viewing, but it is also difficult to generate empathy due to the lack of character details and distinct personality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Angel and Devil set PV on the first anniversary of “Shining Nikki” became popular and resonated with many old Nikki players, who returned to the game; the main point of popularity was the plot. This set of clothes was given special meaning by the plot, so many people empathized and collected it. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/7f160228-3f16-40a9-ab49-91991d91cb33.png" alt="Fan-made rendition of Shining Nikki’s Angel and Devil set that commemorates its first anniversary."></p>
<p>The first six-star limited-time set of “Life Makeover” - Snow Heavy Glory, although there is also a high-quality fashion PV, on social platforms, most people’s attention is only on whether the fashion is beautiful, and few people pay attention to the theme story behind the fashion. For many people, it is just a beautiful six-star appearance. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/0c511e02-d45e-48a4-ab56-b995184cf3bc.png" alt="Life Makeover’s first limited-time set, Snow Heavy Glory."></p>
<p>In game fashion design, the theme is a very important part. Like “Shining Nikki”, the plot can give clothes a special meaning, making many people empathize and collect them, bringing added value to fashion.</p>
<p>In MMO games, the protagonist is usually a blank slate, and the theme value of game fashion is often completed through collaboration, which is the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>For example, the Little Prince and Rose set, which has high sales in “Revelation M”, is based on the classic plot of The Little Prince; when the double ponytail was just launched, many players also began to cosplay Sailor Moon. Recently, the Green Snake set, which is very popular in “Justice Online Mobile”, its interactive action is a restoration of a very classic scene in the movie Green Snake, making players exclaim: It’s so thematic. </p>
<p>![The Little Prince and the Rose Set in Revelation Mobile.](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/d22e9db0-07c5-4ea1-b89b-028aa2dc27e1.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/d22e9db0-07c5-4ea1-b89b-028aa2dc27e1.png</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/a079a928-332a-4568-82df-84b2a03b8712.png" alt="The Green Snake Set in Justice Online Mobile."></p>
<p>In the above two cases, the added value of the theme to fashion is achieved through the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>In MMO games, if the theme is to give fashion special meaning, first of all, this theme must have a three-dimensional&#x2F;highly recognizable character, and be accompanied by an attractive plot, such as the Little Prince, Green Snake, Fa Hai, etc. Simply giving fashion a theme plot atmosphere without character setting, it is difficult for players to empathize and collect. In addition, it is also necessary to consider the role that players want to substitute, for example, in the theme of Journey to the West, female players will definitely want to substitute the Jade Rabbit, not Sun Wukong.</p>
<h3 id="Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating</h3><p>Players who substitute themselves generally choose the same gender role. When going through the plot or participating in game activities, in order to better substitute into the plot situation, they often dress themselves up and wear fashion that matches the plot to go through the plot. This is more obvious in the Japanese player research. More Japanese players are substituting themselves when playing MMO games. Fashion matching the theme of the expansion pack can attract these players, and they are also more likely to buy fashion because they want to participate in the plot or activities of the expansion pack. </p>
<p><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230807/b48377de-0771-4f70-8226-f2c62a450911.jpg" alt="The “Tide Light” faction fashion of “Justice Online”&#39;s large-scale expansion pack “Bihai Chaoguang”."></p>
<p>For spectator players, since the character has no obvious personality characteristics under the spectator perspective, players do not substitute themselves, and there are no restrictions on fixed character settings. They can easily imagine the protagonist as anyone, and switch between protagonists of different genders and ages without burden. At the same time, they also have no fixed character choice constraints, and there is no pressure to switch between different styles of characters. This part of the players will have more diverse choices.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the lack of substitution needs, fashion launched in conjunction with the plot and activities of the expansion pack may not necessarily empower fashion. For these players, choosing beautiful clothes to go through the plot is a higher priority than choosing suitable clothes to go through the plot. They project the personality and appearance of the male&#x2F;female they expect in their hearts onto the character. Therefore, in terms of fashion choices, they are more inclined to styles that meet their own group or other groups’ expectations and preferences. For example, in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in China, fairy and sexy are ranked at the top, while in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in Japan, gentleness is ranked at the top. This is also relatively close to the personality expectations of adult women in different social environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Immersion is experiencing the story, substitution is personal experience, and viewing is observing the story. The relationship between different involvement methods and fashion is: In blank slate character games, players who substitute and players who view need to be treated differently. Players who substitute are more suitable for designing theme role-playing fashion, and viewers pay more attention to the beauty and universal aesthetics of fashion. The same is the immersive way of involvement. The theme gives fashion highly recognizable characters and attractive plots. For example, collaborating with other themes outside the game can give fashion a deeper meaning and purchase attraction.</p>
