<p>&nbsp;<br>“Words have power, words are power, words could be your power.” — Mohammed Qahtani</p>
<p>In the process of games going global, we often rely on two types of text to communicate directly with players: one is in-game text; the other is communication within the community. These two types of discourse need to fully express the game maker’s game concept, creative ideas, and in-depth thinking, to avoid causing unintended discrimination and prejudice among players.</p>
<p>The game market research agency Newzoo once launched a player sentiment study on more than 1,500 people and released a report saying that diversity, fairness, and inclusion are becoming increasingly important in games. Many players do not necessarily feel a sense of belonging in the game or feel welcome in the game community, and these current situations are closely related to the use of inclusive language. This article will introduce inclusive language and its use in the game localization process.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process"><a href="#1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?"></a>1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?</h2><p>Inclusive language aims to avoid “expressions that express or imply ideas that are sexist, racist, or otherwise biased, prejudiced, or denigrating to any particular group of people.”</p>
<p>Inclusive language is based on the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI principles). It strives to avoid expressing or implying prejudice against any particular group of people, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups, and does not contain any content that may imply that a person is superior to another because of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability, or health status.</p>
<p>When we serve players from different backgrounds and of different types, of course, the producers do not want to form an opposition with a certain group because of this unnecessary or unintended language offense, which will have a bad impact on the game. It is a terrible consequence for the game to be opposed and boycotted, so it is particularly important to create an inclusive and diverse game environment and game community.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve"><a href="#2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve" class="headerlink" title="2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?"></a>2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?</h2><p>The definition of euphemism is “the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant”. If the localization team does not know what is offensive or what is unpleasant, the definition of euphemism becomes problematic.</p>
<p>And with cultural shifts, some originally “safe words” may also be introduced with risks. For example, the word “genius” has also been listed among words with gender inequality, class, and racial assumptions.</p>
<p>A recent interesting example discussed gender-inclusive solutions related to the nouns “mother” and “father”, suggesting the use of “gestational parent” and “non-birthing parent” instead. </p>

<p><em>Twitter officially released some “problem words” and recommended replacement words</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sensitive vocabulary mentioned above has also rapidly changed all aspects of game products. To avoid gender-sensitive words, EA went a step further in <em>The Sims 4</em> and directly removed the binary male and female categories from the creation menu. The localization practice of <em>The Sims 4</em> is also simple and effective: use non-gender-specific terms (for example, use “Police officer” instead of “Policeman” when describing “police”); look for neutral structures. </p>

Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices"></a>3. Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices</h2><p>In fact, many schools, publishing houses, etc. will organize “language guides” to serve diverse communities. Taking the “inclusive language guide” newly released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington in 2022 as an example, “problem words” are divided into four categories: racial, ethnic, national, religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native discrimination; disability discrimination; age discrimination; and gender and sexual orientation discrimination. When applied to games, we can also refer to them. The following are the problems that are prone to occur in each category.</p>
<h3 id="Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio"><a href="#Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio" class="headerlink" title="Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio."></a>Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio.</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/a4938950-ba42-457f-8724-76092fa6aff5.png"></p>

Associating white people with good and black people with evil is called the “black is black effect”. Muhammad Ali said in an interview in the 1980s: “…we got some things called White House cigars, White Swan soap, King White soap, White Cloud tissue… Angel food is white cake, and devil’s food is chocolate cake.”</p>
<p>Black and white are often considered to be derivatives of racist metaphors, with “black” representing undesirable, wrong, or bad things; “white” represents desirable, correct, and good things. These words perpetuate the concepts once used to oppress people of color. So in games, common inclusive language for term replacement includes: whitelist (changed to allowlist), blacklist (changed to blocklist), etc. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/ef688944-7b9a-47c5-af8d-0cb87943a6c7.png"></h2><p><em>In “Naraka: Bladepoint”, “Blocklist” is used instead of “Blacklist” to refer to the blacklist.</em></p>

<h3 id="Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination"><a href="#Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination" class="headerlink" title="Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination"></a>Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination</h3><p>These two types of pitfalls do not appear frequently in the game. In the process of daily player contact or questionnaire design, we will use many words related to “people” and “identity”. By comparing the following, we can find that in the localization process, we should avoid describing people’s “aging” and “defectiveness”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/d9db7493-6954-4a0d-b650-0be1cff0e7b0.png"></p>
<h3 id="Gender-Sexual-Orientation-Discrimination"><a href="#Gender-Sexual-Orientation-Discrimination" class="headerlink" title="Gender&#x2F;Sexual Orientation Discrimination"></a>Gender&#x2F;Sexual Orientation Discrimination</h3><p>According to recent research, in 2021, about 45% of gamers are women. This means that when we use words, we need to pay special attention to “gender-neutral words”. Newzoo also pointed out that “the old stereotype that games are only for boys or men no longer exists”. </p>

It has provided players with a third (genderless) option during the character creation process.</em></h2><p>There are many mistakes that are easy to make in gendered words. Let’s take the word “Guys” as an example:</p>
<p>The word “guys” originally referred to the English historical figure Guy Fawkes, but in the mid-18th century to the 20th century, the word began to be used in the United States to refer to “men” in general. Because there was no suitable phrase to represent the plural form of “you”, the plural form of “guys” eventually evolved into a colloquial form used to refer to a group of people.</p>
<p>Today, the word does not always mean “plural of men”, but critics believe that the word is sexist because, although it claims to be neutral, it actually positions men as the “default”. For women in male-dominated industries, using “guys” to refer to the whole reinforces their sense of being a minority. The word is also problematic for gender non-conforming people, for whom “guys” may be a misrepresentation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/4fb2b984-ab17-40e6-b4f1-bf67d5c781ad.png"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”"><a href="#“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”" class="headerlink" title="“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”"></a><em>“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”</em></h2><p>Similarly, you should not call a group of women “girls” at work, as this is demeaning and offensive. Phrases that should not be used when talking to or about women: Girls, Bossy, Feisty, Ball bust, Shrill, Sweetie, honey-bun.</p>
<p>In the community, instead of “hey guys”, we are more encouraged to use “hey everyone”, “hey everybody” or the simpler “hey all”. Of course, some games have more unique names for their players, such as players of <em>For All Time</em> being called “使君大人” (Shǐ jūn dàrén), and players of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> being called “forerunners”, etc. These words will give players a more intimate and inclusive feeling.</p>
<h2 id="4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism"><a href="#4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism" class="headerlink" title="4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism"></a>4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism</h2><p>The relative flexibility of English allows us to successfully navigate these unsettling and exclusive terms and phrases and find alternatives. However, in other languages, this is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at an example from Lera’s Broditsky’s TED Talk: There are ten pictures of people to be arranged in order. The instruction is: “Arrange the pictures from the youngest-looking to the oldest-looking.”</p>
<p>People who speak European languages usually arrange them from left to right, but people who speak Mandarin may arrange them from top to bottom, while people who speak Hebrew or Arabic arrange them from right to left. These differences come from different languages’ perceptions and expressions of time, and the concepts and vocabulary that exist in certain languages. For people who speak the Australian indigenous language Kuuk Thaayorre, right and left do not exist, so if you ask them for directions, they will not tell you to go straight and turn right, but for example, go south and then west.</p>
<p>There are many similar differences. Some languages differ in how they divide the color spectrum, and the boundaries between colors are not universal. In English, we have the word blue, which includes any different shades of blue. However, in Ukrainian, there is no such word, because the language distinguishes between light blue and dark blue. Some other languages only have a few colors, such as “light” and “dark”. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-3"><a href="#nbsp-3" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/e4e796a6-4bd5-4cc4-96e5-2d25b11752d8.png"></h2><h2 id="Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”"><a href="#Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”" class="headerlink" title="Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”"></a><em>Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”</em></h2><p>Among the 6,900 languages in the world, more than 1&#x2F;4 of the languages make a distinction between genders. In addition to the differences in the use of color, left and right, etc. in different language environments mentioned above, in the process of multilingual localization, we can follow the following rules to use gender-related inclusive language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spanish:</strong> Use “@” or “X” to replace the letters that set the gender of words. Although not officially recognized, this has been a common usage in the past few years. But there is an inconvenience: these characters cannot be pronounced or read by text-to-speech applications, which will affect the dubbing of game audio and create obstacles for visually impaired people using such software.</li>
<li><strong>Italian:</strong> Using an asterisk (*) instead of –a (feminine) and –o (masculine) in words or using “@” for plural has become a common practice, especially online. However, this usage also has certain problems. If overused, the text will be full of asterisks, and symbols will appear every other word, causing reading difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>German:</strong> In German, the asterisk (<em>) can also be used to indicate that there are more variants besides the displayed variants. For example, “der</em>die Priester*in” represents all genders in the spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>French:</strong> In French, we are witnessing the reinvention of language. For example, creating gender-inclusive pronouns to merge known masculine and feminine forms into one (iel&#x2F;yel&#x2F;yelle&#x2F;ille&#x2F;ol), while creating new grammatical declensions for nouns and adjectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221101/4cf6e0e0-abb6-46ab-b083-2f0ca14d5352.png"></p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>With the large-scale increase in the number of global game players, games have penetrated into people’s daily lives. It is a concern for game manufacturers and even the entire game industry to allow every player to find a setting corresponding to themselves in the game, or to allow players of different attributes to feel equal, fair, and concerned in the game. Among them, the inclusive language of games is becoming increasingly important. We can use it to help build a fairer game world, so that the game can be suitable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, etc. At the same time, in the game localization process, we also need to take cultural differences into account, and adjust the content in combination with local culture, language habits, etc., so as to more accurately meet the needs of the target market.</p>
