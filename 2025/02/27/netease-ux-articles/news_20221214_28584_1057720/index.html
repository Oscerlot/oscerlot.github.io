<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do we love playing games? Because they provide us with the opportunity to satisfy our inner psychological needs. For MMORPG players, satisfying social needs is an important factor that drives them to the virtual world. In the joyful world of resolving grudges with a smile, we can choose to play completely different roles and interact with others. “Being yourself” or “no longer being yourself” are both choices. And the premise of “playing” is “personalization.” Fashion appearance is one of the most direct personalization systems in the game.</p>
<p>How players dress up their characters is also a part of self-expression in social interaction. Therefore, players’ needs for fashion appearances in the game may also reflect their expectations for the image presented by the characters they control in social interaction. So, in MMO games, what is the relationship between players’ choices of fashion appearances and players’ self-expression in the virtual world?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”"><a href="#1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”" class="headerlink" title="1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”"></a>1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”</h2><p>With the iteration of the overall quality of games, the character images in MMO games are becoming more and more refined and beautiful. Players also have more methods and channels to pursue beauty and individuality. For example, in <em>Revelation M</em>, players can customize the colors and patterns of certain fashions, presenting different styles with the same tailoring and design through their own thinking. Players can also trade in the store and earn income by selling their creations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>![](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/97b2e81d-dc33-488f-b057-f28ad9b9e020.png">https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/97b2e81d-dc33-488f-b057-f28ad9b9e020.png</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/b85982d2-cb08-4bac-bbc9-8e3826f32a12.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Revelation M’s Stylist System (top) and Player Styling Store (bottom)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In such a highly free customization system, some players have begun to pursue another extreme of aesthetics (as shown below). The left side is created by players through dyeing and printing on the basis of the clothing on the right side. Why do players pursue to emulate the “Shamate” (杀马特 - shā mǎ tè, a Chinese subculture known for its extravagant and often garish fashion) style, and even take photos and share them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/2bd33211-f437-4ca0-90c8-fed1d48ef591.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Player-customized Shamate style (left) and the corresponding original clothing (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Because the “Shamate” style does not mean that players lack aesthetics, but is a way for some players to pursue social recognition.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, personalization is an important prerequisite for social interaction. In <em>Revelation M</em>, where even NPCs are handsome men and beautiful women, “good-looking” does have a thousand faces. But when everyone is as beautiful as a banished immortal, the extreme <em>tuwei</em> (土味 - tǔ wèi, meaning “rustic” or “tacky”) is more eye-catching and more impressive. This kind of behavior is no different from the pursuit of “riding a server-limited mount and swaggering through the streets”. Both are self-expression in social interaction. The only difference is that the former tries to seek recognition by showing personality, because such a dress conveys the message “I am very interesting, I have a personality”.</p>
<p>In fact, after the aesthetic significance is greatly reduced, it is not difficult to see that such a dress is completely for social needs, and it may lose its meaning if it is not seen&#x2F;commented on by others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/62121856-dac6-4362-a0c0-e005e664a1e7.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Revelation M players in groups, all dressed in Shamate style</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is worth noting that there is a subtle difference between such personalized customization and what is called “not good-looking”. First, Shamate dress is often high-profile and direct. When customizing fashion in <em>Revelation M</em>, you can adjust the color temperature and hue to make the entire fashion emit fluorescence, announcing at the first time that “this dress is <em>tuwei</em>“. Second, others can see that the Shamate appearance is intentional by the player, and not really a lack of aesthetics. It can be seen that the two players dressed up in the picture above actually put a lot of effort into it. The male character in fluorescent yellow in the picture above needs to adjust the hue and color temperature of all the color blocks on the whole body to be uniform to achieve a harmonious <em>tuwei</em>; while the player on the far left, who dyed and printed each part of the clothing with reference to the “Northeast China floral袄” (dōng běi dà huā ǎo, a traditional Chinese jacket with a bold floral pattern), carefully chose suitable prints and adjusted their positions.</p>
<p>In contrast, players rarely choose appearances like the one below, where it is difficult to tell whether it is “intentional” or “just their aesthetic”, as a symbol of showing off their personality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/2b050c0a-b621-4865-a110-0381325f55c2.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”"><a href="#2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”" class="headerlink" title="2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”"></a>2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”</h2><p>Games are a virtual world, and players can choose to play a role that is completely different from themselves, even including gender. In MMO games, it is very common for the player’s gender to be inconsistent with the character’s gender. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/340486c3-3b21-474b-a63f-554e06bdc77e.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The character’s appearance, the player’s gender, and his custom tag</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Taking male players as an example, a typical dress for the female characters they control is a fair, youthful, and pure image. For example, in the figure below, the two dresses are from characters controlled by players of different genders. It is not difficult to see that the left picture is a character controlled by a male player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/4cb49cd6-f9ee-4594-b25c-9372d76054ef.png"></p>
<p>If you think about it carefully, the way male players meticulously dress up their characters seems to be no different from girls playing with Barbie dolls in terms of expression. This kind of behavior may be considered by some to be detrimental to traditional masculinity. Similarly, looking at female players, choosing a male character means giving up the exquisitely detailed dresses. Given the high opportunity cost and potential risks, why are players still enjoying choosing opposite-sex characters?</p>
<p>Because when the player’s gender is inconsistent with the character’s gender, the character image is no longer equivalent to the player’s social image in the game, but a projection of personal aesthetics. In other words, at this time, “I am no longer me”, and the player and the character have a subject-object relationship.</p>
<p>Taking the “Ni Su” (逆苏 - nì sū) culture, which has often been mentioned in recent years, as an example, Ni Su, that is, “reverse Mary Sue”, originally meant that in the fan circle, fans gave traditional female qualities to their favorite male artists through secondary creation of materials related to them, reconstructing the gender roles of themselves and the artists, and forming a new dominance relationship. For example, calling a male artist their “wife” is a typical “Ni Su”.</p>
<p>In MMORPGs, some female players also have similar behaviors when manipulating male characters. In their gaming habits, the male characters they manipulate are more like the image of the opposite sex they idealize, and they will dress them up according to their own aesthetics. But in game social interaction, no matter whether the character’s appearance is cold or noble, female players often have distinct personal characteristics. They have no intention of playing “a翩翩公子 (piān piān gōng zǐ, a handsome and elegant young man)”, but comfortably reveal their own personalities as social beings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/2810975e-888f-46fd-9f87-216ee0750737.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>A female player’s dress-up of her male character in Justice Online (Source: Weibo Justice Online Super Topic)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In this case, players have fixed expectations for the characters they manipulate, which contain the player’s own aesthetic preferences. The player’s main consideration is no longer the group’s aesthetic standards, but whether they like it and whether it exceeds their expectations.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”"><a href="#3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”"></a>3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”</h2><p>In the fashion stores of various MMO games, there is always a white fashion that sells very well. “Fairy”, “elegant” and “noble” seem to be eternal keywords. In the research, we found that when players evaluate the aesthetics of fashion, they pay more attention to the temperament shown behind the fashion. In today’s extreme pursuit of personalization, why do many female players have such similar preferences. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/517131d9-1b7b-4591-a65e-41d6e72481a5.png"></p>
<p>Because in the pursuit of white clothes, players also become more “beautiful” people, to ultimately gain public (social) recognition.</p>
<p>Many MMO themes in China are based on various martial arts&#x2F;xianxia masterpieces. Most MMO players are from the 80s&#x2F;90s generation and have been deeply influenced by martial arts writers such as Gu Long and Jin Yong. They have a similar understanding of the events of the <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, the martial arts world), for example, when it comes to the true, good and beautiful female image in the <em>jianghu</em>, there are the following descriptions:</p>
<p><em>“Her appearance is peerless, both beautiful as a fairy and bright and gorgeous, with skin like ice and bones like jade, as pure as a fairy from Gǔyè, with a natural and spiritual beauty; her martial arts are light and elegant, defeating enemies and winning in a graceful and charming way.” “She is upright and bright, broad-minded, and repays grievances with virtue.”</em></p>
<p>The above is Mr. Jin Yong’s description of Xiaolongnü in the original novel “The Return of the Condor Heroes”. In fact, if you read carefully, you will find that these two descriptions do not mention clothing and appearance, but the association given to people is a female image with white clothes and black hair like a waterfall. When the entire group has been influenced by a certain culture, individual aesthetic preferences may also be assimilated.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we have formed a connection between qualities such as “natural and spiritual beauty” and “bright and gorgeous” and concrete features (“white clothes” and “skirts”), because in too many film and television&#x2F;artistic images we have seen, white-clad swordsmen who uphold justice, that is, elegant women in white clothes, are more likely to be recognized by the public. Therefore, a white dress may also be more attractive in the eyes of others, thereby gaining the recognition of others. Of course, this process is not necessarily conscious, that is, players do not necessarily buy to seek recognition, but as a form of self-expression, gaining recognition is one of the influencing factors of personalization.</p>
<p>Does this phenomenon have scalability and practical significance?</p>
<p>In previous contacts with <em>Revelation M</em> players, we classified daily temperaments and confirmed their preferences through player choices. The actual sales of related fashions and players’ preferences for temperament confirmed and expanded the above conclusions: in addition to “fairy white clothes”, some “non-white clothes” appearance designs with “elegant”, “noble” and “classical” temperaments are also very popular with female players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/bd47b52e-80a7-4539-984a-d2fc5ea896ab.png"></p>
<p>In summary, fashions with elegant colors, flowing skirts, and exquisite and atmospheric fabrics are more likely to be favored by female players; at the same time, they need to outline the slender and beautiful limbs of female characters and show a graceful waist. Many players are disgusted with the bloated look (such as thick skirts and sleeves, fluffy fur collars and shawls).</p>
<h2 id="4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”"><a href="#4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”" class="headerlink" title="4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”"></a>4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”</h2><p>In male players’ choices of fashion, there are also such group characteristics. Their sensitivity to fashion details is relatively lower, but many male players have a common demand, that is, the characteristics of fashion cannot have a feminine or charming temperament (i.e., cannot be “effeminate”). Even as society becomes more and more tolerant of male aesthetics, this is still a major minefield in the design of game fashion appearances. Why can’t many male players accept clothes with this kind of temperament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/3b28df6f-712b-4954-9530-2cf1333d8f90.png"></p>
<p>Because while rejecting the “feminine” appearance, male players are also avoiding the possibility of a setback in social status, so as to maintain their dominant position in the group&#x2F;society.</p>
<p>In the traditional gender binary, men and women are given stereotypes in society that are not related to gender itself (“pink is for girls, blue is for boys”). More deeply, the social status of men has been higher than that of women for thousands of years in the past (“three cardinal guides and five constant virtues”). Traditional masculinity has gradually become equated with higher social status in practice. Conversely, having traditional female qualities means “being dominated” and “submissive”. Therefore, for some players, wearing pink fashion is so “disgusting” because it means that traditional male characteristics are dissolved, resulting in the loss of power and status, and they cannot be recognized as men.</p>
<p>In MMO games, when a male player manipulates a male character to wear clothes with traditional female qualities, he is likely to be ridiculed by men and even some women. This is detrimental to the social image, so many male players may consider avoiding such fashions to avoid image frustration.</p>
<p>As a positive example, the “breakout hit” appearance “Jing Hong Yu” (惊鸿羽 - jīng hóng yǔ, meaning “Graceful Feather”) previously launched by <em>Justice Online</em> also confirms this view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20221214/e3d09472-6c23-44fc-8720-f5dcfc1259bf.png"></p>
<p>Launched in 2020, this fashion was a breakthrough in the appearance design of <em>Justice Online</em> - exposing the chest and abdominal muscles of male characters; once launched, this fashion was a double harvest of popularity and sales. In fact, the design of Jing Hong Yu also has the characteristics of large-area exposure and bright colors. But why are its sales so high?</p>
<p>Because the freshness brought by the “design breakthrough” made the overall public opinion at that time tend to be positive, this fashion was considered to be “lined”, “domineering” and “sexy”, and even female players requested to buy it in public opinion. In this scenario, buying Jing Hong Yu does not damage the traditional masculinity, on the contrary, it is another emphasis on the ideal social image of male players. Therefore, male players of <em>Justice Online</em> have passionately placed orders for this fashion that “looks very domineering” and “is liked by young ladies”.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, appearance characteristics that may be considered by players to have traditional female qualities include: bright colors, exposed skin, soft makeup, etc. However, whether it is “effeminate” or not is a very subjective concept, which varies from player group to player group. For example, in the above-mentioned <em>Justice Online</em>, male fashions presented in a V-shape always fail to escape being described as “feminine”. But in <em>Revelation M</em>, players are more tolerant of this type of clothing design. But in any case, as long as the player feedback on a male fashion forms a clear negative public opinion about “wearing it is very effeminate”, the sales of this fashion are likely to decline.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article starts from the choice of fashion appearance by MMO player groups, and analyzes the situation where the choice of fashion is affected by social factors. After being given social significance, players will consider the social image they present in communication when choosing fashion appearances. For example, in order to pursue a higher evaluation, players often choose fashions with features that are generally recognized in the group, such as elegant and ethereal white clothes; to avoid potential risks, such as a setback in social status, male players will avoid choosing appearances with specific designs that may be considered to have a certain temperament.</p>
<p>User and player research will not be a combination of independent characteristics. As individuals, players’ needs, behaviors and habits affect each other on different levels. Understanding and explaining player behavior from different perspectives can help us build a more comprehensive understanding.</p>
