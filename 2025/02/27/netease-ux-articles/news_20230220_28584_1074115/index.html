<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>FPS (First-Person Shooter), as a globally popular game genre, is deeply loved by players for its realistic battlefield atmosphere and exciting competitive confrontation. Every player has their own preferences, and when we evaluate an FPS game, gun feel is always an unavoidable aspect.</p>
<p>So what is gun feel? As a comprehensive feeling, it is difficult to define. It is an objective existence. How many game developers have racked their brains for it: all the feedback during the use of the gun can be included in the gun feel. It is also a subjective feeling in people’s minds: the player’s preconceived cognitive expectation of the gun’s “rules”. Only when the two match and cooperate with each other can a good gun feel be created.</p>
<p>For example, general FPS players perceive the AK as having a larger spread and strong recoil. If the shooting feedback fails to express this level of information, the player will feel that the gun is “weak”. It is difficult to change the player’s cognitive expectations. It is necessary to cater to the player by designing good gun use feedback, and this is the essence of improving gun feel.</p>
<p>All feedback is part of gun feel, but many players will first pay attention to some obvious information, such as gun model accuracy, shooting animation, sound effects, special effects, etc., but they know little about the role of interaction design in it. But it is certain that good interaction design can increase the realism and feel of the gun, and it also needs to be valued and carefully considered.</p>
<h2 id="1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake"><a href="#1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake" class="headerlink" title="1. Recoil System and Screen Shake"></a>1. Recoil System and Screen Shake</h2><p>When it comes to gun feel, many people will give priority to the recoil system of the gun. After all, this is the visual information that best reflects the power of the gun. But what are the manifestations of the recoil system?</p>
<h3 id="Viewkick"><a href="#Viewkick" class="headerlink" title="Viewkick"></a>Viewkick</h3><p>This is the most familiar part for FPS players. It refers to the camera that is constantly raised with continuous shooting, which is普遍存在 (pǔ biàn cún zài - universally present) in all shooting games. The generally-called “recoil control” is to control the recoil of this part. This is a form of recoil expression that almost all FPS games have. In terms of design, it is generally adjusted according to the recoil value of the gun, whether it is scoped, whether it is holding breath, the gun holding action, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/3be7f91f-957d-48b8-a513-d1bb906744b3.gif"></p>
<h3 id="Gunkick"><a href="#Gunkick" class="headerlink" title="Gunkick"></a>Gunkick</h3><p>Gunkick refers to the phenomenon that the crosshair continuously deviates from the center of the camera during continuous shooting, and the exit point of the bullet is tied to the crosshair, causing the impact point of the bullet to change accordingly. Its core lies in the constantly changing trajectory driven by the muzzle shake, which makes the entire shooting process very accurate and real, and can bring an extremely excellent shooting experience, but its implementation cost is also the highest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/c4e2fe5b-4f10-463d-9e52-b259fa445606.gif"></p>
<h3 id="Visual-Recoil"><a href="#Visual-Recoil" class="headerlink" title="Visual Recoil"></a>Visual Recoil</h3><p>Visual recoil is similar to Gunkick, but different. It also refers to the crosshair deviating from the center of the camera, but it will return to the center of the screen before the next bullet is fired. It has no effect on the impact point of the bullet (which is always the center of the screen). It is just a visual expression. Simply put, Visual recoil is an animated version of muzzle jump and does not change the trajectory (and the fact is that Visual recoil is indeed a random play of multiple animations). It is enough for shooting games that pursue impact but not extreme accuracy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/3713ef6b-48bb-472b-b236-8177a21e69da.gif"></p>
<h3 id="Viewroll"><a href="#Viewroll" class="headerlink" title="Viewroll"></a>Viewroll</h3><p>Viewroll refers to the phenomenon of rotating around the center of the camera during shooting. It has no effect on the position of the crosshair and the camera, so it is just a visual effect to enhance recoil. Many FPS games in recent years have adopted it. From a design point of view, Viewkick reflects the vertical stability of the gun holder, then Viewroll reflects the horizontal stability. Therefore, the design ideas of these two are not much different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/cf678b8c-8185-4b86-b13a-9dff283cc083.gif"></p>
<h3 id="Spread"><a href="#Spread" class="headerlink" title="Spread"></a>Spread</h3><p>Spread refers to the phenomenon that bullets are randomly distributed on the diffusion circle with the aiming baseline A as the center. That is, aiming at one point, the bullet will not necessarily hit that point, but there will be an unavoidable deviation. It is achieved by directly modifying the code to displace the bullet by a small distance at a long distance. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the recoil performance system, but in design, it can be used as a supplement to Visual recoil to undertake the task of randomly distributing the trajectory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/88dc50e5-291c-475d-8543-637a8d4ac200.gif"></p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>Viewkick and Gunkick are the performance of recoil on the aiming baseline, which actually affects the player’s aiming; Spread is to directly modify the position of the bullet to achieve the “offset” feeling in the recoil system; Visual recoil and Viewroll are just visual expressions and have no factual impact on the player’s aiming and shooting (but may still form visual misleading).</p>
<p>Perhaps after talking about the above points, many readers are still confused about the interactive performance of the recoil system. Next, we will use game comparisons to illustrate how the recoil system affects the gun feel from the player’s interactive experience.</p>
<p>First, a horizontal comparison between <em>Battlefield 1</em> and <em>Battlefield V</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/60395801-84d4-435d-b444-a63dade1d9aa.gif"></p>
<p>Comparing the above two animated pictures, which gun do you think has a stronger sense of power?</p>
<p>Many readers will choose <em>Battlefield 1</em> on the right. The reason is that as works of the Battlefield series, the bullet exit points of both are tied to the center of the screen, but because <em>Battlefield 1</em> has Visual recoil, which <em>Battlefield V</em> does not have, its crosshair can move additionally away from the center of the screen, and it has a stronger sense of power in the performance layer of recoil. At the same time, <em>Battlefield 1</em> also has a larger Spread, which enhances the thrill of strafing.</p>
<p>The above two points give <em>Battlefield 1</em> a better shooting experience, but also produced a problem that has been criticized by players, that is, the crosshair of <em>Battlefield 1</em> is deceptive. Aiming but not hitting is the main source of frustration in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. Therefore, DICE studio canceled these two points in the development of <em>Battlefield V</em> in exchange for a “point and shoot” PVP kill experience, and at the same time adopted a larger Viewkick to make up for the shortcomings in the shooting experience.</p>
<p>The above comparison tells us that performance (gun feel) and operation (shooting accuracy) are difficult to balance, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> series (hereinafter referred to as COD) gives a better solution to this problem, that is, Gunkick. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/f0c07ea2-76f9-4c71-bd9a-efd3364be5c7.gif"></p>
<p>First of all, COD also has the offset between the crosshair and the center of the screen, but unlike the Visual recoil of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the bullet exit point of COD is tied to the crosshair, that is, Gunkick. This offset will not mislead the player’s aiming, because the player’s reference point when making fine-tuning aiming is always the crosshair. In addition, Gunkick can also replace the random effect of Spread’s trajectory, and there will be no problem of erratic trajectory like Spread, which can be described as the best of both worlds. Of course, the disadvantage of Gunkick is that it is difficult to balance cost and performance. Only FPS game industry ceilings like COD can better control it.</p>
<h2 id="2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design"><a href="#2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Crosshair and Sight Design"></a>2. Crosshair and Sight Design</h2><p>I believe that players of any FPS game will find a strange phenomenon, that is, when we watch games or live broadcasts, we always find that some players or anchors set the crosshair to some strange shapes. After logging in to the game, I also tried the same, but found that other people’s settings were not as good as my own, and the default crosshair felt better. What is going on? In fact, the design of the crosshair and the sight also includes the careful consideration of the interaction designer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/7deaa0d6-5fea-4f3d-8416-1d73c22e5da2.png"></p>
<h3 id="Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental"><a href="#Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental" class="headerlink" title="Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental"></a>Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental</h3><p>The form of the UI is closely related to its function. To answer this question, we must first return to the original design purpose and function of the crosshair - to assist players in aiming at the enemy. A simple sentence can actually be divided into two steps: First, find the position of your own crosshair and the enemy, and move the crosshair to the enemy; second, fine-tune the crosshair to aim at a certain part of the enemy (such as the head) and shoot. Although many FPS veterans are already proficient in shooting and are not aware of the process, they still cannot do without these two steps.</p>
<p>From this, it can be found that the crosshair that contains the larger area is easier to achieve the first step; and the smaller and more precise the crosshair, the easier it is to achieve the second step. This is also the reason why some professional players like to shrink the crosshair: for them, the first step no longer needs any guidance, what they need is to aim at the enemy’s weakness more accurately. In fact, the default crosshair of <em>CS: GO</em> takes into account the above two steps: the small point in the middle is used for precise aiming; the cross around it is used to expand the overall area for rough aiming. Therefore, most players do not need to adjust the default crosshair, and the interaction designer has already considered it thoroughly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/73ada4c3-75fb-4245-b6a8-4503bb3d11cb.png"></p>
<h3 id="Form-Follows-Function"><a href="#Form-Follows-Function" class="headerlink" title="Form Follows Function"></a>Form Follows Function</h3><p>In recent years, with the development of FPS game design and technology, some strange crosshair styles have appeared in the player’s field of vision, but in the final analysis, it is still form follows function.</p>
<p>The crosshair has been around for the longest time. It contains a horizontal headshot line and is widely used in weapons that require precise shooting and pre-aiming; the circular crosshair is suitable for suppression. It clearly indicates the scattering range and is used in melee combat, with AOE damage, and guns that do not require precision; there are also crosshairs with parabolic scales, which are obviously used in some weapons with obvious bullet drop, such as bows and arrows, grenade launchers, etc. These crosshair styles are the most authentic feedback of the weapon, and some even borrowed from the sight of the weapon in reality. They deeply affect the first impression of a gun and also affect the player’s feeling of gun feel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/525528be-d8f2-4090-9f4e-970095378dd1.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-Hit-Feedback"><a href="#3-Hit-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="3. Hit Feedback"></a>3. Hit Feedback</h2><p>As the last step of the player’s interaction with the gun, the existence of hit feedback is a great positive incentive. The enemy’s hit action, particle effects, sound effects and other multi-sensory forms of expression constitute the current mainstream FPS hit feedback.</p>
<p>But due to the limitations of many competitive games, for example, in fast-paced games like <em>Overwatch</em>, it is impossible to show the enemy’s hit animation separately for the player, and the hit special effects are also greatly reduced; in <em>CS: GO</em>, in order to ensure the fairness of the competition, animation and special effects are also simplified as much as possible. At this time, interaction designers need to take action to provide certain hit feedback on the UI.</p>
<h3 id="Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross"><a href="#Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross" class="headerlink" title="Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross"></a>Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross</h3><p>In the hit feedback on the UI, most of them are currently attached to the crosshair: when hitting the enemy, an “x” cross will appear on the crosshair, and different variants will present different information. These variants are the focus of the design.</p>
<p>The COD series uses a set of cognitive habits that players have formed for design: when your shot hits the enemy, a white “x” cross appears around the crosshair; if this hit is a kill, the “x” cross appears red; when you attack continuously, the animation of the “x” cross is flashing. Most games on the market currently use this set of UI hit feedback design. Although it is traditional, it is stable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/94824c4a-1953-4847-b829-c02881a7c1bd.gif"></p>
<p><em>Overwatch</em> has made certain innovations: the white “x” cross still indicates a hit, and the red “x” cross is changed to a hit on a weak point, so it is necessary to design another icon to indicate a kill. Overwatch chose the most intuitive red skull. At the same time, Overwatch has also improved the animation performance of the “x” cross under continuous attack, from monotonous “flashing” to increasing the side length of the “x” cross to express the accumulation of damage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20230220/4b9bf058-8d3f-403c-87f0-828c378ae454.gif"></p>
<p>What’s more, such as <em>Biomutant</em>, the hit feedback is directly mounted on the enemy instead of the UI, which makes the hit feedback out of the scope of the UI interface, but more like a stylized special effect. But compared with the former with a fixed position, mounting the hit feedback on the enemy can better reflect the flexibility of the battle and has a better performance in PVE.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Gun feel, as the soul of FPS, is something that every game company must carefully consider and design when making this type of game. A good shooting feel can greatly enhance the coherence and interactivity of the game process and lay the foundation for a good player experience. This is a complex and arduous project. Although interaction only accounts for a small proportion of it, its role should not be underestimated. Whether it is recoil performance, crosshair, or hit feedback, it is what players pay attention to and value. It is believed that with the development of FPS games, more interaction designers will invest in these fields of work and propose more solutions for better gun feel.</p>
