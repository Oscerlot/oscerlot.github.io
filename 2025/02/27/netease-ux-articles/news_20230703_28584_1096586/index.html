<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the early days of video game development, audio experiences were often added to the game in the later stages of development, and were unlikely to fully meet the needs of game type, emotional content, background, etc. Today, in game development, it is often necessary to consider dimensions such as cost and player needs, but content consumption is always naturally faster than production, and game music still faces the problem of insufficient supply.</p>
<p>Game soundtracks themselves need to be adapted to the game’s level, map, and scene design. This high dependence on basic game design can lead to a problem: if the game itself does not adopt a highly differentiated and personalized design in terms of maps, scenes, characters, etc., even if the game soundtrack composers have tried to make as many changes as possible in the number of tracks and music structure design, it is still impossible to solve the problem of obvious homogeneity.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because if players stay on a specific map for a long time without exploring other maps, or if the overall map elements and general style of the game are relatively consistent, and unlike fantasy games that can accommodate many imaginative designs, what players hear is always music that is generally consistent in style. Even if there are subtle stylistic differences between different pieces of music, whether or not these differences can be heard depends largely on the player’s own level of musical aesthetic.</p>
<p>Therefore, game music often still faces the problem of high repetition, and even makes players bored and disgusted, directly muting the game.</p>
<p>So how can we explore potential solutions to this problem? This article will break down the problem from the aspects of players’ needs for music differentiation, factors affecting music perception, and music content customization, and discuss how to alleviate the problem of music repetition.</p>
<h2 id="1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation"><a href="#1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation" class="headerlink" title="1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation"></a>1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation</h2><p>Before starting the discussion, let’s briefly introduce the categories of various game music as an introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambient music</strong> (including large maps, dungeons, etc.): battle music, map music</li>
<li><strong>Functional music</strong> (instrumental performance, objects containing short musical snippets in the game, victory&#x2F;defeat music)</li>
<li><strong>Story music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cutscene music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Songs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, why do players need differentiated game music?</p>
<p>This needs to be analyzed from two levels: experience and function. From an experiential perspective, game music plays a role in creating an atmosphere, such as promoting the development of the plot climax and stimulating the player’s sense of tension in battle; in terms of functionality, game music can play a role in prompting information, such as customizing music according to the characteristics of the map, players can hear the national culture of a map from the music style, or the battle music will usually become more and more intense, thereby indicating the increase in the difficulty of the level. These are all components of immersion.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the game music is not differentiated, players will lack an auditory channel to grasp the information of the game, and will lose a certain degree of emotional investment, thus appearing to lack immersion. </p>

<h2 id="2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music"><a href="#2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?"></a>2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?</h2><p>After understanding that players have certain needs for music differentiation, what kind of music can highlight differentiation in the perception of players? We can first look at what factors will affect players’ perception of game music.</p>
<h3 id="The-Existence-of-Music"><a href="#The-Existence-of-Music" class="headerlink" title="The Existence of Music"></a>The Existence of Music</h3><p>Past psychological studies have found that the existence of music is self-evident for the creation of immersion and emotional connection in video games. However, in this regard, the existing research results present two extremes.</p>
<p>For some players, when the music is turned off, their emotions are detached from the game, and they believe that music is crucial for masking external noise and interference. But conversely, some people have suggested that if there is no music, they can better focus on the game experience, because music is a part of the game that players cannot actually control, which will make them feel less in control. This may be because when the music is turned off, players are more likely to hear other operation-related sound effects without being distracted by the music, so that they can be more immersed in the game.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music"><a href="#Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music"></a>Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music</h3><p>Generally speaking, players tend to choose familiar songs to get the emotions or emotional effects they want to enhance immersion. But in fact, the player’s prediction here is not necessarily correct. Because players lack experience in understanding the complex interaction between music and games, they may not be able to correctly choose the music they think can help achieve the desired effect. For example, when choosing battle music, players may tend to choose repetitive short songs, but in fact, repetitive short songs are easy to distract people, and they will make the atmosphere too tense, and even hinder the play of skills and battle strategies.</p>
<h3 id="Lyrics"><a href="#Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="Lyrics"></a>Lyrics</h3><p>Lyrics have the risk of distracting players, especially if players like the song, they will be immersed in the lyrics rather than the game. This is because players cannot ignore the familiar lyrics in the song when playing the game, and may even hum along. In addition, they will intentionally or unintentionally try to associate the lyrics with the game, which may be because most people are accustomed to watching visual effects that match the lyrics of the song, thereby establishing a connection between the visual effects and the lyrics. </p>

<h3 id="Differences-in-Music-Genres"><a href="#Differences-in-Music-Genres" class="headerlink" title="Differences in Music Genres"></a>Differences in Music Genres</h3><p>In addition, music types can also affect the gaming experience. Music that does not match the atmosphere of the corresponding scene will often increase the player’s anxiety and lead to a lack of concentration. Among them, certain music genres are more suitable for specific types of gameplay, which is also related to the historical development of the cultural connotation of music genres.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design"><a href="#Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Expectations for Music Design"></a>Players’ Expectations for Music Design</h3><p>Soundtrack design is adjusted by several game parameters during runtime, such as switching according to the player’s game progress, etc. Experienced gamers are usually aware of the important role of music in reminding them of danger or providing other game information. Therefore, they will expect music to play a role in prompting battle status, actions, etc., and when this expectation is met, they will have a higher sense of immersion, otherwise they will be aware of the lack of this information and affect the overall game experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization"><a href="#3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization" class="headerlink" title="3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization"></a>3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization</h2><p>Returning to the countermeasures for the problem of music repetition, one solution is to adopt a music content customization model. There are also many ways to customize music content, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Online improvisation:</strong> In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can improvise on the musical instruments in the game. This interactive mode adds more fun and more different possibilities to the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fdbad9544-36a1-497c-a19d-046510d6583d.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Player-composed music:</strong> The musician in <em>Revelation M</em> allows players to customize music scores to play. This model can not only satisfy players’ creative desires, but also generate music autonomously through a large player base, enriching the game’s music content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F3a4751ba-131a-4ae5-a138-da528b873130.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>In-game custom album series:</strong> <em>GTA</em> allows players to customize in-car music, so that players can not only choose the songs they want to listen to in the game, but also upload their own playlists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fb7c21e61-66d9-4790-bea4-733d87456af9.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, some game companies are open to mod creation and source code release, with the aim of encouraging players to edit and share new levels or content based on the game. In order to be able to add audio to the new levels created, some players will develop mod tools and share them with other players to help them automatically write music and sound effects. For example, AudioMod in <em>Minecraft</em> allows users to add new music and sound effects to the game.</p>
<p>When Microsoft launched their Xbox 360 console in 2005, they also mandated that all games made for the Xbox 360 must allow players to customize the soundtrack, that is, when players plug in other MP3 players, the game music will be turned off and replaced by the player’s own music.</p>
<h2 id="4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game"><a href="#4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game"></a>4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game</h2><p>Why can the method of music content customization solve the problem of game music homogeneity to a certain extent?</p>
<p>First, players will subconsciously and autonomously establish a connection between music and the game. No matter what happens between the current auditory and visual environment, players will connect all the presented information together to realize their in-game experience.</p>
<p>Behind this phenomenon, it is not only because music will affect the player’s perception of images, but images will also affect the perception of music. Choosing and listening to music is not regarded as a peripheral experience of gameplay. On the contrary, even music external to the game and chosen by the player will be regarded as part of the game experience. It is not only used to mask background noise or provide additional entertainment, but also to enhance the emotions generated during the game.</p>
<p>This highlights the importance of games as Gesamtkunstwerk (total art, that is, all arts are combined under a unified ideology): the game experience is not only visual effects, gameplay, or sound, but the combination of these elements to create a better experience for players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fbc4bff3c-b33c-41dc-8fca-0bd4aeefb584.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, the player’s sense of control over the game is also key. Music content customization allows them to have better control over the game environment, and this control over music content also changes their relationship with game music. Player research found that when they can choose the music they want, their state anxiety level (“state anxiety” refers to a temporary state of anxiety, rather than a longer-term personality trait), heart rate&#x2F;skin electrical response will decrease, indicating a lower level of emotional arousal. This effect is especially obvious in players who are less familiar with the game or the corresponding music.</p>
<p>But in the game, should players really be kept at a low level of anxiety? The answer is no, because the sufficient sense of anxiety provided by music can also drive players to continue to move forward in the game. For those players who pursue a more exciting sense of battle, they will prefer to experience songs that can increase anxiety. In addition, players generally expect a more dynamic emotional range when playing games, and the variability and adaptability of music play an important role in enhancing this emotional range. Therefore, the actual music design also needs to refer to the emotional experience process of players’ games and consider more.</p>
<p>In short, game music design needs to consider both players’ conscious tendencies and players’ unconscious cognitive habits. Only by combining the two can we design a soundtrack that matches the player’s game emotional process.</p>
