<h2 id="1-Context"><a href="#1-Context" class="headerlink" title="1. Context"></a>1. Context</h2><h3 id="What-is-context"><a href="#What-is-context" class="headerlink" title="What is context?"></a>What is context?</h3><p>Context refers to the environment when using language. Context can usually be divided into two types: narrow and broad. Narrowly defined, it refers to the linguistic environment formed by the context of written language or the preceding and following words of spoken language; broadly defined, it refers to the specific environment of language expression (which can refer to specific occasions or social environment).</p>
<p>In addition to the objective environment, context is also related to the background knowledge in the minds of each user and expresser.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-recontextualization"><a href="#What-is-recontextualization" class="headerlink" title="What is recontextualization?"></a>What is recontextualization?</h3><p>“Recontextualization” is a sociolinguistic concept summarized by Per Linell, which refers to extracting a piece of discourse from its original context and placing it in a new context, and this new context may change the meaning and understanding of the discourse. This method is often used in various media and contexts such as news reports, political discourse, and advertising. In the words of the German poet Novalis, the role of recontextualization is to “make the familiar strange and the strange familiar”.</p>
<p>For example, “killing the chicken to get the eggs” originally meant killing the chicken in order to get the eggs; it is a metaphor for coveting immediate benefits without considering long-term interests. In “Let the Bullets Fly”, the “killing the chicken to get the eggs” in Master Huang’s context refers to getting rid of Zhang Mazi and taking back the diamonds.</p>
<p>For another example, the “original display” we see when visiting a museum is a “recontextualization” of the excavated&#x2F;preserved cultural relics: giving new value to the cultural relics in a new time and space. Visitors re-experience the era background of the cultural relics and their possible functions and meanings through the museum’s layout and curation. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Context"><a href="#Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Design Context"></a>Design Context</h3><p>The design context refers to the environment, background, and cultural factors of the design work, as well as the interaction between the design work and the surrounding environment, users, and society. The design context determines the actual effect and meaning of the design work.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly used household chopstick holder is designed with many openings for ventilation to prevent the chopsticks from being closed, damp, and deteriorating. This design in the outdoor context allows it to be used as a firewood stove. The porous structure cleverly ensures sufficient oxygen conditions for starting a fire. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/c3f38481-4b60-420e-88d3-6466e44d109b.gif"></p>

<h3 id="Game-Experience-Design-Context"><a href="#Game-Experience-Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Game Experience Design Context"></a>Game Experience Design Context</h3><p>The game’s worldview is a complex that encompasses architecture, space, scenes, art style, economy, system, and social customs. It encompasses the physical environment, cultural environment, and social environment in the design context, affecting the visual effects, cultural meanings, and values of the design content.</p>
<p>The interaction between the game and the player means that the game and the player are symbionts under the same worldview. Factors such as the player’s game goals and needs, usage habits, operating behaviors, and psychological state during use are as important as the worldview in affecting the use effect and user satisfaction of the design content. For example, in “Minecraft”, the large amount of real-world UGC content created by players continues to inject new vitality into the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/309d8dfb-9f23-4c82-a6f1-db3de71aa1f2.gif"></p>

<p>Therefore, in game experience design, considering the context is very important, it can help developers better understand the usage scenarios and needs of functions, so as to better meet user needs and improve player satisfaction. At the same time, considering the context can also help developers create design works with more cultural connotations and social value, and improve the artistry and innovation of design works.</p>
<h2 id="2-Recontextualization-in-Games"><a href="#2-Recontextualization-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Recontextualization in Games"></a>2. Recontextualization in Games</h2><p>Recontextualization in games refers to the game introducing new mechanisms or informing new information, so that players can (voluntarily) experience existing content in a new way, that is, a way to revitalize existing content. Common application methods in games include the following two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing familiar environments and content by using new mechanisms or props.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing existing content from different angles&#x2F;paths through the transfer of prior knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent example of recontextualization in game design is <em>Hitman 2</em>, where developers, through the design of “identity roles” and their “scope of activities” and “mission objectives”, allow players to have multiple “recontextualization” experiences, and even bring a “lingering” game experience.</p>
<p>In this game, players can eliminate NPCs of different class identities and clothing to disguise themselves as characters with different identity permissions, and then enter different areas of the map with different open levels. The single game map and the number of NPCs are fixed. In order to complete various challenges on the same map, players need to repeatedly explore and replay between different roles and areas using existing knowledge to achieve all challenge goals. At the same time, with the different identity roles of the player, the tasks that the current role needs to complete, the dangers in the scene, and the boundary prompts will also change. </p>

How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design"></a>3. How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design</h2><p>From a macro perspective, the game itself is a way to “recontextualize” the content it carries. Overall, there is only one core idea: “As long as I want to do it and I can do it, then I can do it”. But how to let players achieve this excellent experience of “thinking what I think, doing what I can” in experience design?</p>
<p>In the following content, we combine the experience design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Penglai Island Cloud Top Race to further explain how to use the design idea of recontextualization in the game:</p>
<p>Penglai Island is a three-dimensional social environment launched by <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in its 2nd anniversary version, and Cloud Top Race is a section of architectural and stone ruins located in the southern part of Silver阙 Garden. Players can enter this area from the south of Silver阙 Garden. When players pass through this area within 360 seconds and reach the race finish line on the west side of Secret Source Island, they can get certain race rewards. </p>

<h3 id="Broaden-the-Scope-and-Boundaries-of-Experience"><a href="#Broaden-the-Scope-and-Boundaries-of-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Broaden the Scope and Boundaries of Experience"></a>Broaden the Scope and Boundaries of Experience</h3><p>When designing a certain gameplay or function, in addition to listing all control states and sorting out the process, it is also necessary to consider all the operating processes of the player before, during, and after use. If possible, without interfering with other content and enriching the function, multiple entry or exit experience paths can be set for the same content to meet most of the possibilities of player exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/64b490a4-b51c-49de-8210-34e216bf5ebe.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Cloud Top Race game rules</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When designing the Cloud Top Race function of Penglai Island, it was not stipulated how players would reach the finish line, or what tools they would use. Only the most commonly used fast displacement prop in the game, [Grappling Hook], was triggered to increase the time. This can be regarded as a method reminder for reaching the finish line. In the actual experience process, players can follow the game’s teaching of jumping, grappling hook, wall strike, or even various combinations to reach the finish line in the fastest way, and they are all allowed.</p>
<h3 id="Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality"><a href="#Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Find Experience Mappings in Reality"></a>Find Experience Mappings in Reality</h3><p>In addition to simulating various behaviors that players may have, it is also necessary to further consider the source of gameplay and functions. Whether there are similar experience contents in reality. Sort out the experience processes of the two and correspond them one by one, reduce the keyboard and mouse interaction links in the design, and make the entire experience process more natural.</p>
<p>When designing the interaction between the start and finish lines of Cloud Top Race, the design team did not use the common general mechanism interaction in the game (ie, press [E]), but made a regional interaction behavior trigger logic, which can be very clearly found on it analogous to the experience process of most sports competitions in reality: players can start racing from entering the game area, start timing after crossing the “start line”, and stop timing and get rewards when reaching the finish line “crossing the line”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/4147d0e3-3027-4222-a983-40fb3bee9903.png"></p>

<h3 id="Optimize-the-Low-Emotional-Feedback-Content-in-the-Experience"><a href="#Optimize-the-Low-Emotional-Feedback-Content-in-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Optimize the Low Emotional Feedback Content in the Experience"></a>Optimize the Low Emotional Feedback Content in the Experience</h3><p>Although the above process mentions that it is necessary to analogy the “known” experience of players in reality to design the process of gameplay&#x2F;functions, it is also necessary to pay attention to continuously providing players with positive feedback during this process. That is, on the premise of ensuring the fairness of the game content, adjust the low emotional feedback nodes in the real experience, avoid excessive frustration, and keep the player’s emotions on the basic emotional baseline of the game during the experience.</p>
<p>In the race, the player’s use of the grappling hook prop itself can be regarded as a way to quickly move and reduce the fair racing experience, but the designer did not impose an “irreversible penalty” on the player, such as canceling the result in sports competitions, but used the analogy between movement distance and grappling hook, and used increasing timing to complete the basic punishment method for the player. Moreover, in many players’ racing processes, using the grappling hook when accidentally making a mistake in the middle of the race can also be used as an effective strategy to “avoid restarting”. Many skilled players can complete the entire race within 50 seconds even with a single use of the grappling hook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/ab7f5eb6-dab4-4f76-83ae-460e0f6bec6c.png"></p>

<p><em>Comparison of grappling hook time increase mechanism and foul knee bending score penalty mechanism</em></p>

<p>At the same time, in order to avoid the player’s emotional depression during the race, the target point prompt will be refreshed in time within a certain range during the race to help the player find the official racing track direction and avoid the player’s emotional low tide caused by direction loss; basic reward props are set for players with different racing durations to ensure the basic acquisition experience of players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/3ebdd198-99f7-454c-a150-4b12e36f2952.png"></p>

<p>After familiarizing yourself with “recontextualization” and this design idea, we can see that in addition to the large gameplay that can perfectly fit its design process, many small design details in the game also hide the ingenuity of “recontextualization”. For example, in the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> maps of Griffin’s Nest and Fire Nation, a large number of small animals that conform to the characteristics of the scene and season can obtain prop rewards after being killed, and shooting down the Spring Festival targets flying in the air will also drop different rewards. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Considerations"><a href="#Design-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Design Considerations"></a>Design Considerations</h3><p>The application of “recontextualization” in experience design can be regarded as a design method that can move the game four or two: it can expand the scope and possibilities of the game to infinity through limited content. However, due to the limitations of recontextualization design, this effect will only have a significant positive feedback effect in “non-linear” or “multi-map” games (that is, players do not need to complete the single-process game content according to a single timeline), such as the association design of A-side and B-side in Celeste, allowing players to enter the original level multiple times to experience new content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://nie.res.netease.com/r/pic/20231030/c5ed75e1-ac6f-47cf-bd7a-97e9278ecb69.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Celeste》 The player accidentally learned the charged super jump in the A-side content</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the same time, these “recontextualized” contents basically use more complex scene design and level connections in order to “create enough possibilities”, and often require more cost and time to develop. Some content details may not be discovered by players until the game disappears from the market.</p>
<p>As <em>The Stanley Parable</em> developer Pugh said, “The production of these contents is like shouting at the void. It may take two years before you can hear the echo from the other end of the void, because someone finally heard your silent shout from the cacophony.” However, it is precisely because these game designers continue to scrutinize and sculpt works of art that we can glimpse their state of mind at that time across time and space during the experience, and complete a spiritual adventure. </p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When we were children, we ran around downstairs at home, which constituted our first impression of the outside road. But when you learn to ride a bicycle, skateboard, or even drive, roads of different materials and widths have unique meanings in your eyes. From the first time you play games with a keyboard and mouse to later contacting different platforms and devices, the same game also produces new experiences in your eyes.</p>
<p>The powerful positive feedback brought by recontextualization design is essentially based on the player’s desire for learning and exploration and discovery, and the source of its happiness is the player’s original intention of being curious about the world. Please stay curious and continue to explore this world. Perhaps behind many of the contents you find with surprise, there is a carnival in the heart of a designer.</p>
