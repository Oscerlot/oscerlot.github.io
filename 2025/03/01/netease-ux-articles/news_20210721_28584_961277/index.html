<h3 id="What-is-GDC"><a href="#What-is-GDC" class="headerlink" title="What is GDC?"></a>What is GDC?</h3><p>GDC (Game Developers Conference) is the world’s most influential game developer conference, held annually in San Francisco, and has a history of 35 years. Although tickets for the week-long conference cost up to $2,000, as many as 27,000 industry professionals attend in person, demonstrating its value and authority. The highlight of GDC is the non-sponsored keynote speeches. Each year, the organizers invite less than 300 presentations on average, divided into two categories: Core and Summit. These speakers are carefully selected and invited by the organizers and their global advisory committee. They are highly recognized by the industry for their high quality and innovation, and to some extent represent the current highest level and development trend of the game industry.</p>
<p>Since 2020, due to COVID-19, it has been changed to an online format. The 2021 GDC conference was held from July 19th to 23rd.</p>
<hr>
<p>A presentation titled “Queuing: Let Data Guide Your Server Opening Strategy” was selected for this year’s GDC Online Game Technology Summit. This is the second time that NetEase Games Leihuo UX User Experience Center’s data mining team has been selected since its first participation in GDC in 2020. The presentation mainly discusses how to analyze the queuing mechanism from the perspective of game big data to assist games in flexibly adjusting server opening strategies and their application technologies. Two flexible server opening strategies are proposed in the presentation: “diversion” and “redirection”. The former avoids the risk of high server load by real-time monitoring and calculation of game queues and server logs, and opens servers in time to divert queues. The latter strategy is suitable for planned operational activity plans, combining player game portraits and players’ autonomous choices to direct players to designated servers in the plan, thereby bringing a better gaming experience.</p>
<p>The speaker is Sure from the data mining team of NetEase Games Leihuo UX User Experience Center. Today, Leihuo UX official website will give you an introduction.</p>
<p>As a senior data mining engineer, he joined the Leihuo UX data mining team as an intern in 2017 during his graduate studies at Zhejiang University, and took on the data mining work for the third test of <em>Justice</em>. His love for games and excellent data mining skills enabled him to grow rapidly during his internship and join the Leihuo UX data team. The first game he was independently responsible for data mining as a full-time employee was <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em>. During the launch period of the game’s national server, with his data mining foundation, he took the initiative to undertake the game’s full-process data mining work, and helped the game launch smoothly. He then took on the data work for the game’s overseas version throughout its entire life cycle. Half a year later, he began to follow up on the PC version of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, during which he greatly optimized the PC game’s log processing process and established PC game log specifications, further ensuring data quality. The PC and mobile game work experience accumulated during his work was summarized into processes and specifications and widely used within the team.</p>
<p>Following the growth and expansion of Leihuo and the Leihuo UX team, in early 2019, he began to serve as one of the leaders of the data mining team, leading team members to be responsible for more game product data services, including <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em>, <em>Hyper Scape</em>, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, <em>UNO!</em>, <em>Revelation Online</em>, <em>MARVEL Duel</em>, and more. “Data creates more game value” has always been the team’s goal. With the team’s unremitting efforts, the test and launch data work of game products has been successfully completed time and time again, and the player’s game experience has been continuously improved, helping game products achieve success.</p>

<h2 id="Game-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Game-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Game: Naraka: Bladepoint"></a><em>Game: Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><p>In addition to providing high-quality and agile basic data work, as the leader of the data mining team, he began to think about and upgrade existing businesses and expand new businesses. At the end of 2019, he participated in and led the data-side development of the new Tianyan BI data platform, which was officially launched. The platform launched a general BI module, integrated general logic, greatly reduced the development manpower of key indicators, provided richer visualization controls, and brought a standard data BI development model, which was well received by product owners after launch. Subsequently, he led the team to develop Leihuo UX’s self-developed recommendation system in stages, successively launching an AB test platform and algorithm services, which were applied to <em>UNO!</em>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year, he was successfully promoted to Data Mining Supervisor, and he is also one of the youngest supervisors to be promoted in NetEase in the same period. Let us look forward to his more achievements in the field of data mining and more active presence on the GDC stage!</p>
