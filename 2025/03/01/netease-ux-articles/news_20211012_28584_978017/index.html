<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211012/28584_978017.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1999 International Varsity Debate final, the University of Malaya and Xi’an Jiaotong University brought a wonderful battle of wits to debate enthusiasts. Relying on “solid argumentation, quick thinking, and beautiful imagery”, the four swordsmen of Xi’an Jiaotong University were invincible, easily winning the national debate, and the topic of “Is beauty objective or subjective” also triggered reflection.</p>
<p>But let’s be a little more down-to-earth, take “beauty” down from the crown of philosophy, and put it in the more approachable game, will the conclusion change? This is also a question that many game products are concerned about: what kind of characters and appearances will be favored by players?</p>
<h2 id="There-is-no-harm-without-comparison"><a href="#There-is-no-harm-without-comparison" class="headerlink" title="There is no harm without comparison"></a>There is no harm without comparison</h2><p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, female character appearances are more popular than male character appearances. Kurumi, with her rambling voice pack, is already half-way out of the circle. The phrase “Can you come and help Kurumi?” has penetrated deeply into the hearts of players. However, the popularity of female character appearances is not only related to the design of female characters, but more importantly, people’s aesthetics of men have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F47b5c848-852d-424f-9bbe-6b5dc287a088.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;47b5c848-852d-424f-9bbe-6b5dc287a088.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1: Male and female characters in Justice Online</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We may wish to list some of the characters of martial arts MMORPGs, it is not difficult to find that all the male characters in the game have long been out of the traditional martial arts image of the strong man, and move towards the direction of the celestial being. Just like the popular animated film Ne Zha, the image of the dragon prince is exactly like this (including Ne Zha after transformation). If the dragon prince is replaced by an image with a more martial arts flavor like Li Kui or Lu Zhishen, it is estimated that no one will ship them anymore.</p>
<p>As for the female image, foreign game manufacturers have begun to try to make a lot of changes. For example, Rob Gallerani, the game design director of the recent Diablo II: Resurrected, also said that the female Amazon warrior will be greatly modified in the remake. The new Amazon warrior looks stronger and more sturdy. The reason for this design is to make the Amazon female warrior look more like a warrior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F4cc6288e-f295-4ea9-addf-5330c66ee4bb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;4cc6288e-f295-4ea9-addf-5330c66ee4bb.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 2: The original and remastered Amazon warriors</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The same situation also appears in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, “Only for PlayStation”. Aloy goes from an unrecognized marginal character to a hero with a mission. Her agility and wisdom are no less than any male. The game strongly downplays the sense of gender in the tribe. Perhaps the development team hopes that players will feel the charm of the character itself, not her gender or appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F7e1f0cbd-09d1-4f86-9dc5-148afa9175d6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;7e1f0cbd-09d1-4f86-9dc5-148afa9175d6.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3: Horizon heroine Aloy</em></p>

<p>Such examples are becoming more and more common in overseas masterpieces, and these situations have indeed been resisted by some players. At this time, bring the topic back. The male characters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> did not take the route of the celestial beings in the previous domestic online games and single-player RPGs, but chose a more tough guy route, which is determined by the project team’s positioning of each character. But the result is that no matter how the style of fashion is designed, it will not be as acceptable as the female characters when placed on the tough guy role. This is a choice.</p>
<h2 id="Unified-Aesthetics-but-Not-Completely-Unified"><a href="#Unified-Aesthetics-but-Not-Completely-Unified" class="headerlink" title="Unified Aesthetics, but Not Completely Unified"></a>Unified Aesthetics, but Not Completely Unified</h2><p>The above-mentioned is indeed the change of all the major trends, but people’s aesthetic preferences must be different. For example, men and women have different aesthetics for specific skins. For example, a costume called “Butterfly Dream” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has reached the highest quality - red. As a red skin, whether compared with the red skin of the same level or with other appearances of Kurumi, the popularity of this appearance has not reached the expected level. Because as the highest quality skin, the developer certainly believes that this skin’s design sense, special effects and gorgeousness have reached the highest level. We also hope that this skin will become the most acclaimed skin, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F971183d8-12cc-4f9f-b77f-568f18659f3a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;971183d8-12cc-4f9f-b77f-568f18659f3a.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4: Red skin “Butterfly Dream”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>According to our research, most men praised the “Butterfly Dream” costume, but when it came to female players, the girls’ praise for Butterfly Dream plummeted, and they also put forward various suggestions about the costume. Of course, gender is only one of the important influencing factors. If other cross-analysis is done, other interesting answers may be obtained, but it is certain that the aesthetics of different players are absolutely different. Previously, it was said that tough guys may not be as popular as tall and slender men, but it is only a trend. The composition of players is still a factor that game developers have to consider.</p>
<h2 id="Rationality-in-Sensibility"><a href="#Rationality-in-Sensibility" class="headerlink" title="Rationality in Sensibility"></a>Rationality in Sensibility</h2><p>Regarding whether the character&#x2F;skin looks good, there is actually another rule, that is, white&#x2F;light-colored skins will be more popular than black&#x2F;dark-colored skins. In skins of the same quality, light-colored skins will be better than dark-colored skins. This has almost become an objective rule, and even the color system has become the most important factor for players to choose, and the sensitivity has exceeded the quality. A purple-quality light-colored skin may be more popular than a yellow-quality dark-colored skin. But why is this the case?</p>
<p>This question seems very emotional and there is no logic to speak of. This is indeed the case. It is difficult for you to directly answer why the same skin is more popular in white than in black. But in fact, there must be a trace of rationality in sensibility. We have considered many factors, such as the background when trying on clothes, the relationship between texture and color, the fit of the skin and the character, and so on. For example, the influence of background and light. Under daily light, the lighter the shape, the more obvious the light and shadow effect, and the more obvious the contrast between light and dark. This is why beginners in sketching initially draw white plaster geometric bodies instead of black geometric bodies. The more common principle is makeup. Eyeliner, nose shadow, lipstick, and eyebrow trimming are all to highlight the facial features, while the foundation is to weaken the details of the cheeks, such as some spots, scars, and pores, so that people’s attention is focused on the facial features. So much effort is spent on the facial features, it is to make the contrast stronger. Of course, a whiter skin tone can also be easier to set off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Fc466ca73-bb81-4dae-8353-b857f00d7eb1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;c466ca73-bb81-4dae-8353-b857f00d7eb1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5: White makes objects more three-dimensional</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the fit of the skin and the character is another very key factor. In our research process, we found that players have a specific “color positioning” for each character of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. For example, players think that Ning Hongye should be red, Kurumi should be pink, and Canaan should be white. This will also become another important factor affecting players’ purchase. For example, although the quality of Kurumi’s pink appearance is not the highest, even just blue, players’ evaluation of it will exceed many higher-quality skins.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Returning to the question at the beginning of the full text: what kind of characters and appearances will be favored by players, it is difficult to come to a certain answer. People’s views on “beauty” have been changing and have never been unified, but from the above discussion, we may be able to get a glimpse of the aesthetic concepts of different players. In fact, from another perspective, the design of each character image or skin is the product of the careful conception of art designers. After being imported into the game, there may be comparisons of high and low sales, but everyone’s pursuit of beauty is always unrelenting. Perhaps it is precisely because of their wild imagination that people’s cognition of “beauty” has no conclusion.</p>
