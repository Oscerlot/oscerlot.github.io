<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Under the current social and technological conditions, especially with remote work during the pandemic, people have long accepted and recognized the communication method of “not being physically present together”. The virtual situation, also “not being physically present”, no longer gives people a false feeling. Instead, it is a situation with sufficient interaction capabilities and even can meet certain social needs. The “socialization” of games has become an obvious trend. Interactions within the game context (virtual character draws, appearance displays, ranking announcements, etc.) enhance players’ immersion in the virtual world and their self-identification in the game, thereby trusting the game world and generating a sense of dependence and companionship, thus achieving emotional connection.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="I-Three-Types-of-Emotional-Connection"><a href="#I-Three-Types-of-Emotional-Connection" class="headerlink" title="I. Three Types of Emotional Connection"></a>I. Three Types of Emotional Connection</h2><h3 id="Self-Identity-Based-on-Pursuing-Difference"><a href="#Self-Identity-Based-on-Pursuing-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Self-Identity Based on Pursuing Difference"></a>Self-Identity Based on Pursuing Difference</h3><p>Let’s recall the scene of starting a new game for the first time. After entering the game context and accepting the rules, you will be given a specific value and informed of a clear evaluation system. As a result, the differences and stratification between you and other players are inevitable. Taking the card RPG mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> as an example, under the battle mechanism, the sense of accomplishment brought by victory, the sense of conquest brought by duels, and even the sense of loss after failure will provide players with strong emotional energy, and rankings and tiers will also give players clear level differences, thereby enhancing players’ dependence and identification with this game context.</p>

<p>A game often takes no more than 3 minutes. Frequent participation will strengthen the participant’s identification with their player identity, and then pursue their self-identification in this “small society”. After generating identity, pursuing differentiation becomes the player’s only choice. Drawing “legendary” level cards, obtaining better wands, card upgrades, costumes, etc., this pursuit of symbolic differences and instrumental purposes, in turn, creates players’ emotional connection with the game context.</p>
<h3 id="Role-Identity-Based-on-Virtual-Objects"><a href="#Role-Identity-Based-on-Virtual-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Role Identity Based on Virtual Objects"></a>Role Identity Based on Virtual Objects</h3><p>Designers of nurturing games will reconstruct virtual characters in multiple ways. This beloved character often has a rich backstory and exquisite character art, and shows more or less affection for the role played by the player. Players will have a lot of shared experiences with virtual characters through their own perspective, or learn the “unknown” secrets of virtual characters from a bystander’s perspective that only the role played by the player knows. Strategies such as physical participation restrictions and CV dubbing in the game enhance the realism of virtual characters. The complete interaction ritual chain strengthens the player’s identification with the game context and virtual characters.</p>

<p>Games with elements of simulation, strategy, role-playing, and social interaction will create a high degree of mutual subjectivity between players and virtual characters through interaction with NPCs or the main storyline, enhancing players’ identification with the game context and virtual characters. In <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, NPC residents are designed to have feelings. When players have not logged in to the game for a long time, the game world is also running smoothly. When the player logs in again, the NPC residents will also greet them like old friends in reality, thus further creating a sense of participation for the player that “in the process of playing the game, I feel that I am integrated with the people or things in the game”.</p>

<h3 id="Group-Identity-Based-on-Social-Recognition"><a href="#Group-Identity-Based-on-Social-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Group Identity Based on Social Recognition"></a>Group Identity Based on Social Recognition</h3><p>Whether it is pursuing unconventionality, identity tags, or investing emotions in virtual characters, what is implied is the player’s pursuit of a sense of identity and unity in real life. Some players start a new game and invest energy and resources because the game can be used as a social means to facilitate participants to integrate into different groups. When a game becomes popular, people who don’t know or haven’t played it are likely to become “social orphans”. There are also many players who obtain emotional support through the game experience to achieve a good state in real life and work.</p>

<h2 id="II-Emotional-Connection-where-Three-Types-Interact"><a href="#II-Emotional-Connection-where-Three-Types-Interact" class="headerlink" title="II. Emotional Connection where Three Types Interact"></a>II. Emotional Connection where Three Types Interact</h2><p>Players first actively or passively participate in the game context due to personal preferences or social needs, and these three types of identification work independently or together. Driven by a sense of identity, players make virtual consumption in the game, and complete the reproduction of emotional connection in continuous participation. Players’ continuous participation in the game context is precisely the process of production and reproduction of three types of identification, and the three types of emotional connection are cause and effect in different specific situations.</p>
<p>In the MMORPG world, players enter and participate in game activities as virtual characters. The character is the incarnation of the player himself. When interacting in online games, players exist in virtual identities, have self-identification with the character, and have role-identification with other character images that promote the development of the plot. The exquisite graphics and rich plot design in MMORPG games have prompted players to interact with scenery screenshots and character selfie screenshots in the game, and even some players will make game content into video clips and post them on social media platforms to show other players their own stories in the game. Such short videos not only embody the player’s image in the game, but also derive a multi-faceted display of the player’s game skill level, game experience, and even economic capital investment. The more likes and comments, the more players can gain a sense of superiority in the game group, thus generating the reproduction of emotional connection.</p>

<h2 id="III-Conclusion"><a href="#III-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="III. Conclusion"></a>III. Conclusion</h2><p>Games do not only attract players with storylines. What is more attractive than content and plot are emotional factors. In the process of being in the game, players can further have the desire to explore because of the stimulation of emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and these emotional energies are also the deep purpose of players’ investment in the game. Only by achieving emotional connection and the reproduction of emotional connection can the game firmly grasp the user’s heart.</p>
