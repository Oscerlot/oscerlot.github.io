<p>We have a lot of interpersonal relationships in real life. Besides ourselves, we have parents, siblings, relatives, partners, children, friends, and other relationship chains. If we compare ourselves to a small stone, throwing this stone into the water, the ripples that spread out are people with varying degrees of intimacy with us.</p>
<p>In academic research, there are two types of intimate relationships: broad intimate relationships and narrow intimate relationships. Broad intimate relationships include parent-child relationships, kinship, friendships, partner relationships, and so on. Narrow intimate relationships in academia refer more to partner relationships, that is, the two parties in the relationship are lovers.</p>
<p>This article mainly focuses on narrow intimate relationships, introducing how online intimate relationships are formed, consumption affected by intimate relationships, and its inspiration for user research. At the same time, for many people, partner relationships have a very strong impact on people’s lives and happiness (Berscheid and Reis, 1998) - this kind of intimate relationship with a partner can be said to be one of the most important relationships for people.</p>
<h2 id="1-Online-Intimate-Relationships-and-Intimate-Relationships-in-Games"><a href="#1-Online-Intimate-Relationships-and-Intimate-Relationships-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Online Intimate Relationships and Intimate Relationships in Games"></a>1. Online Intimate Relationships and Intimate Relationships in Games</h2><p>With the Internet now deeply penetrating thousands of households, communication through the Internet has become very common. And this communication is not limited to the traditional sending and receiving of messages, but extends to the sharing and display of personal unique messages and the establishment of online interpersonal relationships with others. People on the Internet may be a replica of their real life, or they may be very different from themselves in real life. Some people are even more “socially phobic” in real life, but they are like fish in water on the Internet and can find friends more easily.</p>
<p>In this case, online intimate relationships have also emerged. Perhaps, this phenomenon can be crudely explained as “online dating.” Online intimate relationships are different from intimate relationships in reality. On the Internet, the two parties in an intimate relationship may not have met, but the Internet provides them with a place and scene for communication.</p>
<p>How do online intimate relationships form? Some studies have shown that online intimate relationships reflect a spiritual intimacy. They are willing to reveal themselves to each other and share their worldview (Merkle and Richardson, 2000). On the Internet, due to the existence of anonymity, people tend to reveal themselves more when they meet strangers than in real life, and feel more comfortable expressing themselves to others than in real life. More self-disclosure lays the foundation for the development of online intimate relationships. When the two parties get to know each other in constant self-disclosure and establish a sense of trust, it will make their feelings more intimate. In general, the Internet provides channels and scenarios for both parties to show themselves to each other. People can show what they are like to each other according to their own ideas, which on the one hand pleases themselves, and on the other hand also promotes the budding of the relationship between the two parties.</p>
<p>The formation process of online intimate relationships also has obvious drawbacks. What both parties reveal to each other is what they want the other party to see, that is, there is some beautification behavior. Under the beautification behavior, both parties will form a more positive impression of each other. In addition to the information sent may be beautified, the person receiving the information may also beautify this information, constructing a perfect image in their mind.</p>
<p>The intimate relationship in the game is a typical online intimate relationship. Games provide players with a stage to show each other. Players complete various tasks in the game. They will clear a certain dungeon together, fight a small&#x2F;large battle together, explore the entire game world together, and take photos at beautiful scenic spots together. Games not only provide players with the opportunity to reveal themselves, but also create some content for self-disclosure that other online intimate relationships do not have. That is, game players can show what kind of people they are through the game, and the game itself is also the content they display - PVE commander, gang leader, puzzle solver, etc. The game enriches the connotation that people can reveal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fdccd2ca7-0b42-44b4-b379-a9521b7f086f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;dccd2ca7-0b42-44b4-b379-a9521b7f086f.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition, many games, especially MMOs, also provide “official endorsement” for online intimate relationships. Players can form couples or even marry in the game, making the intimate relationship in the game more solemn.</p>
<h2 id="2-Intimate-Relationships-and-In-Game-Purchases"><a href="#2-Intimate-Relationships-and-In-Game-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="2. Intimate Relationships and In-Game Purchases"></a>2. Intimate Relationships and In-Game Purchases</h2><p>Intimate relationships can influence users’ purchases to a certain extent. For example, we often see couples buying couple outfits, couple accessories (such as couple rings, mobile phone cases), and using couple avatars to show their partner relationship with their significant other. In psychology, we use the consistency pursued by both partners to explain this phenomenon, that is, the two parties in an intimate relationship use consistent things to show their intimacy. The same is true in games. Many “couples” in games will show their couple relationship by purchasing men’s&#x2F;women’s fashion of the same series, purchasing the same accessories and pendants, and using couple names that are antithetical.</p>
<p>In this case, the game will also set up corresponding content to meet the consistency pursued by both parties in the intimate relationship. For example, <em>Justice Online</em> will release matching couple outfits for men and women on Valentine’s Day, Qixi Festival, 520, and other important lover’s festivals, which has been well received by players.</p>

<p>But do both parties in an intimate relationship always pursue this consistency? Not necessarily. When the two parties in an intimate relationship become more and more intimate, they will regard each other as part of their self-awareness, that is, the two people are one. In this case, they will involuntarily complement each other when making purchases. For example, in the game, one party already owns pet A. In the eyes of the other party, they, as a whole, both own pet A. Therefore, in the following choices, they will tend to buy pet B or other things. Because in the eyes of the other party, he&#x2F;she already owns pet A, so he&#x2F;she will not spend resources on repeated purchases, but will buy others to enrich the items they all have.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a friend’s intimate relationship, not a couple’s relationship, to illustrate. For example, <em>Justice Online</em> launched seven clothes with the same style but different color schemes on Double Eleven in 2021. Many “sisters” in the game each own one. The “Seven Fairies” standing together include all color schemes, which is very eye-catching. Each member psychologically believes that they have more than one, and the ownership of friends satisfies the player’s psychology to a certain extent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Ffa389301-81a7-48c5-8c37-6e455101ca87.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;fa389301-81a7-48c5-8c37-6e455101ca87.png"></p>
<p>So when we as user researchers study this situation, we must pay attention not to look at the problem with a single eye, but to combine the factors that affect the behavior of intimate relationships, such as the intimacy between partners, the characteristics of the product, etc., and consider the real needs of both parties. When they will tend to consistent consumption and when they will tend to complementary consumption, there are different answers in different scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, the intimate relationship that this article focuses on and discusses is a narrow intimate relationship. From a broad perspective, parent-child, kinship, friends, etc. are all within the scope of intimate relationships. They are also affected by intimacy and other factors to a certain extent. Will affect the behavior of users&#x2F;players. These interpersonal relationships can more or less find a correspondence in current online games - such as sworn brothers, fixed teams, gangs, etc. commonly seen in major games. Therefore, broad intimate relationships are also worthy of attention for user researchers, especially game user experience researchers.</p>
