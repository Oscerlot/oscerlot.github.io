<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This article is a reprint from the WeChat public account “手游那些事” (shouyou naxie shi - “Those Things About Mobile Games”). The content is compiled from a collaborative course between NetEase Leihuo Games and Peking University, with Leihuo User Experience Center participating in the user research part of the sharing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is well known that NetEase’s MMO products have always performed very well, with many products firmly ranking at the top of the grossing charts. For example, one of its flagship products, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game, has been online for two years and still ranks in the top 10 of the Chinese App Store’s top-grossing games.</p>
<p>The secret of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, as a two-year-old “old game”, is still able to capture users lies in its social system. On the Internet, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game is jokingly referred to by some players as a large-scale social dating mobile game—this to some extent reflects the weight of the social system in this game. In the industry, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game has also been known for its excellent social design.</p>
<p>In the recent collaborative course between NetEase Leihuo Games and Peking University, Yao Yuan, the lead planner of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, shared her views on “the essence of game user experience” and the methods and principles of game social gameplay design; Liu Yongcheng, head of Leihuo UX User Experience Center, shared how UX business provides scientific data support for user experience design.</p>
<p>The following is a compilation of the content of the class:</p>
<h2 id="I-“Only-Attracting-Players-is-the-Only-Criterion-for-Judging-the-Excellence-of-a-Game”"><a href="#I-“Only-Attracting-Players-is-the-Only-Criterion-for-Judging-the-Excellence-of-a-Game”" class="headerlink" title="I. “Only Attracting Players is the Only Criterion for Judging the Excellence of a Game”"></a>I. “Only Attracting Players is the Only Criterion for Judging the Excellence of a Game”</h2><p>The user experience we usually talk about is about the user’s personal feelings, mainly emphasizing the user’s emotions and feelings. In a broad sense, user experience includes everything that players feel in the game, including visual experience, story experience, social experience, combat experience, growth experience, and so on.</p>
<p>There used to be a saying in game development: fun is the only criterion for testing a game. In Yao Yuan’s view, this statement is no longer suitable for current games. Attracting players is the only criterion for judging the excellence of a game.</p>
<p>How can we attract players? That is to meet the needs of users.</p>
<p>Yao Yuan led the audience to review the history of Richard Bartle, Nick Yee and others in the study of player needs and motivations. Based on the theory of evolution, she discussed the essence of games from a unique perspective—games are actually simulations of reality, and players are actually conducting preparedness environmental adaptation training. Starting from the essence of the game, Yao Yuan summarized the universal player needs into three points: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.</p>
<h2 id="II-How-to-Conduct-User-Experience-Design-from-a-Product-Perspective"><a href="#II-How-to-Conduct-User-Experience-Design-from-a-Product-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="II. How to Conduct User Experience Design from a Product Perspective?"></a>II. How to Conduct User Experience Design from a Product Perspective?</h2><p>Among the three player needs, relatedness is the most basic one. Relatedness is generated by social interaction, and in game design, social interaction is a very important part of user experience design.</p>
<p>So how does <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> design its social system? Yao Yuan mainly shared the following three points.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Interaction is Based on Player Identity Recognition, and Name is an Important Expression Tool</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It can be said that the social relationships of current domestic games are very complicated. Friends, mentors and apprentices, sworn brothers, couples, teams, groups… a wide variety, like a deluxe family bucket. However, in all current MMO games, these are already standard.</p>
<p>Everyone is doing social networking and wants to integrate all relationships into the game. But few people consider from the very beginning of game social interaction why social interaction is generated.</p>
<p>Yao Yuan first explained the essence of social interaction from a biological perspective: “When I was doing my Ph.D., I studied a kind of woodpecker. They are polygamous and live together without shame. During our research, we came up with a hypothesis that if this species has a highly socialized society, each of its individuals should be identifiable. Because only when individuals are identified can all their subsequent relationships, or strategies based on individuals, be possible. Therefore, the beginning of social interaction is the identification of identity. Identity is very important.”</p>
<p>Social interaction is based on identity recognition, so how is it reflected in the game? Yao Yuan took Chen Xinghan’s new work “Sky: Children of the Light” as an example to explain the importance of names for game player identity recognition.</p>
<p>In “Sky: Children of the Light”, everyone’s character looks the same. But when the player’s friendship with a character increases, the player can give the other party a name. “At this time, this person has a completely different meaning to you. You can see him from a long distance, and you can see him among a group of people, knowing that you have soared in the clouds together. For players in the game world, compared to the more versatile appearance, the name is a particularly good tool to express personal identity.”</p>
<p>In addition, Yao Yuan also shared an idea about setting the length of the name: “The space of mobile games is limited. If the name is too long, it will definitely affect the length of the information displayed later, and if it is too short, it will not be enough to express personal characteristics. But seven characters is a seven-character poem length for Chinese people, which is a very good format for players to name and express their inner feelings. Therefore, the name length of our <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game is finally set to seven characters, which is a little less than the PC version.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Social Immersion is More Important than Visual and Narrative Immersion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the game, making social connections is like the process of “establishing connections” described in “The Little Prince”. This process requires a certain social space, that is, it is necessary to give players a chance to settle their social relationships. “In the game, we need to let two people see each other and understand each other’s characteristics at the same time or in the same space, which can already provide them with a very good social space.”</p>
<p>How to use elements in the game to create a social space for players? Yao Yuan used the chat channel of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> as an example.</p>
<p>Due to the space limitations of the mobile game interface, most of the real-time games on the market will shrink the chat channel to a button on the main interface, and players will only see the chat channel when they click the button. But <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> places the chat channel at the bottom of the game’s main interface in order to enhance the player’s social immersion.</p>
<p>“Maybe the information displayed here is not enough, but for players, they can find that there are always active players talking in the world.” Usually, most games emphasize the immersion of game plots and visuals, but Yao Yuan believes that for MMORPG games, social immersion is much more important than immersion in visuals and stories.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Design Social Gameplay by Considering Players’ Emotional Needs and “Labeling”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game also has unique “tips” when designing social gameplay.</p>
<p>First of all, when making game content, it is necessary to consider its positioning and what kind of emotions and needs the players involved will have.</p>
<p>In class, Yao Yuan threw out a question: “If you design a wedding system in an online game, what content do you think should be put in?” As soon as the question came out, the students below spoke up. Some said that there should be a wedding parade, some said that there should be invitations and dresses—these are common elements of wedding systems in MMO games already on the market.</p>
<p>“Actually, we have implemented all the above functions in the game, but we have specially made a function in the wedding, that is, players can kill people in this scene.” Yao Yuan said an interesting setting in the wedding gameplay of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game. This answer is something most people did not expect.</p>
<p>“Actually, this is a strong interaction between players: to kill him. This is also the experience we have gained from playing games before: single players who come to watch the ceremony, out of the spirit of the FFF group, will especially want to kill the newlyweds; on the other hand, the newlyweds may also want to show ‘the couple work together, and their strength can break gold’—therefore, the wedding scene is often also a scene of tragedy, and all players have a very happy melee together.” This experience is to a certain extent similar to the process of guests making trouble in the bridal chamber in reality, achieving the same effect by “killing people”, so this seemingly strange gameplay can be recognized by players.</p>
<p>Secondly, when making social gameplay, it is necessary to add an emotional or experience label to the gameplay at the beginning of the design, as the basic purpose and principle of making this type of gameplay.</p>
<p>Regarding this method, Yao Yuan used the “Monk System” in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game as an example. From the PC version to the mobile version, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> will set up a “strange” “Monk System”: once the player feels that he has seen through the world of mortals, he can go to the abbot of Bao’en Temple to apply for monkhood. After becoming a monk, you can only sweep the floor, chant scriptures, and ring the bell in the temple. Most of the time, you cannot leave the scene, cannot complete daily tasks, cannot marry, cannot become sworn brothers, and cannot kill people.</p>
<p>In many cases, when players have the idea of churning in the game, they may not necessarily want to leave the game, but just need a way to vent their emotions, and to get some attention and comfort. Therefore, “becoming a monk” is actually a process for players to act like a spoiled child to their friends, and a way to meet the player’s need to “be valued”. This is reflected in the friend interaction in the “Monk System”: for example, when player A becomes a monk, the system will push this message to his friends, and friends can redeem the monk player by donating incense money. This system sounds completely “anti-social”. Apart from gaining an immersive experience of “becoming a monk”, this system is negative for social interaction and even for game experience. So why design such a system? What kind of emotional label is given to it? The answer is something that many people can’t think of—Tsundere.</p>
<p>In addition, Yao Yuan also used the question-answering system in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game with “recognition” and “topic” as labels, the imperial examination system with “timeliness” as a label, and the guild flower battle gameplay with “noise” as a label to illustrate the importance of labeling when designing social gameplay.</p>
<p>When all the labels are integrated, it will eventually create a <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> social system formed by real players, with its unique game temperament. Compared to a sophisticated and luxurious but indifferent metropolis, it is more like a small town full of human touch—you often meet acquaintances on the street, and you can chat about gossip when you meet. In the real world, this feeling may only be rooted in the memories of our parents or when we were young. But in the world of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, it belongs to the young people’s world, rooted in Chinese culture, and has a lively and bustling atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the end, Yao Yuan summarized how to start to improve the player’s game experience:</p>
<p>First, we need to analyze the needs of players and recognize the needs of players.</p>
<p>Second, we ourselves must also actively practice and invest in experiencing the game, and iterate the game based on the feedback of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Third, any design we make must be based on rational analysis, including emotional experience factors are also part of our rational analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, please remember, “The player is always your best friend.” Stand with the users, understand their needs, and put people first, this is the foundation of all user experience design.</p>
<h2 id="III-UX-Business-Provides-Scientific-Data-for-User-Experience-Design"><a href="#III-UX-Business-Provides-Scientific-Data-for-User-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="III. UX Business Provides Scientific Data for User Experience Design"></a>III. UX Business Provides Scientific Data for User Experience Design</h2><p>After Yao Yuan talked about game user experience and the design of social gameplay in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> from the product direction, Liu Yongcheng, head of Leihuo User Research Center, explained how UX business systematically forms user experience support from the perspective of the work of the user experience department. “The product is a decision-maker, and the user experience is a supporter. User experience is also the last specialized game profession to enter the game industry in the entire game industry.”</p>
<p>The work goal of the user experience department is to use scientific methods to form qualitative and quantitative data to provide decision support, thereby connecting players and game development groups.</p>
<p>Liu Yongcheng said that during the testing period of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game, the user experience department conducted several tests, continuously analyzing the causes of player churn, public opinion, player behavior in the game, game problems, and the highlights of alternative competing products, and visualized them through the data platform. These have played a very important role in the design of the game’s social gameplay and the improvement of the product.</p>
<p>From the content of Yao Yuan and Liu Yongcheng’s lectures, the reasons for the success of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game in game social interaction can ultimately be attributed to two major aspects—people-oriented social design concepts and scientific user experience data.</p>

    <title>Talking About Design Questioning - IXDC 2018 Summary Sharing (Part 1)</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190505/28584_811830.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IXDC International Experience Design Conference is one of the most prestigious design conferences in the industry. Every year, it invites many industry leaders and experts to share cutting-edge design achievements and the latest design cases through keynote speeches and workshops. As a newbie in the design industry, I have long been yearning for this conference. Last year, I finally had the honor to participate for the first time. During the 4-day conference, I gained a lot. Below I will share some of my gains from this conference.</p>
<h2 id="Talking-About-Design-Questioning"><a href="#Talking-About-Design-Questioning" class="headerlink" title="Talking About Design Questioning"></a>Talking About Design Questioning</h2><p>The first workshop I attended was presented by Li Yue, a senior user experience designer at Didi Chuxing’s CDX, titled “Making Good Use of the [Experience + Data Dual-Drive Model] to Derive Good Design”. It mainly used two cases to illustrate how to combine one’s own work and experience preferences to build a design thinking model suitable for oneself, and how to use the design model to guide the design and derive more effective design solutions. I think the biggest gain from this is not the design model itself, but the thinking about the essence of design and the most important and easily overlooked point in the design process: design questioning.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Mr. Li introduced the Double Diamond design model proposed by the British Industrial Design Association, as shown in the figure. In this course, we mainly involved the two parts in the red box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Ffe6fdfad-ef0a-4fff-a6ad-9908d2136022.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;fe6fdfad-ef0a-4fff-a6ad-9908d2136022.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="A-Little-Story"><a href="#A-Little-Story" class="headerlink" title="A Little Story"></a>A Little Story</h3><p>Let’s start with a little story. A bird is flying and is very thirsty. At this time, it finds a bottle on the ground, and there is water in the bottle. How can the bird drink the water in the bottle? At that time, everyone put forward their own solutions, and almost everyone’s solutions focused on how to solve the problem of the contact point between the bird and the bottle. But if we look closely at this question, is it essentially the bird’s need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fa7ef8c8b-dffc-4607-8fd5-8590f35b22ba.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;a7ef8c8b-dffc-4607-8fd5-8590f35b22ba.jpg"></p>
<p>As shown in the figure, through design questioning, we find that the bird’s idea of drinking water from the bottle is essentially the bird’s thirst need. Then, only by solving this essential need can the bird be most satisfied, so the path to solving the problem is broader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F557309e7-85ce-40b8-9a4d-b4c82757144a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;557309e7-85ce-40b8-9a4d-b4c82757144a.jpg"></p>
<p>Let’s interpret it in detail with cases.</p>
<h3 id="Case-1"><a href="#Case-1" class="headerlink" title="Case 1"></a>Case 1</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fafa7c5d2-b8b7-40c8-80ad-f085dc68310a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;afa7c5d2-b8b7-40c8-80ad-f085dc68310a.jpg"></p>
<p>Xiaoju Flash Report is Didi’s internal reimbursement software, but recently their product team is not very happy, because colleagues in the company are complaining: “It’s so difficult to use!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Ffe6b3257-f5f5-4d41-9309-769c121bbdb3.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;fe6b3257-f5f5-4d41-9309-769c121bbdb3.jpg"></p>
<p>In response to this problem, Didi’s design team also used the 5 Whys method to ask the root cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F02b46362-00fc-4777-9cf1-158dd3ef21ec.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;02b46362-00fc-4777-9cf1-158dd3ef21ec.jpg"></p>
<p>From the questioning process, we found a very interesting point. The new functions added by the product side to improve product satisfaction have reduced the user experience of the product. Then everyone should think carefully, what is the design purpose of this product?</p>
<p><strong>Improve employee reimbursement efficiency</strong></p>
<p>After determining the design goal, the next step is to determine the users. The main users of reimbursement apps include three groups:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F3c0953be-c364-4b89-bcc1-17754a136c69.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;3c0953be-c364-4b89-bcc1-17754a136c69.jpg"></p>
<p>The specific design part is not closely related to the theme of this sharing, so it will not be repeated.</p>
<h3 id="Case-2"><a href="#Case-2" class="headerlink" title="Case 2"></a>Case 2</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F4d058fa2-4b3a-4e89-8931-29a6e9f990bd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;4d058fa2-4b3a-4e89-8931-29a6e9f990bd.jpg"></p>
<p>Jushi Recorder is a car video recorder launched by Didi, but recently their product side is also not very happy, because too few videos are successfully extracted from the recorder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F7be272e9-450f-4459-a164-2cf0fdac5b1e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;7be272e9-450f-4459-a164-2cf0fdac5b1e.jpg"></p>
<p>In response to this problem, the Didi design team also used the 5 Whys method to ask the root cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fc4a5758e-838e-485e-9e0f-e3739b96ff56.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;c4a5758e-838e-485e-9e0f-e3739b96ff56.jpg"></p>
<p>Through this questioning, we established the goal of the product:</p>
<p><strong>Improve the success rate of uploading appeal videos</strong></p>
<p>But why do we need to achieve this goal? We need to continue to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F94c96e2e-2f00-426b-9ed0-b725f048d9b0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;94c96e2e-2f00-426b-9ed0-b725f048d9b0.jpg"></p>
<p>In this way, we will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and know exactly what aspects need to be optimized in the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fbcaabd4e-49fc-4b6e-8672-6e48cfce6b44.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190505&#x2F;bcaabd4e-49fc-4b6e-8672-6e48cfce6b44.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>In fact, in everyone’s daily life, they often directly receive the needs of the product or planning side and start designing directly. This can easily lead to the later discovery that the content carefully designed by oneself is not what the demander wants, and then fall into the situation of constantly changing. In fact, this is also due to insufficient requirement mining and failure to discover the real essential needs of the demander. When encountering problems, we must ask more questions. It is not only to help the demander diagnose whether it is a pseudo-requirement, but also to understand the problem more comprehensively in this process, so as to determine the design goal and complete the design that satisfies both parties.</p>

    <title>Observations from Overseas Testing in Japan</title>

<p>In April, Hangzhou was already warm and blossoming, starting to move towards summer. I boarded a plane to Tokyo wearing clothes for the approaching summer. However, upon landing, I was greeted by cold rain and wind.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Ffefc9913-78e3-4daf-9084-1d5088e244d2.jpg/size/" alt="Cold Rain and Wind in Tokyo"></p>
<p>The next day, the street intercept test in Tokyo officially began. Walking out of the place where I was staying, I felt the chill of winter, a cold that even a suit jacket couldn’t block. Tokyo seemed to want to hinder our testing in this way. But would we be choked like this?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>The original plan for street intercept testing on the ordinary streets of Akihabara was changed by us, because most of the passers-by were in a hurry and were completely unwilling to stay on the road for even a second.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2F0a450054-6bfb-4a0c-9936-7f7eb7256f40.jpg/size/" alt="Busy Streets of Akihabara"></p>
<p>I began to look for positions at the station that could block some of the wind, waiting for an opportunity to find pedestrians who seemed to be idle. At the same time, as opportunities became fewer, the cafes next to the station also became places I tried.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fc3eba77d-65d7-4309-bd3f-e5a5e8688b7b.jpg/size/" alt="Station and Cafe"></p>
<p>In addition, in order to increase the success rate and sample size, I asked classmates to conduct intercepts at their alma mater’s campus in Tokyo and at the entrances of stations around the campus.</p>
<p>With three approaches, the subsequent intercept tests became relatively smooth.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190505%2Fc5a9a988-8a30-4849-a18d-6a57e667cd7b.jpg/size/" alt="Intercepting at University"></p>
<p>Although there were difficulties in the next two days of interceptions, we successfully overcame them and exceeded the established goals.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>When there are uncertain factors interfering with the test, different strategies should be considered, even changing the tactical direction, to ensure the completion of the established goals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To increase the effective sample size, hiring part-time students and conducting very strict training before they start intercepting is also a good compensation method.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overseas testing is very different from domestic testing. For example, Japanese people attach great importance to privacy, so when it becomes increasingly apparent that this is an issue during the testing process, it is also very important to promptly revise questions involving privacy, which can increase the probability of success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Street intercepts may encounter various types of players. Maintain a good attitude, stay calm and deal with it, and strive to complete the test goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190510/28584_812588.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Last time we shared our observations from player testing in Japan. This time, we want to share some observations from testing in the United States. For this test, we chose Los Angeles as the location, and the testing requirements were to conduct a novice test and a UI interface test for a game.</p>
<h2 id="Test-Preparation"><a href="#Test-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Test Preparation"></a>Test Preparation</h2><p>Upon receiving the request, I felt a bit nervous. Testing novices? Does that mean we need to find a good coffee shop and prepare some <em>‘Fat Otaku Happy Water’</em> (soda, a common term for sugary drinks in some gaming communities.) so that foreigners can sit comfortably and play games? Wouldn’t that mean we have to start making appointments with players in China?</p>
<p>After some intense brainstorming, we finally decided to conduct the test in the form of lab testing plus street interviews. There are strictly controlled lab tests, as well as random interviews as a supplement to the results.</p>
<h2 id="Test-Execution"><a href="#Test-Execution" class="headerlink" title="Test Execution"></a>Test Execution</h2><p>Domestic testing is like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F99f15c09-bd1b-475d-9a95-73e79c48fd48.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;99f15c09-bd1b-475d-9a95-73e79c48fd48.jpg"></p>
<p>US testing is like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F024aabf0-71d6-42e5-ace2-9e5248684e5a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;024aabf0-71d6-42e5-ace2-9e5248684e5a.jpg"></p>
<p>Where are the people? Where are the people? Where are the people????</p>
<p>There are many crowded places in China: on the streets, in the dining areas of KFC and McDonald’s, at the entrance of milk tea shops, schools, shopping malls, movie theater entrances…</p>
<p>The United States is really sparsely populated.</p>
<p>In addition, some players indeed didn’t show up at the lab. So I started the long journey of finding people. But we were well prepared. We went to this place:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F29301ded-4f0f-4680-8898-504b4d721609.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;29301ded-4f0f-4680-8898-504b4d721609.jpg"></p>
<p>This place:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F760c43a8-f142-4388-9f99-5b555a7ea3c5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;760c43a8-f142-4388-9f99-5b555a7ea3c5.jpg"></p>
<p>And this place:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F07c63632-d134-4800-8a94-b329fbd91ad5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;07c63632-d134-4800-8a94-b329fbd91ad5.jpg"></p>
<p>Do you think we went to Universal Studios, Santa Monica Beach to eat, drink, have fun, and watch bikini beauties? No~~~ I only saw potential subjects all over the place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2Fe499ba98-a662-44d6-a316-c12838e72ada.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;e499ba98-a662-44d6-a316-c12838e72ada.jpg"></p>
<p>For overseas street interviews, large tourist attractions and beaches are excellent places for testing, because these places not only have a large flow of people, but also provide a large number of resting places (the experience of sitting down to test will be better), not to mention people of all colors and countries from all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F054d37aa-e941-4f54-9355-fe841baaf165.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;054d37aa-e941-4f54-9355-fe841baaf165.jpg"></p>
<p>When you find tourists who have been queuing for half an hour and have nothing to do, don’t hesitate, these are the target players we can recruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F9c4b605b-a02a-4a91-b4ea-e4e2cf0c1bdd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;9c4b605b-a02a-4a91-b4ea-e4e2cf0c1bdd.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, there are also men, women, and children eating in restaurants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F45e64cd8-6c94-4595-b71c-537d442804f5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;45e64cd8-6c94-4595-b71c-537d442804f5.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Player-Characteristics"><a href="#Player-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Player Characteristics"></a>Player Characteristics</h2><p>So after the test, what is the difference between Americans and Japanese?</p>
<p>Japanese people are like this, I call them “superficial brothers” - polite and courteous in conversation, generous in scoring, but when it comes to verbal feedback and game behavior, they start to show “split personality”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2Fd59e3450-c553-41ec-bb5b-60b1b4ee3b66.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;d59e3450-c553-41ec-bb5b-60b1b4ee3b66.jpg"></p>
<p>Americans, on the other hand, are very straightforward and have a sense of American humor. During the testing process, they will be generally more enthusiastic and willing to provide various opinions and suggestions. The completion rate of other columns and suggestion columns in the questionnaire is higher than that in China.</p>
<p>This is our lady who is writing hard to record player opinions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2Fc199aff5-f1ef-4e12-87bb-031893485872.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;c199aff5-f1ef-4e12-87bb-031893485872.jpg"></p>
<p>And young men</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190510%2F572b9167-3bd7-4128-90c8-1bbedfc692f1.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190510&#x2F;572b9167-3bd7-4128-90c8-1bbedfc692f1.jpg"></p>
<p>So what should we pay attention to when receiving such enthusiastic Americans?</p>
<p>The answer is: no fruit, no snacks, but please prepare enough <em>Fat Otaku Happy Water</em> (soda) and potato chips!</p>

    <title>Application of Goal-Oriented Thinking in Requirement Analysis</title>
    <url>/2019/05/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20190516_28584_813758/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190516/28584_813758.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article shares the content of last year’s new campus recruitment training course in Guangzhou. The course includes: Game Understanding, Design Thinking - Requirements and Goals, Design Expression - Creativity, Design Expression - Information Operation Process. Each lesson has been very rewarding. Today, I will share the content about design thinking and use the design of a sign-in interface as a case to introduce my thinking process.</p>
<p>As a designer, when starting work, one often gets stuck in a cliché process. Faced with a requirement, you try to understand what the details of the requirement are, see what the planner needs, look for competing products, learn from what can be applied, and then produce your own design plan. Faced with such a plan, you always cannot pinpoint the good and bad, and will feel mediocre. The cause of this is a lack of a <em>reasonable</em> design goal.</p>
<p>Often in the early stages of design, we would set a very broad design goal, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to design a very interesting interface;</li>
<li>I want to design a very useful interface;</li>
<li>I want to design a very novel interface;</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, such goals are not instructive and do not help the design at all, and in the end, they are easily ignored by ourselves.</p>
<p>So how do you get your design goals? As an interaction designer, you need to meet the needs of the planner, you need to understand what the planner’s goals are, and at the same time analyze what the user’s goals will be, so as to obtain the design goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Fd2d8f506-b29b-4f26-8742-e9fbc0506f1f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;d2d8f506-b29b-4f26-8742-e9fbc0506f1f.jpg"></p>
<p>Planner goals are often related to the potential value of the game, such as increasing game retention, increasing conversion rates, ensuring core experience…</p>
<p>For example, planner requirements: players log in daily and receive 5000 game coins and a random item. Log in for 7 days in a week, and you will get 1 piece of a quarterly limited skin fragment. Each quarter requires 10 fragments to exchange for the limited skin.</p>
<p>I try to analyze as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2F2de849b3-6f80-470f-9bda-5c47bfb24612.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;2de849b3-6f80-470f-9bda-5c47bfb24612.jpg"></p>
<p>By constantly questioning every detail in the requirement to dig out the purpose behind each requirement, and then thinking about what game value the planner wants to reflect by designing these functional points. It is not difficult to find that through layers of thinking, the planner’s ultimate goal is to achieve the effect of “increasing retention” in the sign-in interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2F8097bb76-35f8-48eb-b0f2-29f5cdc92383.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;8097bb76-35f8-48eb-b0f2-29f5cdc92383.jpg"></p>
<p>User goals need to pay attention to what are the characteristics of the target users? What content does the user need to pay attention to in this interface, and what operations will the user perform?</p>
<p>First of all, characteristics, through means to find the target user’s age characteristics, gender characteristics, hobby trends, etc., to help us cater to their preferences.</p>
<p>Secondly, what will users look at? What to do? Still use the above sign-in requirements to analyze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Fe58edfd6-fce0-4c0c-bf50-1c8d635e8efd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;e58edfd6-fce0-4c0c-bf50-1c8d635e8efd.jpg"></p>
<p>By exhausting the user’s behavior path, we can get what information the user will pay attention to in this interface, and the attention to information will also become clear.</p>
<p>After clarifying the planner’s goals and user goals, we also need other dimensions of thinking to supplement our design goals.</p>
<p>For example, the positioning of the sign-in interface, often in the game, the sign-in interface is after selecting the server and before the game starts. This determines that the sign-in interface is first of all an important interface: it determines the player’s first impression; it determines the tone of the game. At the same time, it is also an unimportant interface, it emphasizes use-and-go; do not divert the user’s attention, avoid overshadowing the main content with excessive design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2F686e6526-e527-439a-aa92-6de1ce38eab6.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;686e6526-e527-439a-aa92-6de1ce38eab6.jpg"></p>
<p>After the above analysis, it is easy to get a very detailed design goal, and the subsequent work will be very easy, just design according to the following content one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Ff4c65e99-c304-4a1e-ac3b-850d58724e0e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;f4c65e99-c304-4a1e-ac3b-850d58724e0e.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, as a designer, we are often not satisfied with meeting the design requirements. We all hope that our design is both functional and artistic. This requires designers to deeply explore the core and world view of the game. From this, get any content that can help the design, so as to design works that both yourself and players love.</p>

<p><strong>Do you want to know?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to do interaction iteration?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to make interaction prototypes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to rely on prototypes to increase the persuasiveness of solutions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the tools for interactive prototyping?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What can usability testing at the prototype stage test?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>On May 13th, the eighth lecture of the joint course “Service Innovation Design” by NetEase Leihuo User Experience Center and Zhejiang University (ZJU) gave a detailed lecture on iteration risks and interaction prototypes.</p>
<hr>
<p>This course is mainly divided into three parts: UI iteration risks, introduction and case sharing of interaction prototypes, and tool introduction. It is taught by the interaction design manager of Leihuo UX.</p>
<p>The following are part of the course content:</p>
<h2 id="UI-Iteration-Risks"><a href="#UI-Iteration-Risks" class="headerlink" title="UI Iteration Risks"></a>UI Iteration Risks</h2><ol>
<li>Major experience problems are discovered only after launch.</li>
<li>An important function has always had experience problems, but it has not been solved.</li>
<li>Insufficient innovation in the interaction scheme of core functions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Avoid-Iteration-Risks"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Iteration-Risks" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Iteration Risks"></a>How to Avoid Iteration Risks</h2><p>Iteration is the norm in the process of game development.</p>
<p>Avoid it by making prototypes for testing.</p>
<h2 id="Who-is-the-Prototype-for"><a href="#Who-is-the-Prototype-for" class="headerlink" title="Who is the Prototype for?"></a>Who is the Prototype for?</h2><p>Decision makers - Decision-making</p>
<p>Experiencers - Testing</p>
<p>Designers themselves - Self-testing</p>
<p>Good interface, “looks good” or “smooth” is not the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is to make players feel that their experience is under control, and the prototype is a means to advance the experience.</p>

Customer Journey Map</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2F835b3093-caab-433a-b1f7-840f90a977cf.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;835b3093-caab-433a-b1f7-840f90a977cf.jpg"></p>
<p>At the heart of most customer experience research, journey maps track user-facing interactions with services and represent them as structured visualizations. Typical journey maps are multi-channel and time-based. Creating it requires researchers to identify the touchpoints where users interact with the service, connect these touchpoints as part of the overall experience, and depict the various stages of the experience for further analysis.</p>
<h3 id="02-Service-Blueprint"><a href="#02-Service-Blueprint" class="headerlink" title="02. Service Blueprint"></a>02. Service Blueprint</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Fe4f1c92c-5ff1-4297-8cc6-b2985e6c339e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;e4f1c92c-5ff1-4297-8cc6-b2985e6c339e.jpg"></p>
<p>As a key tool for service design, blueprints depict each component of the service, including users and service providers, their touchpoints, and behind-the-scenes processes. Unlike customer journey maps, these blueprints capture the work of the provider and the key processes of service delivery. Because they run through the user experience, service blueprints can reveal where silos exist in the organization. According to Dana Chisnell, co-founder of the Center for Civic Design, the gaps between these silos often correspond to low points in customer service. Service blueprints are designed to be co-generated and can be a tool to bring together different teams responsible for the discontinuous parts of the service. The process of creating a blueprint itself can foster collaboration and can also reveal areas of overlap and teamwork. Pollaine further suggests creating Journey Summaries, tracking a particular user’s journey through the main stages of the service in order to select touchpoints to focus on.</p>
<h3 id="03-Stakeholder-Map"><a href="#03-Stakeholder-Map" class="headerlink" title="03. Stakeholder Map"></a>03. Stakeholder Map</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Fa084c57a-a860-42f9-ae19-34c6e7263a90.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;a084c57a-a860-42f9-ae19-34c6e7263a90.jpg"></p>
<p>Stakeholder maps identify important internal and external stakeholders and key users, and often describe the relationships between stakeholders and their relative importance. In addition to service design, stakeholder mapping is also used in strategy analysis, project management, and other fields. It helps the team assess how the interests of each stakeholder affect the project and how to address these issues.</p>
<h3 id="04-Expectation-Map"><a href="#04-Expectation-Map" class="headerlink" title="04. Expectation Map"></a>04. Expectation Map</h3><p>Expectation maps build on customer journey maps as a way to visualize customer emotions and desires during the journey. They are usually created during the discovery phase and are designed to represent the dynamically changing expectations of the service, expressing the best experience users can imagine. The map captures expectations in four aspects: seeing, hearing, saying, and doing, as well as thinking and feeling. The map can take a deep look at specific channels or aspects of the service to define where more details are needed. It can be used as a diagnostic tool to pinpoint areas of service that need attention.</p>
<h3 id="05-Customer-Lifecycle-Map"><a href="#05-Customer-Lifecycle-Map" class="headerlink" title="05. Customer Lifecycle Map"></a>05. Customer Lifecycle Map</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2Fe120fa85-19a9-4238-9e2f-ad0108e2d25b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;e120fa85-19a9-4238-9e2f-ad0108e2d25b.jpg"></p>
<p>By providing a comprehensive understanding of the customer’s relationship with the service provider, customer lifecycle maps are often used to highlight points where people may abandon the service. It takes into account the customer’s motivation and momentum overtime and can be described as a series of service journeys.</p>
<h3 id="06-Design-Scenario"><a href="#06-Design-Scenario" class="headerlink" title="06. Design Scenario"></a>06. Design Scenario</h3><p>This tool can combine several other techniques to integrate storyboards or characters into a hypothetical story. Driven by user research conducted by the team, the scenario can be particularly helpful in examining potential problems that a new service concept may encounter, or in constructing negative scenarios, exploring what might get worse to highlight what works well in practice. Design scenarios can also help teams build around a clear vision.</p>
<h3 id="07-Organizational-Impact-Analysis"><a href="#07-Organizational-Impact-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="07. Organizational Impact Analysis"></a>07. Organizational Impact Analysis</h3><p>This additional tool is provided to establish a direct link between the customer experience and the delivery mechanism. It identifies the impact of customer stages or channels on different departments. This analysis is designed to help teams plan collaboration with internal stakeholders and pave the way for change.</p>
<h3 id="08-Business-Model-Canvas"><a href="#08-Business-Model-Canvas" class="headerlink" title="08. Business Model Canvas"></a>08. Business Model Canvas</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190516%2F7a317009-78fa-4417-a5bb-fa0220ad2033.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190516&#x2F;7a317009-78fa-4417-a5bb-fa0220ad2033.jpg"></p>
<p>The canvas replaces the traditional business plan to identify the elements of a sustainable service product. Although the canvas is usually applied to private sector services, public sector organizations can use this tool to help departments see themselves as service-centric businesses, including how their key activities support a value proposition that serves specific customer relationships. The business model canvas contains nine sectors that can be filled in collaboratively to help service providers simulate various aspects of their service offerings.</p>

<p>Lab testing is a common method of interacting with players in user experience research, and the feedback from player testing is more real and direct, which can facilitate product iteration and optimization. So today, let’s briefly introduce our lab testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2Fdcbd2900-eae6-4269-a2a5-9cd148b8136f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;dcbd2900-eae6-4269-a2a5-9cd148b8136f.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1: Qingzhiwu Lab</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We currently use two labs, the Qingzhiwu Lab and the in-house lab. The Qingzhiwu Lab is located near the Yuquan Campus of Zhejiang University, in the urban area, making it convenient for players to participate in testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F8c847fdf-1767-4c61-8bba-7a7bd0f19821.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;8c847fdf-1767-4c61-8bba-7a7bd0f19821.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 2: Qingzhiwu Lab</em></p>

<p>The key point of lab testing is to invite specific players (players with certain gaming experience, demographic indicators, and game experience depth) to the lab for a longer game experience, generally limited to 2 hours, observe their game experience behavior, pay attention to players’ attitudes and feedback, and use various methods to evaluate players’ experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F5a9da00c-14d4-482e-a64f-20f4103138bb.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;5a9da00c-14d4-482e-a64f-20f4103138bb.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3: In-house Eye-Tracking Lab</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Lab testing will test and iterate on the core experience of the game, the novice process experience, the interaction of key interfaces in the game, new game activities or gameplay versions, etc. It can be said that it runs through the entire process of game development to online operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F8316984f-1251-489c-a5dd-660db3042f78.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;8316984f-1251-489c-a5dd-660db3042f78.jpg"></p>
<p>Before the test, we will conduct a mock test. One person plays the role of the participant experiencing the game, and multiple people play the role of the tester to observe and use the corresponding observation sheet to fill in. After the mock execution is completed, there will be a review to optimize the testing process and the documents used for testing. Make the subsequent formal testing smoother and more professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F6aaf2d45-ef5a-43a8-9780-a2e420a6382a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;6aaf2d45-ef5a-43a8-9780-a2e420a6382a.jpg"></p>
<p>Before the test starts, we need to ensure that the players arrive on time. We will contact the players in advance by text message and phone. The test equipment will be debugged and can be used normally during the test for the game experience, reducing interruptions and facilitating the smooth progress of our test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F7736a47e-bda3-4a9c-90ca-48ab69750b93.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;7736a47e-bda3-4a9c-90ca-48ab69750b93.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4: Qingzhiwu <em>Justice Online</em> Lab Test</em></p>

    <title>Mobile Game Social System - Detailed Explanation of Friends Interface Interaction Design</title>
    <url>/2019/05/17/netease-ux-articles/news_20190517_28584_813963/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190517/28584_813963.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The social system has always been an indispensable part of many games. Although it is not directly related to the core gameplay, it is a key system to increase player immersion and improve retention. Especially for MMO products with strong social interaction, the social system plays a key role. For example, our <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game is known for its excellent social design.</p>
<p>From the perspective of planning, when designing a social system, we usually consider how to meet the needs of players, how to promote the establishment of a player network, how to use the elements in the game to create a social space for players, and so on. As interaction designers, when we are involved in social system design, we need to consider more about how to improve system usability, reduce interruptions, and satisfy the rational layout of all functions.</p>
<p>Here, we focus on the main operating system in the mobile game social system - the friends interface, and sort out the interaction design elements of the friends interface.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="I-Functional-Block-Breakdown"><a href="#I-Functional-Block-Breakdown" class="headerlink" title="I. Functional Block Breakdown"></a>I. Functional Block Breakdown</h2><p>Divided by functional blocks, friends can be divided into these three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Friends</strong></li>
<li><strong>Find Friends</strong></li>
<li><strong>Message Notifications</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The existing mobile game friends interfaces basically include these three parts. Depending on whether a certain game focuses on social interaction, the specific functions within each part will be different. Games that focus on social interaction often have more expanded functions, such as moments, message boards, social relationship recommendations, etc.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Block</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Existing Friends</strong></td>
<td align="left">Displays a list of current friends, allowing players to interact with them (e.g., chat, gift-giving, team up).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Find Friends</strong></td>
<td align="left">Provides methods to search for and add new friends (e.g., by username, nearby players, recommended players).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Message Notifications</strong></td>
<td align="left">Displays friend requests, system messages related to social interactions, and potentially mail (though mail is sometimes a separate system entirely).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The diagram above (not included here, as it requires a visual representation) shows the specific functions usually included in the friends block. It can be seen that there are quite a lot of function items included. Therefore, sorting and merging these function items is a prerequisite for rationally arranging the layout of the friends interface and making the overall hierarchy simple and clear.</p>
<h3 id="1-First-Level-Tab-Division"><a href="#1-First-Level-Tab-Division" class="headerlink" title="1. First-Level Tab Division"></a>1. First-Level Tab Division</h3><p>Usually, the three major functional blocks are used as the three first-level tabs of the friends section. If there are more expanded functions, then second-level tabs are added. The message notification part is special. Mail notification is a relatively independent part. Some games will put it together with the friends block as an independent tab, and some games will separate it. This can be determined according to the specific planning direction of the game, and it has little impact on the friends block itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F14864963-f950-42a9-83c7-5eacc0611caf.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;14864963-f950-42a9-83c7-5eacc0611caf.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="2-Friend-Request-List-Entry"><a href="#2-Friend-Request-List-Entry" class="headerlink" title="2. Friend Request List Entry"></a>2. Friend Request List Entry</h3><p>Although friend requests are message notifications, they are usually placed on the friends list page. This is because after a friend request is accepted, the friend will enter the friends list, which is logically related in terms of operation. Therefore, it is easier for players to understand that the request information is placed on the friends list page. And the importance of friend requests is relatively low, only requiring a prompt when there is request information. Usually, a button can be placed as an entry or used as a second-level tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2Fb89e2134-5060-4bc6-9b04-7a50332ee48b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;b89e2134-5060-4bc6-9b04-7a50332ee48b.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="3-Find-Friends-Functional-Block-Merging"><a href="#3-Find-Friends-Functional-Block-Merging" class="headerlink" title="3. Find Friends Functional Block Merging"></a>3. Find Friends Functional Block Merging</h3><p>In the “Find Friends” section, it can be seen that the search results, recommended friends, nearby people, and recent contacts all contain player lists and add friend operations, only differing in the specific information of the players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F11bdfe76-676c-4b99-91ee-da8d68de4c43.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;11bdfe76-676c-4b99-91ee-da8d68de4c43.jpg"></p>
<p>Therefore, we can usually combine two of the blocks for display. For example, the recommended friends list is displayed in the default state, and after a search, this area displays the search results list.</p>
<p>Using this method of switching display content in the same area can more effectively utilize interface space and simplify the interface hierarchy. If there are multiple functional blocks at the same time, tabs can be added to clarify the logic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F37009328-b4f3-4afb-9806-3c9eac71b870.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;37009328-b4f3-4afb-9806-3c9eac71b870.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="II-Prompt-Detail-Design"><a href="#II-Prompt-Detail-Design" class="headerlink" title="II. Prompt Detail Design"></a>II. Prompt Detail Design</h2><p>In order to make the player’s operation smooth, in interaction design, it is necessary to exhaustively list all possible operation situations that the player may encounter, otherwise some details may be overlooked. There are also some design details that need attention in the friends section.</p>
<h3 id="1-Nickname-Display"><a href="#1-Nickname-Display" class="headerlink" title="1. Nickname Display"></a>1. Nickname Display</h3><p>The nickname is the beginning of the player’s establishment of social relationships and identification of identity in the game. Therefore, the player’s nickname needs to be clearly displayed first in the friends list. Due to limited space in mobile games, the length of the nickname is usually limited. However, when designing the layout of list information, we still need to consider long nicknames and multiple languages. Simple icons or levels can be placed before the nickname, but free space needs to be reserved after the nickname. Usually, the nickname is on a separate line, and other information is on a new line. In this way, when the nicknames of various players are of different lengths, it will not affect the display of subsequent information and keep the layout clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F6e88d14c-41b1-405b-92ae-52815d46c7f4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;6e88d14c-41b1-405b-92ae-52815d46c7f4.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="2-Prompt-Information"><a href="#2-Prompt-Information" class="headerlink" title="2. Prompt Information"></a>2. Prompt Information</h3><p>Clear prompt information is the guarantee of smooth use by players, and there are also a series of prompt information that needs attention in the friends section.</p>
<p>For example, for nearby people, when the player turns off the positioning function, the list of nearby people is blank, and it needs to be prompted that the current positioning function is not turned on. In this case, we usually use positive guidance prompts such as “Turn on the positioning function to discover more players” with corresponding icons to guide players to use this function.</p>
<p>For another example, when the request list and search results are empty, it is necessary to pay attention to displaying corresponding prompt information such as “No friend requests” and “No corresponding friends found”. Without these prompts, a blank interface will make players wonder if it is stuck or if there is no content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190517%2F5b8cc86d-0b7c-443f-a771-9e33e55fdce1.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190517&#x2F;5b8cc86d-0b7c-443f-a771-9e33e55fdce1.jpg"></p>
<p>Clear interface hierarchy, functional block division, and detailed design details are aspects that we must consider when doing interaction design. This is the basic guarantee for satisfying usability and the premise for producing more innovative designs.</p>

<p>In previous work, we introduced lab testing. This issue mainly introduces another qualitative research that we often encounter in our daily work: public opinion research.</p>
<p>Academically speaking, public opinion is the sum of beliefs, attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed by a large number of people about various phenomena and problems in society. The large amount of information we encounter every day, such as Weibo, WeChat public accounts, and Tieba posts, all belong to public opinion. When these comments are related to our games, they are the objects of our research.</p>
<p>Compared with other research methods, public opinion can quickly and agilely obtain player feedback, and has great advantages in timeliness and cost.</p>

<p>Game public opinion generally focuses on hot spots, problem points, and spreading points, and will be emphasized according to the different stages of the game. The game testing period, launch period, and major update period are the risk periods of public opinion. The public opinion research work at this stage will mainly monitor channel ratings, monitor negative comments, monitor spread content, and mine highlights, etc. The purpose is to assist in maintaining the game’s reputation and subsequent product improvements. During daily operations, public opinion is relatively stable. Research focuses on monitoring game popularity, collecting activity feedback, and conducting UGC content analysis. The purpose is to help evaluate the effectiveness of activities and supplement data research in the game.</p>

<p>In actual work, the first step is to find the right channels. The channels we generally contact include forums (such as Tieba), distribution channels (such as the App Store), social platforms (such as Weibo), and video websites (Bilibili), etc. These channels have their own strengths in terms of group typicality, content relevance, external influence, and communication power, and can generally be screened according to the focus of public opinion research. For example, as an official channel, forums are an important channel for players to feedback game experience problems, and the game relevance is high, so you can mainly pay attention to forums when monitoring gameplay experience feedback on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The subsequent public opinion collation work is relatively simple and has a low threshold for getting started, but making a public opinion report that is useful to the product still requires in-depth understanding of the product and advanced training in public opinion analysis skills.</p>

    <title>Service Innovation Design: Agile Concepts and Planning</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190524_28584_815044/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190524/28584_815044.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “Service Innovation Design” course is jointly organized by NetEase Leihuo User Experience Center and the Department of Industrial Design of Zhejiang University. This course will last for three months and will be taught in 20 sessions. The course focuses on how to combine game products, offline game scenarios, and game users through service design, and cultivates students’ service design capabilities through theoretical explanations and case analysis. The final results will be exhibited at Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 22, the eleventh lecture of “Service Innovation Design”: Agile Concepts and Planning, was held as scheduled in the Department of Industrial Design of Zhejiang University. This course was taught by a PM from the Leihuo User Experience Center, mainly explaining in detail from three parts: basic concepts of agile development, how to build an “agile” team, and thinking and planning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the course, the teacher used “Deadline is the primary productive force” and “Game of Thrones’ anti-climatic ending” as examples to introduce the need for reasonable planning: Waterfall Development and Agile Development, which brought bursts of laughter from the students present. The course unfolded in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>The teacher first explained the basic concepts of Waterfall Development and Agile Development.</p>
<p>Waterfall Development, like a waterfall, has strict hierarchical steps. It is the most typical predictive method, strictly following the pre-planned steps of requirements analysis, design, coding, integration, testing, and maintenance. The advantages are clear and visualized progress, and simple progress management. The disadvantage is the extremely high cost of rework or change.</p>
<p>The teacher gave intuitive examples of industrial assembly lines and house construction to help students understand Waterfall Development.</p>
<p>One day, a pig and a chicken were walking down the road. The chicken said to the pig, “Hey, how about we start a restaurant together?” The pig looked back at the chicken and said, “Good idea, what do you want to name the restaurant?” The chicken thought for a moment and said, “How about ‘Ham and Eggs’?” “No way,” said the pig, “I’d be committed, but you’d only be involved.”</p>
<p>Then, the teacher used this joke to introduce Agile Development (Scrum). The pig team members are equivalent to the developers, and the chicken team members are equivalent to the users and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Agile development takes the evolution of user needs as the core, and adopts an iterative and gradual method for software development.</p>
<p>In order to help students more intuitively understand the difference between Waterfall Development and Agile Development, the teacher used “arranged marriage by parents” to describe the rigid and strict procedures of Waterfall Development, and “free love” to describe the flexible and free nature of Agile Development. Laughter of agreement came from the students again.</p>
<p>Advantages of Agile Development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid response to change:</strong> Prioritize what to do first, adapt to unexpected needs.</li>
<li><strong>Shorter delivery cycle:</strong> Continuously optimize and improve the product.</li>
<li><strong>Project transparency:</strong> Members and stakeholders can see the progress and problems of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Low trial and error cost:</strong> Even if a sprint has problems, the manpower and material resources wasted will not be much.</li>
<li><strong>High return on investment:</strong> Fast output and low cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>“2334, please remember these four numbers.” The teacher said to the students when explaining how to build an “agile” team.</p>
<p><strong>2 Tools:</strong></p>
<p>A Kanban board is generally a physical whiteboard, the purpose of which is to visualize and track iteration progress and collaborate. The Kanban board needs to display everyone’s tasks in the corresponding status (To Do&#x2F;Not checked out, Doing&#x2F;Checked out, Done), generally using sticky notes.</p>
<p>A burndown chart is a visual representation of the work that needs to be completed before the project is finished. A burndown chart has a Y-axis (work) and an X-axis (time). Ideally, the chart is a downward curve, and as the remaining work is completed, it “burns down” to zero.</p>
<p><strong>3 Roles:</strong></p>
<p>PO: Product Owner, generally a product manager, responsible for requirements analysis and organization, decomposition and acceptance of stories, maintenance of the Product Backlog, etc.</p>
<p>Scrum Master: Plays the role of a facilitator, responsible for hosting meetings, assisting team members in solving difficulties, resolving external interference with the team, and communicating with the outside world. The Master can be a dedicated person, or it can be a member of the team. In many teams, the PO also serves as the Master.</p>
<p>Dev Team: The entire development and testing team, including UI designers and all other relevant personnel.</p>
<p><strong>3 Artifacts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product Backlog: Product requirement pool</li>
<li>Sprint Backlog: The set of requirements to be developed this time</li>
<li>Potentially Shippable Product Increment: Deliverable results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4 Meetings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Requirements review meeting and iteration kickoff meeting. In this meeting, the following conclusions need to be reached:<ul>
<li>All members have a clear and concise iteration goal.</li>
<li>Clarify all requirements and technical implementation risks.</li>
<li>Evaluate the workload required and the personnel to be invested.</li>
<li>Determine all the final features and workload to be released. The Story needs to be broken down into Tasks, in units of hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Daily Scrum Planning:</strong> Daily stand-up meeting. As the name suggests, it is a meeting held standing up. Everyone forms a circle or a semicircle. There are two purposes for doing this, one is efficiency, and the other is to make it easier for all team members to see each other.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> Iteration review meeting. The main content of this meeting is for stakeholders and team members to show the functional increments of this iteration. It should be noted that unfinished functions are not displayed, and PPT is not needed. Record relevant feedback after the demonstration.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> Iteration review meeting. The main purpose of the meeting is to review the overall situation of this iteration. All members must participate, review the good things done in this iteration and the areas that need improvement, and propose improvement measures for these areas that need improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last part of thinking and planning, the teacher mainly explained the Mandala thinking method, mind mapping, and how to plan, and practiced the Mandala thinking method with the classification of <em>The 36 Stratagems</em>.</p>
<p>The Mandala thinking method is also known as the nine-square grid thinking method. After listening carefully to the teacher’s explanation, the students discussed in groups and showed their classification of the thirty-six stratagems.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, the teacher once again emphasized to the students the core of Agile Development: “Embrace change!” The students responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>

<h2 id="Single-Machine-ETL-Optimization"><a href="#Single-Machine-ETL-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Single-Machine ETL Optimization"></a>Single-Machine ETL Optimization</h2><h3 id="I-ETL-is-the-Core-Part-of-BI"><a href="#I-ETL-is-the-Core-Part-of-BI" class="headerlink" title="I. ETL is the Core Part of BI"></a>I. ETL is the Core Part of BI</h3><p><strong>What is ETL:</strong> Extract, Transform, Load. Faced with large amounts of data, how to load it efficiently?</p>
<p><strong>Core:</strong> The process from JSON in logs to the data warehouse should be as efficient as possible, and it is best not to rely on any irrelevant tool frameworks. Ideally, shorten the time from raw logs to the database as much as possible, and make it accurate.</p>
<p><strong>What is BI:</strong> Visualizing the data in the backend database? Making it look better?</p>
<p><strong>Core:</strong> Data visualization is an art. A good visualization solution can analyze data more conveniently and comprehensively; and it can also monitor exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>Main Process of ETL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Files:</strong> Raw player behavior logs.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Parse raw logs through regular expression matching, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Intermediate Files, Format Conversion:</strong> Parse raw logs to generate intermediate files, perform format conversion for easy subsequent processing.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled Data Loading:</strong> Taking Hive as an example, usually partition by day, load the data of the previous day into Hive every day. It can also be processed by hour, depending on the needs.</li>
<li>Usually, ETL takes at least 1&#x2F;3 of the time in the entire project. The quality of ETL determines the quality of the entire BI project.</li>
<li>The ETL process must be pure, otherwise the automation process will be interfered with by other factors. If ETL is not smooth, there is no need to look at the rest.</li>
<li>Data file storage should avoid a lot of copying and moving as much as possible. Moving calculations is cheap, moving data is expensive.</li>
<li>ETL code must also be modular and easy to expand. Adding a new requirement does not require changing the core code, only adding the corresponding functional requirements.</li>
<li>For log processing, it is necessary to make full use of computing resources and parallelize it because this process itself is a mutually independent process.</li>
<li>Data processing code must be rigorously tested and can be automatically monitored (including partition missing, field updates, and the addition of new logs).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="II-Single-Machine-Log-Processing"><a href="#II-Single-Machine-Log-Processing" class="headerlink" title="II. Single-Machine Log Processing"></a>II. Single-Machine Log Processing</h3><p>If you only have one machine, how can you achieve efficient ETL when processing log data? The processor of a computer system is often idle, especially since many current computer systems have good computing power, and most personal PCs are also multi-core processors. At the code level, we must let the computer exert its maximum computing power and keep the processor in a “busy state” at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, multiple processes are used for processing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Python uses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which serializes the threads in the process. That is, multi-core CPUs cannot actually achieve the purpose of parallel speedup. The use of multiple processes is not limited. In practical applications, multiple processes are recommended.</li>
<li>If the time required for each child process to execute is very short (execute +1 operation, etc.), there is no need to use multiple processes, because the startup and shutdown of processes will also consume resources.</li>
<li>Multi-processing is often used to handle CPU-intensive (scientific computing) requirements. If it is IO-intensive (file reading, web crawling, etc.), multi-threading can be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple code example:</p>
<p>#Psuedo-code representing the principles, not actual code<br>Write_process(Data_Queue):<br>	For Entry in Data_Source:<br>		Formatted_entry &#x3D; format(Entry)<br>		Data_Queue.put(Formatted_entry)<br>	Data_Queue.put(None)</p>
<p>Read_process(Data_Queue):<br>	While True:<br>		Entry &#x3D; Data_Queue.get()<br>        If Entry &#x3D;&#x3D; None:<br>			Break<br>		process(Entry)</p>
<p>Data_Queue &#x3D; Queue()<br>Write_p &#x3D; Process(Write_process, Data_Queue)<br>Read_p &#x3D; Process(Read_process, Data_Queue)</p>
<p>Write_p.start()<br>Read_p.start()<br>Write_p.join()<br>Read_p.join()<br><em>The write process writes to the queue, and the read process reads from the queue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):</strong> The execution of Python code is performed by the Python virtual machine, and access to the Python virtual machine is controlled by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This lock ensures that only one thread is running at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Important Modules:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Process module:</strong> Used to create child processes, which can realize the creation, startup, and shutdown of multiple processes.</li>
<li><strong>Queue module:</strong> Used to control process safety, the same as the Queue in threads.</li>
<li><strong>Pool module:</strong> Used to create and manage a process pool. This module can be used when there are many child processes and the number of child processes needs to be controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Lock module:</strong> When multiple processes need to access shared resources, Lock can be used to avoid access conflicts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>On UNIX platforms, when a process terminates, the process needs to be waited on by its parent process, otherwise the process becomes a zombie process. Therefore, it is necessary to call the <code>join()</code> method for each Process object (actually equivalent to <code>wait</code>). For multi-threading, since there is only one process, this necessity does not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Machine Multi-Process ETL Summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Data logs are usually placed on HDFS, and single-machine processing and copying to the local machine takes a lot of time. Avoid moving large amounts of data.</li>
<li>The number of processes needs to be dynamically set, and the appropriate number of processes should be set according to the size of the task.</li>
<li>In the face of large amounts of data, single-machine operations may become a bottleneck in efficiency. Increasing processes may not be very effective, and each step needs to be peeled off layer by layer.</li>
<li>Output of error logs and performance monitoring, which is convenient for efficiency optimization.</li>
<li>Of course, the biggest advantage of single-price processing of log data is stability and ease of debugging.</li>
<li>Configuration of database connection pool: Better utilize network resources, minimize the overhead of connection establishment and disconnection, and improve ETL performance.</li>
<li>Database grouping and sorting are better than ETL grouping and sorting. Hand over sorting and grouping problems to the database.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Core:</strong></p>
<p>For projects with a relatively small amount of data, single-machine processing of logs is completely sufficient. It is necessary to pay attention to the efficiency of data copying. The most important thing is stability and ease of debugging.</p>

    <title>Design and Specification of Basic Functional Interaction Motion Effects for Mobile Games</title>
    <url>/2019/05/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20190527_28584_815436/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190527/28584_815436.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, various apps and mobile games are increasingly pursuing an immersive interactive experience, and are no longer satisfied with the design of traditional static interfaces. At the same time, they are paying more and more attention to the design of motion effects in the interface. Many companies currently have their own interaction design specifications, such as Ant Design, etc., which have even packaged interaction and programs together for easy development and use. However, the design specifications for motion effects are relatively lacking. Designers often need to constantly adjust with technical colleagues to achieve the desired motion effect design. In the UX department, interaction prototyping engineers help interaction designers achieve the desired interaction design effects to complete rapid iterative output, making it easier to choose better solutions for in-depth advancement. Here, I will share some experience about the cooperation of interaction motion effect design.</p>
<p>The main function of motion effect design is to make the scene move through the movement of elements, so as to reduce user fatigue, increase information acquisition, increase the sense of ceremony, and trigger emotions. From a functional perspective, they can be divided into functional motion effects and expressive motion effects.</p>
<p>Functional motion effects are mainly used to express state changes, prompt users to pay attention, guide user operations, highlight information display, provide user feedback, and connect different information.</p>
<p>Expressive motion effects are mainly used to create experiences, such as obtaining achievements, specific transition effects, and creating a certain atmosphere. Expressive motion effects are often more complex, closer to animation or video, and generally appear less frequently, mainly in situations such as achieving achievements and obtaining special items. The rendering of the atmosphere is often greater than the embodiment of the function. The following mainly focuses on functional motion effects.</p>
<p><strong>Functional motion effects often have these characteristics:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Short</strong></p>
<p>How short? The unit of measurement for functional motion effects is generally milliseconds (ms). The duration of general functional motion effects will be controlled within 1s, and some agile feedback motion effects may only be about 300ms.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Concise</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of functional motion effects is very clear. At the same time, because of the short duration, the motion effects need to be concise, coherent, and without too many effects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Natural</strong></p>
<p>The motion effect should conform to the physical laws of the real world. It assists users in cognition and understanding of the interface, so it cannot increase the cost of understanding and cognition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By analogy, in fact, functional motion effects are very similar to elements such as line spacing and font in the interface to a certain extent. We use different font sizes and line spacing to distinguish different information levels, so that users can understand the structure and content of the article faster and easier. Functional motion effects also establish a cognitive connection between users and products through actions, making the operation and use of products more fluent and natural.</p>
<p>In interaction design, we have strict specifications for font size, line spacing, and alignment to improve the uniformity of the product. Similarly, motion effect design also needs a set of specifications. Imagine that when users click different buttons to open pop-up windows, the duration and motion curve of each motion effect are different. Users will be confused by this difference. When the number of such confusions increases, they will feel that the product is not smooth to use and have negative emotions. Basic functional motion effects often exist in every operation of the user, which will affect the experience of the entire product.</p>
<p>Based on this consideration, specifying a set of common basic motion effect specifications in the early stage of the product can lay a solid foundation for the product. The design process of motion effect specifications is as follows:</p>
<p>First, determine the personality of the product. Different games or apps have different personality characteristics. For example, <em>Anipop</em> will be more lively and cheerful, while <em>Identity V</em> will be darker and more terrifying. The corresponding feeling of motion effects is also different. If all the motion effects in a horror game are lively and exaggerated “DUANG DUANG” effects, it will destroy the carefully rendered horror atmosphere of the game, causing detachment and interrupting the user’s experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, find out the needs. The basic functional motion effect needs of a game are basically the same, such as click feedback, the appearance and closing of pop-up windows, the appearance and closing of tips, page switching, etc. The needs can be extracted by checking the game and reviewing the recordings to reduce errors and omissions. For example, different games will use different list presentation methods. The motion effects of strip lists and modular array lists will be different; and for array lists, sliding left and right to turn pages and sliding up and down to turn pages will also have different motion effects for the appearance of the list. This can better guide players to understand the page turning operation.</p>
<p>After that, design the requirements. At this stage, the designer cooperates with the interaction prototyping engineer to directly make the final motion effect with engineering software, and output code or engineering files to reduce the inability to fully restore the design expectations during development after only producing design documents and videos. At the same time, it can also greatly reduce the workload and burden of development. In the process of cooperation between designers and prototyping engineers, in order to further improve efficiency, designers can use visualization tools to independently design and iterate motion effects, and then connect with engineers to improve overall work efficiency and reduce the awkward situation of one person directing and one person operating. For example, when designing a motion curve, in order to make the motion effect more natural, the curve of each movement should be a easing curve. These curves can be adjusted by visually adjusting the anchor points (<a href="https://cubic-bezier.com/">https://cubic-bezier.com/</a>). The code can then be directly exported to the prototype engineer.</p>
<p>Finally, output the design specification document. Although the engineering file has been output through the prototyping engineer, the design specification document is still necessary in practical application. On the one hand, it can guide designers and engineers to reuse it in the application. On the other hand, the design specification should also be iterated with the advancement of the product. The specification document can be updated in real time to respond to all changes with a constant. The design specification document generally includes several aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application scenario of motion effect</strong></li>
<li><strong>Action decomposition (change value and time)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Basic code</strong></li>
<li><strong>Effect display (animation&#x2F;gif&#x2F;video)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prototype engineering file</strong></li>
</ul>

    <title>Introduction to Qualitative Research in Game Projects</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190530_28584_816105/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qualitative research is one of the commonly used methods in user research. Although, in games, we have a large amount of game logs to conduct various data analyses and obtain more accurate results, data is often only a result and an appearance. We are more interested in knowing the underlying reasons behind the data, that is, why such data results are produced.</p>
<p>Telephone interviews, in-depth interviews, street intercepts, and focus groups are the four qualitative research methods we commonly use.</p>
<h2 id="Telephone-Interviews"><a href="#Telephone-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="Telephone Interviews"></a>Telephone Interviews</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Faa9eb44a-e286-47eb-89d9-94d6fe317b22.jpg/size/" alt="Telephone Interview"></p>
<p><em>(Image from the Internet)</em></p>
<p>Generally, for products that already have a certain user base, such as products that have been launched or are being tested, the telephone interview method can be used for some special research topics. The advantage of this method is that there is no venue restriction, and the cost of acquiring players is relatively low. However, the disadvantage is that it is impossible to observe the players’ real game experience, and it is necessary to carefully distinguish the authenticity of the players’ feedback.</p>
<h2 id="In-depth-Interviews"><a href="#In-depth-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="In-depth Interviews"></a>In-depth Interviews</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fda149520-d2b0-4fa5-b140-d57fb91d469b.jpg/size/" alt="In-depth Interview"></p>
<p>In-depth interviews are generally combined with laboratory tests or other tests. Generally, we invite players to participate in designated venues and pay a certain amount of compensation. This type of interview, first of all, has certain requirements for the players themselves, such as game experience, occupation and other demographic information; secondly, it has high requirements for time and venue, because the test not only needs to provide players with a comfortable environment, but may also involve the participation of multiple parties such as products, user researchers, and players, so coordination is required. Because in-depth interviews provide players with compensation, players are more willing to cooperate, but relatively, the feedback will be more positive. Therefore, when conducting in-depth interviews, do not over-interpret players’ ratings of products.</p>
<h2 id="Street-Intercepts"><a href="#Street-Intercepts" class="headerlink" title="Street Intercepts"></a>Street Intercepts</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fed000c6a-618c-4cdd-abc1-2b682fc1d0f4.jpg/size/" alt="Street Intercept"></p>
<p>Suitable for product evaluation in the demo period. Generally, according to certain game experience, occupation and other demographic information, players are directly invited on the street to watch game videos or try them out, and give certain feedback. Unlike in-depth interviews, this street research method generally does not provide players with compensation, or players do not know in advance that they can receive compensation. Therefore, players’ behavior is more real and closer to market performance. However, because there are many uncontrollable factors in external testing, this method also has disadvantages: the experience interview time is generally short, and it is difficult to find target players, like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<h2 id="Focus-Groups"><a href="#Focus-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Focus Groups"></a>Focus Groups</h2><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190530%2Fcdae42f1-768e-4933-8dde-83bb89d95825.jpg/size/" alt="Focus Group"></p>
<p>Generally, a small-scale symposium is used to select a group of relatively “similar” players, and the host conducts interviews in an unstructured or semi-structured manner. It is generally used to understand the attitude of a specific group of players towards a certain gameplay or concept. Through interaction and discussion with each other, players can often stimulate more new ideas and viewpoints. However, it should be noted that there may be “opinion leaders” or relatively introverted players among the players, so there are higher requirements for the host’s ability to control the scene.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction to the four qualitative research methods we commonly use in the user research process. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the actual work process, it is also necessary to choose the appropriate method according to specific needs.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-pandas"><a href="#What-is-pandas" class="headerlink" title="What is pandas?"></a>What is pandas?</h2><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F01118837-75f2-47d1-bd9c-2275d95666bb.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;01118837-75f2-47d1-bd9c-2275d95666bb.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="pandas-Concept-Introduction"><a href="#pandas-Concept-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="pandas Concept Introduction"></a>pandas Concept Introduction</h3><p>Let’s briefly introduce pandas. pandas is a tool based on NumPy (which can be used to store and process large matrices), providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. As the official documentation states, many potential pandas users have some knowledge of SQL, so this article aims to compare pandas with common SQL usage methods.</p>
<p>The official documentation states that new features in pandas will only support Python 3 after January of this year, so this article will use Python 3 for examples. The usage in Python 2 is basically the same.</p>
<h3 id="pandas-Structured-Data-Classification"><a href="#pandas-Structured-Data-Classification" class="headerlink" title="pandas Structured Data Classification"></a>pandas Structured Data Classification</h3><p>Before we start, let’s briefly understand the data structures of pandas. pandas mainly has three types of data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Series:</strong> A 1-dimensional sequence, which can be regarded as a DataFrame without column names and with only one column.</li>
<li><strong>DataFrame:</strong> Multi-column 2-dimensional structured data, which can be regarded as a container for Series.</li>
<li><strong>Panel:</strong> 3-dimensional structured data, which can be regarded as a container for DataFrame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among them, DataFrame is more common and can be imagined as the form of an Excel table. It can be generated by reading multiple types of text such as .csv, .xlsx, and JSON data, or it can be generated through objects. This article will focus on the use of DataFrame.</p>
<h3 id="Using-pandas-to-Implement-Basic-SQL-Functions"><a href="#Using-pandas-to-Implement-Basic-SQL-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Using pandas to Implement Basic SQL Functions"></a>Using pandas to Implement Basic SQL Functions</h3><p>We use the pandas test database <code>tips</code> and import it into a DataFrame. The data format is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F575ec9a3-b04c-424c-aa51-e00ced4b3a87.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;575ec9a3-b04c-424c-aa51-e00ced4b3a87.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>SELECT</strong></p>
<p>pandas is more flexible in data selection. To select the first two columns of data, the corresponding SQL is:<br>sql<br>select total_bill, tip from tips;</p>
<p>Using pandas, you can filter data based on rows and columns. The simplest way to select rows&#x2F;columns is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2Fd332727d-97ad-4d34-b82b-7c044d42b06e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;d332727d-97ad-4d34-b82b-7c044d42b06e.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that there are two square brackets here. pandas also supports row selection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F7b82e6c2-7970-4ff5-9eb0-c19d68e62103.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;7b82e6c2-7970-4ff5-9eb0-c19d68e62103.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the row numbers here start from 0 by default, and the usage here is similar to list slicing.  Can we locate certain rows and columns? Of course, we can. Here we need to use the <code>loc</code> or <code>iloc</code> methods, as shown below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F8fa0bcc3-9e18-46d8-b899-4248a42cb833.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;8fa0bcc3-9e18-46d8-b899-4248a42cb833.jpg"></p>
<p>All four methods can achieve the results in the figure.  Of course, there is a more convenient method, which is to use the <code>ix</code> method. However, the official documentation does not recommend using this method now. <code>loc</code> and <code>iloc</code> are based on index and position, respectively, which can be distinguished by the representation of columns in the figure. One uses the column name, and the other uses the position of the column. This fully reflects the flexibility and convenience of pandas, which can use multiple methods to retrieve data by row and column.  There are also <code>at</code> and <code>iat</code> methods to locate the value of a certain row and column.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE</strong></p>
<p>The main filtering method in pandas is based on <code>df[df[column] boolean expr]</code>, such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2Fdcf7d310-4ece-4a5f-b650-a26577292c48.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;dcf7d310-4ece-4a5f-b650-a26577292c48.jpg"></p>
<p>The corresponding SQL is <code>select * from tips where sex=&#39;Male&#39; limit 5</code>. If there are conditions such as <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> in the <code>where</code> filtering condition, you can use <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> to add conditions.  As shown in the figure, add filtering conditions and select two columns:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F07514ffe-2dc9-477e-8d26-8bc504b83d47.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;07514ffe-2dc9-477e-8d26-8bc504b83d47.jpg"></p>
<p>There are also methods such as <code>notna()</code> and <code>isna()</code> to assist in judgment, to determine whether it is empty. At the same time, you can also determine how many rows of data meet the conditions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F409096bd-660c-49dc-a1cf-306e4ce36c3a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;409096bd-660c-49dc-a1cf-306e4ce36c3a.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>GROUP BY</strong></p>
<p>In pandas, <code>group</code> is generally used with aggregation functions, such as <code>avg()</code>, <code>count()</code>, etc. There are not many supported methods in this area, but they can basically meet daily needs.</p>
<p>The corresponding SQL is <code>select sex, count(*) from tips group by sex</code>. Here we need to look at the corresponding data volume according to gender. Using pandas will be very concise:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F6b64f330-dd54-4561-b2c1-220e992b1da2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;6b64f330-dd54-4561-b2c1-220e992b1da2.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that there is another method called <code>count()</code> method. The <code>count()</code> method cannot be used here because the <code>count()</code> method counts the columns. For the calculation of multiple aggregated values, such as the SQL:<br>sql<br>select sex, max(tip), max(size) from tips group by sex</p>
<p>In pandas, you can use the <code>agg()</code> function with a dictionary configuration to achieve the goal:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F8d6afe9e-57dc-4ae6-b910-f8fb6ed118c2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;8d6afe9e-57dc-4ae6-b910-f8fb6ed118c2.jpg"></p>
<p>If there is a count, there is a distinct count. Here you can use a similar method to obtain the gender situation contained in each tip according to the tip:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F2210bebe-7d0a-475a-90bb-1ea2bbe28ff2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;2210bebe-7d0a-475a-90bb-1ea2bbe28ff2.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>DISTINCT</strong></p>
<p>We mentioned distinct count above, so let’s take a look at distinct, which is also a very frequently used function in SQL. In pandas, we can also find a corresponding method, <code>drop_duplicates()</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to remove duplicates from <code>tip</code>, you can use it like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F4039fca2-09f3-40a2-99bb-61290cd8e1bc.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;4039fca2-09f3-40a2-99bb-61290cd8e1bc.jpg"></p>
<p>You can see the row numbers in front, 0 and 56. This is the role of <code>keep</code> in the method. <code>keep</code> can be set to <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, and <code>False</code>, which means to keep the first, last, and delete all duplicates, respectively. The effect is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F27d09520-5365-4565-9f56-7655312b4357.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;27d09520-5365-4565-9f56-7655312b4357.jpg"></p>
<p><code>inplace</code> can be <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, default is <code>False</code>, which means to return a new DataFrame or return the original DataFrame after removing duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>JOIN</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of SQL, we have to mention <code>join</code>. When performing data association, <code>join</code> can play a huge role. I won’t go into the difference between various types of <code>join</code> here. There are many vivid examples online. So what is the corresponding method in pandas? Is there a <code>join</code> method? Yes, there is, but this method is based on the <code>index</code>, which is the row number, so we generally use the second method, the <code>merge</code> method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2Fb0f8e202-e2fa-4828-859e-c6b8617e2b8b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;b0f8e202-e2fa-4828-859e-c6b8617e2b8b.jpg"></p>
<p>You can see that the usage is very close to the <code>join</code> in our SQL. You only need to use a list to represent the columns to be joined, and you can use multiple dimensions as association items.</p>
<p><strong>ORDER</strong></p>
<p>The last more commonly used one is sorting. Similarly, the usage is also very flexible and very similar to SQL. As shown in the figure, it is to sort <code>sex</code> and <code>size</code>, where <code>sex</code> is in descending order and <code>size</code> is in ascending order. Here, you only need to use the list method to sort multiple columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190531%2F647aceff-78fb-4d56-b389-873fae7317f2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190531&#x2F;647aceff-78fb-4d56-b389-873fae7317f2.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>We have learned about the flexibility and power of pandas by corresponding to the high-frequency keywords of SQL. Of course, the capabilities of pandas are definitely not limited to this. When processing medium-sized data, if you can skillfully optimize the use of pandas, it will be very helpful to our work. After all, this is using a script. In addition to what SQL can do, there are more abundant means to process and obtain the data we want.</p>

    <title>Let&#39;s Talk About Design Communication - IXDC 2018 Summary Sharing (Part 2)</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190606_28584_816989/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190606/28584_816989.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last sharing session, I introduced the sharing by Li Yue, a senior user experience designer at Didi CDX, “Making Good Use of the [Experience + Data Dual-Drive Model] to Deduce Good Design”, which mainly elaborated on the important role of the 5 Whys method of design inquiry in excavating the essential needs of the product or planning party at the initial stage of design. In this sharing, I will talk about how design communication should be carried out in the design process based on another IXDC workshop.</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-Talk-About-Design-Communication"><a href="#Let’s-Talk-About-Design-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Talk About Design Communication"></a>Let’s Talk About Design Communication</h2><p>This design communication workshop was prepared by Dhaval Joshi, a senior product manager at Tencent, and Suxi Chen, an interaction designer. It mainly derives content about design communication through the problems encountered in their VR live broadcast design process. I think the main gain is how to carry out work in unknown field design, and secondly, to learn how to organize feedback from different states in the design process.</p>
<p>Dhaval Joshi started with V+ live broadcast. V Society is one of the earlier companies to use VR and other technologies to do game e-sports, and it performed well in the Dota2 international competition. Inspired by this, Tencent also hopes to provide a new immersive experience for its LOL fans and users through the mobile VR e-sports live broadcast experience, to create new ways to reach fans and provide new channels to attract users.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, in the traditional development process, design, development, and testing cooperate with each other through a linear process to complete the requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F0a5da94a-5419-4105-afe1-404506913bb4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;0a5da94a-5419-4105-afe1-404506913bb4.jpg"></p>
<p>However, when targeting VR, a new form of interaction, they suddenly found that everyone did not know how to achieve the best performance of this new media, and their design performance and communication were not easily understood by others, because product managers and programmers did not have a unified understanding of VR performance.</p>
<p>Faced with VR, a new medium, they first started by positioning the characteristics of VR itself. We know that in real life, everyone watches games on the sidelines of the stadium (as shown in the figure below), facing a large space. What VR virtual reality can bring us is to reconstruct this space, so that everyone can be immersed in the scene without leaving home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2Fd55929aa-f29e-4251-8235-6bdb2ea13d3b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;d55929aa-f29e-4251-8235-6bdb2ea13d3b.jpg"></p>
<p>Then, since mobile VR on mobile platforms generally adopts a head-mounted technology form, the operation will not adopt the form of touch screen. Therefore, there are two key points in VR design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F44c1b785-ff03-4a56-ba31-c2612468e3d9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;44c1b785-ff03-4a56-ba31-c2612468e3d9.jpg"></p>
<p>Therefore, for this kind of three-dimensional space design, they creatively adopted a new way of expression to facilitate communication. as the picture shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2Fdf32eafa-6647-4ce3-9371-8d2f4347239f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;df32eafa-6647-4ce3-9371-8d2f4347239f.jpg"></p>
<p>Then, use low-fidelity to directly let the program quickly implement an interactive version for testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F13fd0a37-7a0f-4e25-97aa-e993cc9b3c51.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;13fd0a37-7a0f-4e25-97aa-e993cc9b3c51.jpg"></p>
<p>Through this case, we can clearly see how important simulation is in design communication. Only when the participants understand and synchronize the information between each other can they get what the designer wants in the design implementation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F7fb47033-f68a-4663-8e47-d13ca3bba8d9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;7fb47033-f68a-4663-8e47-d13ca3bba8d9.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Translation-Model"><a href="#Translation-Model" class="headerlink" title="Translation Model"></a>Translation Model</h2><p>Another gain for me is about the translation model. Tencent’s designers use it to translate the interaction form and scene they set into a language that the program can easily understand. But I personally think that this is actually very suitable for complex systems like games to sort out various states and feedback. As shown in the figure below, the translation model is to number each element after completing the basic interaction framework, and then sort out the feedback of all other elements after triggering one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190606%2F7ea26a79-effb-4e2d-96ff-5ebf4ae4c3da.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190606&#x2F;7ea26a79-effb-4e2d-96ff-5ebf4ae4c3da.jpg"></p>
<p>Through this operation, it can ensure that the designer does not miss the state when outputting content to the greatest extent, and can enrich the performance of the interface and think of ideas that were not thought of during previous designs. Of course, this method also has disadvantages. If the interface is particularly complex, the efficiency will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the number of compressed element numbers should also be considered.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>To review, design communication is an indispensable and important part of design communication. In the design process, how to make product managers, developers and other relevant personnel understand the design content and clarify the design goals is the key problem to be solved by design communication. Simulation is a good way. Through simulation, developers and product managers can actually participate in and experience the design, and then it is easier to understand the design ideas and unify ideas.</p>
<p>Designers, especially interaction designers, often pay more attention to the various states of design. Through the translation model, it is more convenient for designers to sort out feedback and states in the later stage to prevent omissions.</p>

    <title>[UE Sharing] How to Become an Interview Master (Part 1)</title>
    <url>/2019/06/03/netease-ux-articles/news_20190610_28584_817347/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190610/28584_817347.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous articles, we introduced many qualitative research methods. So, do you know what we spend 50% of our time doing in these qualitative studies?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, half of our time is actually spent interviewing (chatting) with players.</p>
<p>Many people may think that interviewing is actually just chatting. As long as you establish a good relationship with the player at the beginning and communicate with them in a sincere and friendly manner, the player will open up and give you all their feelings and opinions. Or maybe, it’s thought that being outgoing, cheerful, and talkative are the conditions for a successful interview.</p>
<p>But in our actual work, interviews are far from being successful based solely on creating a good atmosphere or the interviewer’s personal social skills. Everyone needs to understand that sometimes interviewees don’t express themselves much, not because they are unwilling to express themselves, but because the interviewee’s own ability to express themselves is actually limited. Sometimes, the interviewee may not even know where the problem lies. For example, we often ask players, “Why don’t you play this game anymore?” We may hope that players can make a comprehensive analysis from aspects such as graphics, gameplay, and monetization. But ask yourself, if you suddenly receive such an interview call one day, can you really figure out why you don’t want to play this game? Therefore, when we conduct interviews, we actually rely heavily on the interviewer’s own interview skills to dig out the player’s problems, help the player figure out the problems, and express them clearly.</p>
<p>The player you imagine:</p>
<p>[Image of a detailed and expressive individual]</p>
<p>The actual player, doing the Buddhist “three”:</p>
<p>[Image of a person saying “I don’t know,” “It’s okay,” and “Whatever”]</p>
<p>So how can you become an interview master?</p>
<p>[Image of a person meditating]</p>
<p>To become an interview master, we need to break through 3 levels of mastery</p>
<p><strong>The First Level of Cultivation: Be a Good Mouthpiece for Players</strong></p>
<p>Although we have always emphasized that user researchers are not just mouthpieces for players, in the initial stage of becoming an interview master, you must first learn how to be a good mouthpiece.</p>
<p>So how do you become a good mouthpiece for players? There is a keyword here, which is “disassemble” (拆 - chāi)</p>
<p>[Image of拆]</p>
<p>First of all, we need to clarify our purpose. A large part of the content of our interviews is actually to understand what problems players have encountered. The problems here, of course, refer to the problems of the product itself. So what we really need to get is feedback from players on what problems the product itself has.</p>
<p>Here, many beginner interviewers are often easily fooled by players, that is, they confuse the product’s problems with the player’s experience problems. Many times, players seem to be talking about the product’s problems, but they are actually just expressing their own feelings and not talking about the problems of the product itself.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the following question: “I feel that the… emmm… hit feedback of this game is not very good”</p>
<p>[Image showing concern and confusion at a screen]</p>
<p>What is hit feedback? In games, hit feedback refers to a kind of simulated real fighting feeling composed of attack feedback and hit feedback during the character’s fighting process. This defines whether a game’s combat feels impactful. Here, hit feedback is actually a player’s feeling.</p>
<p>[Image of hand with a lightbulb]</p>
<p>But just knowing that the hit feedback is not good, we still don’t know where the product’s problem lies. Why? Because hit feedback is actually composed of many parts. Hit feedback can first be divided into two aspects: attack process and hit performance. The attack process includes attack actions, attack special effects, hit confirmation, combo design, etc. Hit actions also include hit special effects, hit actions, etc. So the question is, the player says the hit feedback is not good. Is it because the attack action design is not real enough, or the hit action performance is not obvious? Which part should the designer modify to improve the hit feedback of this game? We cannot get the answer from the feedback of the above player.</p>
<p>[Image of a chart breaking down a character action’s components]</p>
<p>So if you encounter a player who says “the hit feedback is not good”, our interview on this issue is not over. The “depth” of in-depth interviews lies in “specificity” and “follow-up questions”</p>
<p>How to achieve “specificity”? Here we need a standard. A complete question should include these parts, 5W2H. Summarized, it can also be called a three-part answer: “problem” + “attitude” + “expectation”. The best feedback on a question should include these 3 parts. You can use this standard to check whether the player’s feedback on this issue is complete.</p>
<p>[Image of 5W2H Framework]</p>
<p>The second point, “follow-up questions”. As mentioned earlier, the player’s ability to express and their understanding of the problem are not as good as we think. Sometimes, no matter how we follow up (pressure), the player can only say that the hit feedback is not good, but they can’t say why. At this time, the interviewer needs to have the above table (framework) in mind. The interviewer can gradually locate the specific problem point with the player within this framework.</p>
<p>[Image of gears working together]</p>
<p>For example, for the problem of poor hit feedback, we can first confirm with the player whether it is some action performance of the attack process that is not obvious, or the performance of the other party being hit is not obvious. If the player says that the performance of being hit is not obvious, then we will confirm whether the hit action is not real enough, the special effects performance is not strong enough, or the sound effects are not good enough. Follow this framework to determine the location of the problem step by step. This is a common method of gradually restoring the player’s feedback attitude to the game design.</p>
<p>[Image of a funnel going from high level view, to specifics]</p>
<p>The essence of this method is to think about the player’s problems within a framework. So for a professional interview master, what is needed is a framework for disassembling various game problems. This requires us to often do some game disassembly summaries and accumulations at ordinary times. For example, when a gameplay is not fun, how can we disassemble it into the game’s design? When a game’s art is reported as not good, how can we disassemble it into various details?</p>
<p>Let’s review. Today we talked about the first level of becoming an interview master, which is to be a good mouthpiece for players</p>
<p>So how do you become a good mouthpiece for players? The keyword is “disassemble”</p>
<p>Why do we need to disassemble? Because the player’s ability to express and analyze problems is not as good as we think</p>
<p>We need to guide the player step by step to discover the location of the problem within a framework, and gradually restore the player’s feedback attitude to the game design</p>
<p>How can we accumulate these frameworks? We need to play games more often, or when we find problems, we should do more game disassembly summaries and accumulations</p>
<p>So, as I just said, there are three levels to becoming an interview master. What about the other two?</p>
<p>To be continued, so stay tuned…</p>

    <title>Thoughts on Game Interaction Design in the &quot;Hook Model&quot;</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190612_28584_817683/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you often say to your friends in daily games, “Just 20 more minutes” or “Just one more round”? This kind of scenario where it’s hard to let go in the game is actually a common manifestation of our investment in the game, and even indicates that we may be “addicted” to the game. So today, let’s talk about the “Hook Model” theory that makes us addicted to games from the perspective of game interaction designers.</p>
<p>The “Hook Model” is a product design method proposed by Nir Eyal in <em>Hooked</em> that can engage users and gradually make them dependent. It mainly includes four steps: trigger, action, reward, and investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F0809a9a0-4a3b-42e8-b4eb-98185f93473a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;0809a9a0-4a3b-42e8-b4eb-98185f93473a.jpg"></p>
<p>These four steps are a cyclical process. The more users are immersed in this cycle, the stronger the attraction of your product design. Conversely, when users stop this cycle, as a designer, you need to consider at which stage the user encountered a problem, why it did not meet the user’s expectations, and how to make the product design closely connected with the user’s behavior habits and emotional state.</p>
<h2 id="Trigger"><a href="#Trigger" class="headerlink" title="Trigger"></a>Trigger</h2><p>Everything is difficult at the beginning. The first step is to trigger the user to be motivated to use your product, which is called a trigger. As the first step in habit formation, triggers need to use pain points and needs to make users have expectations and attention. Therefore, as a designer, you need to clearly convey the user’s needs and desired goals to the user, arouse the user’s sense of participation. When designing, you not only need to display the user’s short-term goals, but also the display of long-term goals is extremely important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Fe7542f31-82a1-47dc-ada3-7d2ad0dbe702.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;e7542f31-82a1-47dc-ada3-7d2ad0dbe702.jpg"></p>
<p>In <em>Shenmu</em> (神都夜行录), the sign-in interface displays the special reward for the 10th day of sign-in - Jade Bi - independently. While giving users a higher goal, it also reminds users and stimulates them to log in again every time they sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F251f14b9-dfdf-4070-a51c-cfaeebaada7c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;251f14b9-dfdf-4070-a51c-cfaeebaada7c.jpg"></p>
<p>When the goal is too long-term to be achieved quickly, the user will not see the goal feedback at the beginning, so after a long time, they will become bored, which reduces the motivation to open the product. The sign-in goal in <em>Onmyoji</em> is relatively long-term, but when designing, the long-term goal is broken down into multiple more achievable phased small goals, which can better stimulate user motivation.</p>
<h2 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h2><p>After the previous stage triggered the user, in this stage we need the user to take effective action. The difficulty of taking action will directly affect the possibility of the user continuing the game. Therefore, it is necessary to meet the user’s psychological expectations, ensure that the core behavior entry is obvious, and high-frequency behavior operations are easy to implement. This stage requires us to sort out the user’s usage path, delete unnecessary operations, reduce the user’s action cost, and make the product design efficient and easy to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F504e7372-4b6e-48bb-b22a-a439a2c76da5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;504e7372-4b6e-48bb-b22a-a439a2c76da5.jpg"></p>
<p>The main task prompt of <em>Idol Company</em> (拜托了经纪人) is permanently displayed on the main interface in a differentiated and prominent form. When you click to open the task details, you can click to directly jump to the corresponding function interface for operation. For example, you can directly enter a certain story chapter, or you can jump to the card development interface, etc., greatly reducing the user’s operation path and improving the user’s operation efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F623d8e9d-9ebc-4c5e-8690-18a49e26d016.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;623d8e9d-9ebc-4c5e-8690-18a49e26d016.jpg"></p>
<p>Dungeon-type games are usually repetitive and mechanical gameplay, mainly reflected in the scene, tasks, and operations. When designing, it is necessary to provide automated functions to reduce repetitive interfaces and save user operation time. For example, in <em>Samurai Shodown</em>, when the dungeon ends, in the area that is easy to operate on the horizontal screen, the function of challenging again is provided, reducing the threshold of action to improve the efficiency of clearing dungeons.</p>
<h2 id="Reward"><a href="#Reward" class="headerlink" title="Reward"></a>Reward</h2><p>In addition to the ease of use of the product, the product must also be able to provide a variety of potential incentives to maintain the user’s interest, so that the user’s behavioral motivation can be satisfied, and the user’s desire to continue using it can be increased. When designing, it is necessary to grasp the user’s behavioral needs, give timely prompts and feedback, and let the user’s behavior have rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Fe1471130-9baa-4ab0-93f1-4df2238384a2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;e1471130-9baa-4ab0-93f1-4df2238384a2.jpg"></p>
<p>In the ranking settlement of <em>QQ Speed</em>, the change in rank points is used to bring a sense of achievement to the user, and it also shows the change in the ranking of the user’s current rank points among the national users, which can further stimulate the user’s comparison psychology, so as to continuously carry out the ranking gameplay to surpass others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F12e2f833-1368-4a97-8d4b-7ab80b880708.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;12e2f833-1368-4a97-8d4b-7ab80b880708.jpg"></p>
<p>Social showing off is also one of the driving user behavior methods in rewards. In the settlement interface of <em>Peacekeeper Elite</em>, in addition to strengthening the display of MVP user information, it also shows the achievements of the team users in the current game, so that users can use the achievements obtained as a capital to show off to other users and gain recognition, regardless of whether their performance is the most prominent in this game.</p>
<h2 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h2><p>Investment refers to the time, energy, money, etc. that users invest in the product. In order to make users have psychological expectations and take action, it is necessary to strengthen the user’s cognition that the more investment, the better the service, and cultivate users to become loyal users. When designing, it is necessary to guide users to use the product again, and encourage users to continue to invest in the product to improve stickiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2Ff9c67c1c-b8d6-4dc7-a58e-c883d6a7c71a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;f9c67c1c-b8d6-4dc7-a58e-c883d6a7c71a.jpg"></p>
<p>Whether it is a mobile game or an end game, the in-game mall and coupons are just needs of users. When <em>Honor of Kings</em> induces consumption and recharge, it insights into the user’s consumption tendency psychology and shows the difference in the recharge stage, so that users can clearly continue to recharge. It can bring about changes in the noble level and have more game privileges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190612%2F976ea91b-8787-46cf-85b4-3e31eb71fe93.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190612&#x2F;976ea91b-8787-46cf-85b4-3e31eb71fe93.jpg"></p>
<p>Users tend to overestimate the results of their labor input, so the more input, the more it can increase the user’s sense of exclusivity and self-identity. When <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em> (lit. “Meeting Nishuihan”) ends the travel function, it prompts the rewards that can be obtained and the rewards that have not yet been obtained, accurately showing the gap brought about by different investments, and encouraging users to increase investment time to bring more rewards.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The “Hook Model” guides users to participate through goals, reduces user payment behavior, and gives feedback after each payment, and finally improves product stickiness through user payment. When designing, it is necessary to grasp the user’s pain points, plan the user’s behavior path, give users a sense of psychological satisfaction, and then continue to stimulate users to cycle investment, so that users are addicted to it will naturally be a matter of course.</p>

<p>Last time we introduced the interview method in qualitative research. This time we will introduce the questionnaire survey in quantitative research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fb2e17500-32ee-42b5-9f3a-99c6a33863b1.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;b2e17500-32ee-42b5-9f3a-99c6a33863b1.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What is a questionnaire and what kind of information can it provide?</strong></p>
<p>A questionnaire is a common quantitative research tool in social science research. It is highly self-reported and supports the rapid collection of large-sample data. Questionnaires can provide feedback on some of the respondents’ behavioral patterns (e.g., player type&#x2F;daily game frequency), subjective feelings and attitudes (satisfaction with the game&#x2F;willingness to recommend), and the scale&#x2F;extent of feedback problems (e.g., the main problem reported by players is XXX, accounting for XX%). However, questionnaires can do little to understand the reasons behind the respondents’ behaviors and attitudes, and need to be combined with further qualitative research methods.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the questionnaire method?</strong></p>
<p>Advantages: It can quickly collect large-sample data at a lower cost, and the results can be quantitatively compared.</p>
<p>For example, by placing a game satisfaction questionnaire in the game, at least thousands of sample feedback can be collected in a short time to obtain satisfaction scores for longitudinal and horizontal comparison; while if interviews, intercepts, and other forms are used, it will consume a lot of manpower and time.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: The quality of questionnaire data will be affected by various factors such as the way of questioning, the attitude of the respondents, and the sensitivity of the questions, and the authenticity of the answers will be compromised. Moreover, the feedback content is often not deep enough, and is more biased towards phenomenon description.</p>
<p>Taking game satisfaction as an example again, the questionnaire can give us a general understanding of the satisfaction of large-sample players, but there are also the following problems: 1. Some players fill in the questionnaire sloppily and directly check the first option, without actually providing feedback on their true satisfaction. 2. We only get the players’ satisfaction scores, and do not know the reasons why high&#x2F;low-scoring players gave the scores.</p>
<p><strong>Application scenarios of questionnaire method in game user research</strong></p>
<p>Questionnaires are widely used and basically run through all stages of game research. Here are a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to understand the game type preferences of a specific group of people (such as players of a certain game&#x2F;fans of a certain IP): Distribute questionnaires in QQ groups, forums and other places where the target population gathers.</li>
<li>During the game testing period, it is necessary to introduce players with specific attributes: Use online questionnaires&#x2F;telephone questionnaires on the reservation website to collect game experience and demographic information, and then screen out the required players.</li>
<li>During the game testing period, it is necessary to understand the players’ satisfaction with the game, pain points, etc.: Distribute questionnaires in the game, and use single-choice, multiple-choice, free-form and other forms of questions to collect player feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips for questionnaire research</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Questionnaire design should be carried out around the research purpose to ensure that the data comes from the target population.</strong></p>
<p>Before designing, it is necessary to communicate the needs well and clarify the purpose of the questionnaire to ensure that the results of the questionnaire meet the research needs. This also helps to control the number of questions. In addition, the first draft of the questionnaire can be written in the form of Excel, Xmind, etc., which is convenient for quick modification and clarification of ideas, and does not need to directly produce a fillable electronic questionnaire. In addition, there are certain risks in distributing questionnaires in the name of the company, and it is necessary to check repeatedly and from multiple parties when distributing.</p>
<p><strong>2. In scenarios with a large sample size, use closed-ended questions (single-choice, multiple-choice, scale) instead of open-ended free-form questions.</strong></p>
<p>Free-form questions with large samples often mean collecting a long string of text data that is difficult to quantify uniformly and has a huge workload of coding. For the convenience of data analysis and the vertical and horizontal comparison of results, closed-ended questions should be used as much as possible. The options for closed-ended questions can be determined through runs, public opinion, feedback from previous versions, and communication with planners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa38be4fd-db98-4354-bcd4-0a928f7010d4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a38be4fd-db98-4354-bcd4-0a928f7010d4.jpg"></p>
<p>(Free-form results are often bizarre…)</p>
<p><strong>3. In terms of question design, it is necessary to make the questions easy to understand and answer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the questionnaire logically smooth and reduce the cognitive burden on players. Put questions from the same module together, or directly use matrix questions.</li>
<li>Avoid using jargon, and make questions and options easy to understand or add annotations:<ul>
<li>Counter-example: What kind of fun do you value more in the process of experiencing ARPG games? [Players may not understand what an ARPG game is, or it may be different from UE’s understanding of ARPG]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A single question should only examine one issue, and should not involve multiple contents:<ul>
<li>Counter-example: What do you think of the art style and art quality of the XXX game? [Art style and art quality are two different questions]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid leading questions: Due to the existence of acquiescence bias, players’ answers will be affected by the way of questioning.<ul>
<li>Counter-example: Is the operation of combining rough stones too cumbersome? [Player’s inner thoughts: Is it cumbersome? I didn’t pay attention, so it’s cumbersome]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pay attention to the randomization of options for some questions (completely random, ascending&#x2F;descending order) to eliminate the influence of positive statements (such as choosing the first answer)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Ad Click-Through Rate Prediction?</strong></p>
<p>To understand what ad click-through rate prediction is, we first need to understand the basic components of a general advertising business. A general advertising business can be divided into three main components: advertisers, advertising media, and advertising traffic.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fdc4c2127-0e46-467e-a75f-217f81e86e61.jpg/size/" alt="image.png"></th>

<p>Advertisers are the parties with advertising needs, hoping to increase the awareness of their brand products by exposing advertisements on various media; advertising traffic is the group reached by advertisements, that is, the audience of advertisements. For different types of advertisements, the groups they hope to reach are also different; the advertising medium is the intermediate platform connecting advertisers and advertising traffic. Advertising traffic obtains information from the advertising medium, and the advertising medium will provide the advertising content required by the advertiser to the advertising traffic.</p>
<p>In the past, the main carriers of advertising were billboards, print media, and television, and other traditional media. In the era of mobile Internet, brand advertising exposure based on various applications and portal websites has become a new way of advertising display. Different from traditional media advertising, this type of advertising has the characteristics of large advertising traffic, large amounts of data, and real-time push. Since such advertisements can be directly clicked, many advertising platforms will charge based on the click-through rate of advertisements.</p>
<p>So, how to measure the effectiveness of advertising on such media? Based on this, the concept of ad click-through rate came into being, which is expressed as the ratio of ad clicks to ad impressions over a period of time.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F8afdc99a-034a-4f69-be73-ec1a1ecb85a6.png/size/" alt="image.png"></th>

</thead>
</table>
<p>Since an ad click is a sign that an ad audience is attracted to the ad, ad platforms and advertisers always want to maximize the click-through rate of ads. Different users are attracted to different ads to different degrees. Therefore, as an intermediary, the advertising platform always hopes to push the most attractive ads to each user, so as to maximize the click-through rate of various ads.</p>
<p>To achieve this great goal, the intermediary begins to rack their brains to predict the click-through rate of each advertisement among different groups of people, hoping to know the attractiveness of each advertisement among different groups of people before the advertisement is displayed, so that it is easier to push the advertisement. This process of wanting to achieve the function of predicting the future is called ad click-through rate prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Problems Encountered in Ad Click-Through Rate Prediction</strong></p>
<p>In the previous section, we mentioned that in order to improve the effectiveness of ad display, the ad platform hopes to predict in advance which ad is most likely to be clicked by the same user. Therefore, the ad platform needs to build a model based on data from multiple perspectives such as ad content and ad audience, so as to achieve ad click-through rate prediction. However, some problems encountered in this process may discount the prediction effect, which can be roughly classified into three points:</p>
<p>(1) The advertising platform obtains fewer data fields and has more categorical features. As an intermediary, due to legal factors such as user protection regulations, it is generally difficult for advertising platforms to obtain detailed information about the advertising audience. Even the information obtained is often categorical features such as “whether the mobile phone brand is Huawei”, which makes it difficult to build a model;</p>
<p>(2) Compared with single feature factors, feature interaction factors are more important for click-through rate prediction. For example, middle-aged men from Boston, USA are more likely to click on sports product advertisements. The click of an advertisement is often the result of a combination of multiple feature factors. However, due to the large number of feature interaction items, it is easy to cause feature dimension explosion by constructing interaction features through traversal;</p>
<p>(3) Cold start problem. When a new advertisement is connected to the platform, since it has little sample data, or even no record of the advertisement being clicked, it will be very difficult to predict the click-through rate of the advertisement through a model built based on data.</p>
<p><strong>How to Achieve Ad Click-Through Rate Prediction</strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve ad click-through rate prediction and overcome the three difficulties mentioned in the previous section, some advertising systems often use feature engineering + machine learning model + Bayesian smoothing to achieve this. This article mainly focuses on the machine learning model and Bayesian smoothing.</p>
<p><strong>Logistic Regression Model:</strong></p>
<p>Basic principle: The logistic regression model is a model used earlier in click-through rate prediction. It combines the relationship between features in a linear form and then maps it to a range between 0 and 1, so as to provide the model user with the probability of a user clicking on an advertisement.</p>
<p>What problems are solved:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As shown in the formula, the logistic regression model has a relatively simple form and can still be trained quickly under large-scale feature dimensions;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logistic regression performs well on data based on categorical features, and the data required by the model is more in line with the basic data characteristics of ad click-through rate prediction;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The model is highly interpretable. For an advertising flow, it is easy to know what features of the flow make it more likely to click on the advertisement based on the weight of each feature of the model, which facilitates further optimization of feature engineering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What are the shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It does not solve the problem of the large dimension of feature interaction factors well. Although the logistic regression form is relatively simple and easy to train, based on the construction of interaction items from actual data features, the model still has huge parameters to deal with;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logistic regression performs poorly on continuous variables (such as age, online time, etc.), so continuous variables cannot be well used for modeling in click-through rate prediction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Factorization Machine Model:</strong></p>
<p>Basic principle: In view of the fact that data interaction items are important in ad click-through rate prediction and have a large dimension, the Factorization Machine (FM) model has made targeted processing of interaction item information. Because in actual business, data is often sparse, that is, advertising traffic has no value or meaningless value on most features, the FM model predefines a certain number of derived dimensions, and compresses the huge sparse features to this derived dimension, and only considers the interaction of this part of the derived dimension. This reduces the number of model parameters and takes into account the interaction between features.</p>

<p>What problems are solved:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Transform sparse dimensional data into dense dimensional data to improve model generalization ability;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take interaction items into account and control the number of model parameters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What are the shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The model only considers the interaction between two features, and does not consider the interaction between more features;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since the features are compressed, the interpretability of the model is not as strong as that of the logistic regression model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ensemble Learning Models:</strong></p>
<p>Basic principle: For example, the Xgboost model, GBDT model, and Lightgbm model organize decision trees or regression tree models in a regular manner to improve the generalization ability of the model. Ensemble learning models also consider multi-dimensional interaction factors between features.</p>
<p>What problems are solved:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Multi-dimensional feature interaction information can be automatically discovered according to the tree model;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determine the importance of features according to the weight of different features in the decision tree to make splitting decisions;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What are the shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Since the tree model is limited by depth, the model is still unable to extract higher-dimensional interactions. Generally, it is necessary to use the high-dimensional interaction obtained by the neural network model as a feature to assist decision-making;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The model structure is relatively complex, and its training iteration period is longer than other models. This shortcoming causes difficulties for ad click-through rate prediction businesses that require rapid iteration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In view of the advantages and disadvantages of different models, different models are often used in combination in practice, and each plays its advantages in different links.</p>
<p><strong>Bayesian Smoothing:</strong></p>
<p>Bayes, a probability theory expert who has tortured the majority of mathematics students, believes that everything has a probability distribution. For example, the probability of the sun rising from the west tomorrow is 0%, and the probability of rising from the east is 100%. We can give the probability of many things on various values before they happen. The click-through rate of advertisements is no exception. Perhaps because this pre-given probability distribution is not accurate enough to be convincing, we always hope to correct this experience (prior) that we have pre-determined through the results observed during the actual occurrence. After this correction, our new experience (posterior) will be more credible.</p>
<table>

<th><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F09b2066d-62d0-47fc-8b7d-a55ab3855d7d.jpg/size/" alt="image.png"></th>

</thead>
</table>
<p>Therefore, in order to solve the problem that the model fails due to insufficient samples of new advertisements, Bayesian smoothing abstracts the ad click-through rate into a probability distribution from the perspective of probability statistics. This probability distribution shows the possibility of the click-through rate of an advertisement in different sections.</p>
<p>For the problem that new advertisements do not have enough data to support their probability distribution, the click-through rate probability distribution of other advertisements can be used as the click-through rate distribution of new advertisements. Then, based on the experience of certain data accumulated by the new advertisement during the continuous exposure, this ad click-through rate distribution is corrected. Finally, based on the posterior click-through rate distribution, we take the most likely point of this ad click-through rate as the estimate of the click-through rate of this advertisement.</p>
<p>In this way, not only can the estimated value of the click-through rate of new advertisements be effectively obtained, but also the click-through rate of the model can be corrected each time. For example, a certain model judges that the probability of a user clicking on the advertisement is 10%, but Bayesian smoothing believes that the probability of the click-through rate taking this value is very low and needs to be corrected, so it is adjusted based on the click-through rate distribution. Finally, the adjusted estimated click-through rate will be more accurate.</p>

    <title>Let&#39;s Talk About Interaction Design in Game Settlements</title>
    <url>/2019/06/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20190625_28584_819571/</url>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a reflection on game interaction design, and I want to take this opportunity to talk about the positioning of interaction designers and their core competitiveness.</p>
<p>Everyone should be familiar with the settlement interface. Almost every game has its own settlement interface. As game interaction designers, when faced with such a mature and numerous reference interface requirements, how to make our designs stand out among many competing products has become a problem that needs to be considered. When faced with such a demand, I first chose to see how competing products do it. So I searched for relevant content on Baidu, but the results were very disappointing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fd1c04f58-8026-46d2-996c-11eb34bc9cd0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;d1c04f58-8026-46d2-996c-11eb34bc9cd0.jpg"></p>
<p>The search results are roughly as above. A closer analysis reveals that these settlement interfaces have several commonalities. The basic elements included in the interface can be summarized into the following categories: ribbons, wings, trumpets, stars, etc. These are basic GUI elements. This means that, aside from visual elements, the above settlements have little difference from an interaction perspective.</p>
<p>However, there are many beautifully designed settlements on the market. The following are excellent cases in my mind:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fb6cac392-bb85-4e8e-993e-6e32aca19749.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;b6cac392-bb85-4e8e-993e-6e32aca19749.jpg"></p>
<p>First of all, the settlement of <em>Overwatch</em> is different from the usual ideas. <em>Overwatch</em> first displays the best shots of the game before the settlement values. Even if you are the losing side, you may appear here. This design idea will weaken the performance of the battle’s win or loss, allowing players to focus more on making wonderful operations themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F5b3d75ed-dfc6-4f08-8062-43d1ed888d2b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;5b3d75ed-dfc6-4f08-8062-43d1ed888d2b.jpg"></p>
<p>Secondly, the settlement of <em>Extraordinary Ones</em> also has a new design before the numerical settlement. As a MOBA game, the relationship between winning and losing will greatly affect the player’s emotions. Therefore, as the losing side, a link of blaming teammates is designed before the numerical settlement, which cleverly transforms the original negative emotions of failure into a situation of teasing teammates, greatly reducing the unpleasant experience of failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F0b719de6-860c-490d-976b-38e0ce68ed38.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;0b719de6-860c-490d-976b-38e0ce68ed38.jpg"></p>
<p>The settlement of <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> uses the story bridges in the movie IP, combining the settlement rewards with the movie plot, which is full of situational immersion. This design will make players feel familiar with the game, and it is also more in line with the players’ psychological expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa69562ba-d29d-46f6-b67c-1b0444ab8858.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a69562ba-d29d-46f6-b67c-1b0444ab8858.jpg"></p>
<p>Then there is the settlement of <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>. Winning or losing is not what the designer wants to express most. Compared with winning or losing itself, the designer hopes that the game itself will bring fun to the players. In <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>, the performance of each player is what the designer wants to express more, so it will highlight the display of data such as MVP, most kills, and most siege damage.</p>
<p>Try to analyze what role interaction designers might play in these excellent cases, or what we as interaction designers can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa03be5cf-f23e-4ed5-b5aa-d75941baf172.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a03be5cf-f23e-4ed5-b5aa-d75941baf172.jpg"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to find that in these excellent design cases, designers are no longer only focusing on layout and the expression of visual elements. Designers have begun to think about the core of the game from the gameplay itself, and then apply it to the design.</p>
<p>——This is the core competitiveness of game interaction designers.</p>
<p>Game interaction, as a branch of Internet interaction, is not feasible to completely copy the design thinking of the Internet. Games, as one of the branches of art products, should also be full of artistic features in their design. This also requires us as game interaction designers to think deeper, so sometimes we need to regard ourselves as “half a planner”, to think about the game play itself, and to immerse ourselves in the worldview, only with heart can we make interesting things.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190625/28584_819591.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous two articles shared insights from player testing in Japan and the United States. This time, we want to share some insights from the Internet cafe research conducted by the Leihuo UX department in March 2019. One of our research locations was in Chengdu, and the research content was to understand players’ expectations for new games and new gameplay. The research method combined qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Research-Preparation"><a href="#Research-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Research Preparation"></a>Research Preparation</h2><p>Before the research, both the product team and Leihuo UX were full of curiosity about the front-line market – what games are our users playing? What kind of games are they looking forward to? In addition to in-game questionnaires and in-game player behavior, we should communicate with players face-to-face to understand their real thoughts. This is the motivation for this research.</p>
<p><strong>[Receiving the Demand]</strong> When the UX department received the demand for research in multiple Internet cafes across the country, the team members were eager to try – the food seemed to be a bigger part: It’s not the NetEase cafeteria’s fault, I just shouldn’t have smelled the scent of Sichuan cuisine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F9400214a-4401-47ac-b28b-5466701ed468.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;9400214a-4401-47ac-b28b-5466701ed468.jpg"></p>
<p>(First, arrange all the food)</p>
<p><strong>[Plan Preparation]</strong> Before departure, confirm the usability of the plan, questionnaire, interview outline, and observation record sheet. These quantitative data will play an important role in future reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F8d4d9361-861d-467d-bbac-58acb1b3d00b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;8d4d9361-861d-467d-bbac-58acb1b3d00b.jpg"></p>
<p>(The plan went through repeated revisions and iterations)</p>
<p><strong>[Departure Preparation]</strong> Before departure, based on the experience of Internet cafe research in the Hangzhou area, the Chengdu Internet cafe research team made a schedule based on the location of the Internet cafes to ensure coverage of Internet cafes in different circles. In later reports, it is also possible to observe players’ preferences for games through different circles and different player types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F444ef6d7-ddfb-44e8-9cfd-aa73a26cb0e2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;444ef6d7-ddfb-44e8-9cfd-aa73a26cb0e2.jpg"></p>
<p>(A detailed schedule is essential)</p>
<p><strong>[Plan Preparation Summary]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule:</strong> – Specific to the flight number, the schedule is more precise, but leaves room.</li>
<li><strong>Internet cafe research:</strong> – Prepare alternative research Internet cafes, and strategically abandon the Internet cafe in case of emergencies</li>
<li><strong>Map preparation:</strong> – Let members know which circle I am in</li>
<li><strong>Interview guide:</strong> – Foolproof teaching guide, the final plan completely mastered the interview skills</li>
<li><strong>Reimbursement expenses:</strong> – Remember to get an invoice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Research-Implementation"><a href="#Research-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Research Implementation"></a>Research Implementation</h2><p>Before the research, the marketing expert showed us the vision of this research: “Our Internet cafe player ratio is very high, and there are also many female players.”</p>

<p>(Real Internet cafe research)</p>
<p><strong>[First Day of Research]</strong></p>
<p>None of the team members had experience in Internet cafe research. The first day of trial and error encountered a lot of obstacles. First of all, the motivation for players to come to the Internet cafe is to play games, and a large part of it is to play with friends, so it is difficult to say that they have time to accept an interview that requires a high degree of concentration. Secondly, the noisy environment in the Internet cafe also caused considerable difficulties for the interview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fa28ee440-0c9b-4cbf-9d57-f3b0c6e211ea.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;a28ee440-0c9b-4cbf-9d57-f3b0c6e211ea.jpg"></p>
<p>(The first player in the Chengdu research was interviewed surrounded by 5 staff members, and the player was under great pressure)</p>
<p><strong>[Second Day of Research]</strong></p>
<p>On the second day of Internet cafe research, we figured out the living habits of Internet cafe players. There are actually not many players during the day, and the sample size is limited, but the peak number of Internet cafe players is from 20:00 to 23:00. At this time, the queuing phenomenon in the Internet cafe also provides us with opportunities to find interviewees who are highly willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F9c9c0a21-726e-447e-bf93-421f6da4c9ac.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190625&#x2F;9c9c0a21-726e-447e-bf93-421f6da4c9ac.jpg"></p>
<p>(Current situation of Internet cafes – PUBG and LOL)</p>
<p><strong>[Third Day of Research]</strong></p>
<p>After two days of research, the division of labor within the group was clearer and the cooperation efficiency was higher. According to the time and cooperation degree of the interviewees, we divided the players into two contact types: for players with low willingness, we adopted the rapid interview mode, that is, 1 person interview + 1 person record or 1 person rapid interview + recording. For players who are highly willing to cooperate, we adopt the in-depth interview mode, combining UE interviews with supplementary questions from the planners.</p>

    <title>How to Use Vim</title>
    <url>/2019/06/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20190625_28584_819620/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190625/28584_819620.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="Vim-Application-Background"><a href="#Vim-Application-Background" class="headerlink" title="Vim Application Background"></a>Vim Application Background</h2><p>The full name of the Vim editor is Visual interface improved, and the specific interface is shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2Fc28762ec-32ea-48f0-84bc-51b870181a90.jpg/size/" alt="vim editor interface"></p>
<p>The application scenarios of the Vim editor mainly include:</p>
<p>(1) Need to deploy the environment and develop code in a Linux environment. Linux often requires the use of the VIM editor for code development;</p>
<p>Currently, many IDEs support VIM mode, such as PyCharm&#x2F;IntelliJ IDEA and other mainstream IDEs. The advantage of the Vim editor is that it does not require much mouse operation and can support all operations using the keyboard, achieving fast movement, fast input, and effective block operations. The disadvantage of the Vim editor is that it requires memorizing many operation shortcuts and command lines.</p>
<h2 id="4-Modes-of-Vim-Editor"><a href="#4-Modes-of-Vim-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4 Modes of Vim Editor"></a>4 Modes of Vim Editor</h2><p>The Vim editor has four modes. It is in normal mode by default, including normal mode, insert mode, command-line mode, and visual mode. The conversion relationship between the 4 modes is shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190625%2F38ba847e-448b-4d26-ab7c-99ca78d56d9b.jpg/size/" alt="Conversion relationship of 4 modes of vim editor"></p>

<p>It should be noted here that: all commands can be preceded by a number N, indicating that the following command is executed N times. For example, if you want to move down 3 lines, in addition to using :+3, you can also use 3j to achieve the same effect. In addition, there are actually two types of commands above: one is executed immediately after typing, such as gg; the other is to enter : first (there will also be a slash &#x2F; first later). This type of command needs to be executed by pressing Enter after input, and the same is true in the following tutorial content.</p>

    <title>Mobile Game Social System - Detailed Explanation of Friends Interface Interaction Design (Part 2)</title>
    <url>/2019/06/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20190628_28584_820175/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190628/28584_820175.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The social system has always been an indispensable part of many games. Although it is not directly related to the core gameplay, it is a key system to increase player immersion and improve retention.</p>
<p>In the previous sharing session (click to review), we summarized the functional blocks and detailed information items usually included in the mobile game friends interface (see the figure below), and analyzed the interaction levels and design details that usually need to be considered in the UI design of the casual mobile game friends interface with the <em>UNO!</em> project as an example. In the games we usually encounter, we can also find that the friends interface of common casual mobile games and battle royale mobile games are similar in design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2F02692a17-ad2a-4da5-ad85-759f18c79239.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;02692a17-ad2a-4da5-ad85-759f18c79239.jpg"></p>
<p>However, the design of the friends interface of heavily social MMO mobile games will be different from this, such as <em>A Chinese Ghost Story (倩女幽魂)</em> and <em>Moonlight Blade Mobile (天涯明月刀)</em>. <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> is famous for its excellent social design. First of all, in terms of overall functional blocks, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> also includes existing friends, finding friends, and message notifications. However, in the specific function point planning and interaction design, <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> will have some designs that emphasize and promote social interaction. Here, we will take <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> and <em>UNO!</em> as examples to compare the differences in the design of friends interfaces between heavily social MMO mobile games and casual mobile games.</p>
<h3 id="Home-Page-Structure-Difference-Friends-List-or-Friends-Chat"><a href="#Home-Page-Structure-Difference-Friends-List-or-Friends-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Home Page Structure Difference - Friends List or Friends Chat"></a><strong>Home Page Structure Difference - Friends List or Friends Chat</strong></h3><p>In the previous sharing session, we can see that the home page of the casual friends interface is usually a friends list, listing friends information and including some basic interaction operations and entrances. Friends dialogue is used as a secondary interface, which is entered through the chat entry on the friends list.</p>
<p>The home page of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>‘s friends is obviously different. It directly puts the dialogue window on the home page, and the friends list corresponds to the chat window. Moreover, the default display is not the ordinary friends list, but the recent contacts. The friends list and other detailed information are hidden in the secondary interface.</p>
<p>Putting the chat or detailed information list on the home page, the difference between these two levels clearly reflects the different emphasis. <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> puts the recent contact chat window on the outermost layer, which greatly facilitates and encourages players to have dialogue and interaction with friends, and allows them to view new messages at the first time, which can better promote the formation of social relationships.</p>

<h3 id="Social-Circle-Function-Mengdao-梦岛"><a href="#Social-Circle-Function-Mengdao-梦岛" class="headerlink" title="Social Circle Function - Mengdao (梦岛)"></a><strong>Social Circle Function - Mengdao (梦岛)</strong></h3><p>In the friends interface of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, there is also a special system called “Mengdao”. Mengdao is similar to the function of WeChat Moments and QQ Zone. Players can publish their own status, and other players can leave comments and so on. The addition of the Mengdao system greatly enhances the atmosphere of social interaction in the game. Players can not only share content in the game, but also exchange many feelings outside the game. This makes the social system in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> not only a necessary communication for game play, but also a social circle for players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2F24fad9fc-5e06-4413-bab5-37ac48397f50.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;24fad9fc-5e06-4413-bab5-37ac48397f50.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="Contact-Management-Friend-Grouping"><a href="#Contact-Management-Friend-Grouping" class="headerlink" title="Contact Management - Friend Grouping"></a><strong>Contact Management - Friend Grouping</strong></h3><p>In <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>‘s contact system, friends can be grouped. Combined with a variety of social relationship settings in the game, such as sworn brotherhood, master-apprentice, husband-wife, teammates, etc., players can refine and manage their social relationships. Complex social relationships are the premise for building a player’s social network. However, light social mobile games like <em>UNO!</em> do not have a strong demand for friend grouping. Some will add some labels to the friend entries, such as recent teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2Fe95f79da-e730-4a7d-a701-2288f665c74f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;e95f79da-e730-4a7d-a701-2288f665c74f.jpg"></p>
<p><em>(A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Game Friend Grouping Interface)</em></p>
<p>Through these points, we can find that the friends systems of <em>UNO!</em> and <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> have their own emphasis, which depends on the system’s own positioning of light or heavy social interaction and functional requirements. When we do UI design, we also need to combine the needs of the planning itself to plan the interface hierarchy, consider design details, and emphasize or weaken corresponding elements, in order to better achieve the design goals.</p>

<p>“Wow, everyone bought that new costume, I’m going to get one for my in-game partner!”</p>
<p><strong>—— Conformity</strong></p>
<p>“This weapon skin is on sale for only 99, what a bargain.”</p>
<p><strong>—— Bargain Hunting</strong></p>
<p>“There’s another new lottery event, I’m going to keep drawing, let’s open some boxes.”</p>
<p><strong>—— Customer Loyalty</strong></p>
<p>“Consumption” has unknowingly filled our lives, and games have become an indispensable part of some young people’s consumption. The “psychology” behind it has gradually been recognized by researchers and game developers. So how does consumer psychology come about? What is consumer psychology like in games?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2Fb1465b4e-76ff-4465-9638-66c9e9d43778.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;b1465b4e-76ff-4465-9638-66c9e9d43778.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Definition of Consumer Psychology</strong></p>
<p>Consumer psychology is an emerging discipline that aims to study people’s psychological activities and personality traits in the process of life consumption and daily purchasing behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it important to study consumer psychology?</strong></p>
<p>Why aren’t your players buying your costumes and appearances anymore?</p>
<p>Why did I spend so much money on the game this month?</p>
<p>It’s the game’s anniversary, what gift should I buy for my in-game partner?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2Fd0dd19b1-84e9-4ff1-9572-ad6c86107f0a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;d0dd19b1-84e9-4ff1-9572-ad6c86107f0a.jpg"></p>
<p>Almost all behaviors in the game are directly or indirectly related to consumption. Only by fully understanding the player’s motivation, interests, and cognition can we possibly predict the player’s behavior.</p>
<p><strong>The Origin and Development of Consumer Psychology</strong></p>
<p>According to a review published by Jia, H., Zhou, S., and Allaway, A. W. (2018) in the <em>Journal of Consumer Behavior</em>, research related to consumer psychology appeared as early as the 19th century, when a scholar named Gale conducted an advertising effectiveness assessment based on attention and memory. Of course, when the author searched for information, he found that Fan Li in the Spring and Autumn Period had already analyzed consumer needs and managed business with “Ji Ran’s Seven Strategies”, and Xunzi proposed that production should “nurture people’s desires and satisfy people’s needs” (“Xunzi·Li Lun”), which is about meeting people’s consumption needs; in the West, Xenophon analyzed the relationship between family income and family consumption earlier. Of course, these were some early knowledge accumulation stages that were not systematic and not a discipline. It was not until 1965 that consumer psychology was first truly called a special discipline.</p>
<p>In their article, they mainly used the bibliometric method (simply counting the number of literature Co-citation analysis, the number of authors Co-authorship analysis, etc.) and network analysis (Networking analysis, simply counting keywords) to sort out the origin and development of consumer psychology as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190628%2Fafe4e093-9429-40ad-8216-dd1050df28ea.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190628&#x2F;afe4e093-9429-40ad-8216-dd1050df28ea.jpg"></p>
<p>Among them, the number of articles in the field of consumer psychology remained fairly stable between 1942 and 1992. Later, in the 1990s, as market research emphasized the importance of loyal customers to profitability (Reicheld, 1993) and the importance of branding, branding became very competitive. Since 2006, the number of published consumer psychology articles has increased dramatically, with an average of more than 70 articles published per year. Another important trigger is the popularity of online shopping. In the era of Web 2.0, more and more people are attracted to online shopping, which has triggered important research on consumers’ responses to this new shopping model. In a sense, games are also a derivative of the Web 2.0 era.</p>
<p>Below are two word clouds about consumer psychology in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Last week, a colleague shared the interaction design in game settlement. From a macro perspective, they shared and reflected on the existing settlement design, and concluded that a good settlement should be able to weaken the sense of victory and defeat, shift emotions, and increase the fun of the game, rather than just the notification of victory and defeat and the accumulation of data. I happened to be working on the settlement part recently, so I would like to share some detailed insights on the design of the settlement interface.</p>
<p>First of all, before designing the settlement interface, we need to think about why our game needs settlement. Is it to determine the winner, to reward players, or to allow players to summarize the experience of this battle? The settlement interface is not a single page, but a long string of player experience. Distinguishing the primary and secondary design goals can help us effectively guide the specific design.</p>
<p>For example, the victory&#x2F;defeat animation after a game is the first part of the settlement that players come into contact with. At this time, if you need to emphasize the result of victory or if there is very complicated settlement content later, then use exaggerated animation to display it in the design without adding other information. This often appears in relatively strong competitive games, and victory or defeat itself is also one of the core driving forces of players. However, attention should be paid to the transfer and comfort of the frustration of failure, and the situation of player loss due to the frustration of game failure should be reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2Fe08ef5cc-4ba4-4451-9ef6-42556c21ec82.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;e08ef5cc-4ba4-4451-9ef6-42556c21ec82.jpg"></p>
<p>If we want to emphasize the rewarded items or the player’s score. To attract players through generous prizes and changes in ratings, we can consider reducing the proportion of wins and losses, and adding to rewards. Rewards can even be made into a separate screen of animation to enhance the joy of players, and shift their focus from winning or losing. For ratings, rising in the rankings and surpassing oneself can bring a strong sense of satisfaction to players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2F56782355-e0b2-40c3-b936-6e5b7653ef45.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;56782355-e0b2-40c3-b936-6e5b7653ef45.jpg"></p>

<p>Next, according to “why”, we design “what we want”, that is, what information we need to give to players, which is more important, which is of concern to all players, and which is what high-end players want to see. At this stage, it is necessary to sort out the structure of information in detail with the planner. Many times, the planning draft received by the interaction designer is already categorized by the planner, such as the planning case of the personal record page, the planning case of the team record, etc. They have placed the information from the perspective of the planner, but whether the player is willing to read it and whether they can understand it needs to be considered by the interaction designer. Therefore, when doing this part of the content, you must control the information as a whole, and not just design a single page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2Fe25b1f51-bab8-4d55-b7e2-71ced466e475.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;e25b1f51-bab8-4d55-b7e2-71ced466e475.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition, many times the planner itself is also the most senior player of this game, so many times the plan given by the planner is not friendly to novice players, and novice players will get lost in the ocean of data and cannot find the key points. At this time, it is necessary to do subtraction. A more common method is to divide the information into levels, and hide the more in-depth and secondary information into other tabs or pop-up windows, which can better highlight the core data, and hardcore players can also choose to view more complex information.</p>
<p>Finally, there is how to display. Excel-style data will make players lose interest in viewing. Introducing some three-dimensional models or dynamic visualization data can greatly improve the readability of the data. For example, in <em>Dota 2</em>, players can choose different characters for data comparison, and the economic curve trend chart in <em>Honor of Kings</em> can give players a clearer understanding and feeling of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190702%2F0b4a5eed-9a05-4411-aee1-cf4f88b2a667.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190702&#x2F;0b4a5eed-9a05-4411-aee1-cf4f88b2a667.jpg"></p>

<p>Settlement is the final stage of a game. It is a stage for players to summarize themselves and feedback on the game experience. It is not just cold data and cutscenes, but it can also help players understand the game, improve their skills, and warm up for the next game. A large part of the player’s sense of accomplishment comes from this. Therefore, more design thinking should be invested in the design.</p>

    <title>Western Fonts and Brand Design - Typeface &amp; Brand</title>
    <url>/2019/07/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20190708_28584_821645/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190708/28584_821645.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, many well-known font foundries have been commissioned by large enterprises and public organizations to create and develop thousands of custom corporate fonts. The brand image, as a concrete manifestation of the brand, is composed of many elements, such as: logo, font, brand color, packaging, IP image, etc. Each aspect affects the user’s perception of the brand.</p>
<p>Large enterprises have a wide variety of products under their umbrella, but their logos are diverse, making unification difficult. Using a unified brand font is a simple and effective way to improve the recognition of corporate products.</p>
<p>Speaking of brand font design, we have to mention Akira Kobayashi, a Western font designer who has designed brand fonts for both Alibaba and Tencent in recent years. The following introduces some basic knowledge introduced by Mr. Kobayashi in Western fonts.</p>
<h2 id="1-Western-Fonts"><a href="#1-Western-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="1. Western Fonts"></a>1. Western Fonts</h2><p>Western writing refers to all Western languages, including English, French, German, etc. Compared with Chinese and Japanese characters, Western writing does not have such a long history. Starting from Greek inscriptions, it took about 2000 years for the writing of the Roman Empire to take shape in the 1st century AD.</p>
<p>The classic proportions of the Trajan’s Column inscription in Rome are our best example of capital letters. Later, scribes in medieval monasteries and humanists in the 15th century created contemporary writing styles. Various fonts were born in the following centuries.</p>
<p>Some classic fonts commonly used now are: Helvetica, Arial, Didot, Futura, Univers, Neo Sans, Myriad, Times New Roman, etc.</p>
<h2 id="2-Technical-Terms"><a href="#2-Technical-Terms" class="headerlink" title="2. Technical Terms"></a>2. Technical Terms</h2><p><strong>Glyph &amp; Typeface</strong></p>
<p>“Glyph” refers to the characteristic stroke direction and stroke position of a character that distinguishes it from other characters. If the glyph is compared to the skeleton, then the typeface is equivalent to the muscle attached to the skeleton. For example, SimSun and SimHei have the same glyphs, but different typefaces.</p>
<p>The glyphs of Microsoft YaHei are significantly different from them, mainly in the direction of the strokes.</p>
<p>[Image: Comparison of SimSun, SimHei, and Microsoft YaHei]</p>
<p><strong>Roman Typeface (Serif Typeface)</strong></p>
<p>Roman type, the more authoritative explanation for the origin of serifs is that it is a remnant of the traces of writing with a flat-headed pen when drafting inscriptions in the Roman era.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Serif Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Italic</strong></p>
<p>Italic is a handwriting style used in Italy. The font formed by simply tilting the outline data of the Roman typeface is called “oblique.”</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Italic Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Sans-serif Typeface</strong></p>
<p>In French, “sans” means “without”, and sans-serif means “without serifs”. Sans-serif fonts are ubiquitous in the Internet age.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Sans-Serif Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Script Typeface</strong></p>
<p>[Image: Example of Script Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter Typeface</strong></p>
<p>Also called Gothic, because of its high blackness, it is also called “broken letter”.</p>
<p>[Image: Example of Blackletter Typeface]</p>
<p><strong>Stem</strong></p>
<p>The main stroke of a letter, usually refers to the straight part of the stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Bowl</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the curved strokes of uppercase letters C or O, or lowercase letters b or o.</p>
<p><strong>Counter</strong></p>
<p>The internal space contained in the letter, whether closed or not, such as the area between the two vertical strokes of H or n.</p>
<p><strong>Hairline</strong></p>
<p>The part of the thin stroke.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Stem, Bowl, Counter and Hairline]</p>
<p><strong>Serif</strong></p>
<p>The part with a claw-like or straight shape at the end of the stroke.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bracket Serif</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hairline Serif</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slab Serif</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Swash</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the particularly elongated strokes at the beginning and end of letters, with decorative curved parts.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Swash]</p>
<p><strong>Baseline</strong></p>
<p>Refers to the imaginary line that the bottom of the uppercase letter H or the lowercase letter ∩ touches. The bottom of letters such as O, V, and W deliberately exceeds the baseline slightly, in order to be visually level with the baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Cap Height</strong></p>
<p>Cap refers to the height from the baseline to the top of straight uppercase letters such as H or E. The top line of H or E is called the capline. The top of letters such as O and A will exceed the capline slightly, in order to unify the letter size visually.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing Baseline and Cap Height]</p>
<p><strong>x-height</strong></p>
<p>[Image: Showing x-height]</p>
<p>Compared with the cap height of uppercase letters, in order to refer to the height of lowercase letters, x without upper and lower extensions is used as the representative of lowercase letters, and its height is named x-height.</p>
<p><strong>Kerning</strong></p>
<p>Designers will adjust the width of each character. In Western font design, the end of letter shape design does not mean the completion of the work, but rather that the work is only half done, because there are still hidden and important projects such as letter spacing and kerning settings.</p>
<p>In this UCan conference, Akira Kobayashi compared font design to the propagation of sound. For a font, its letter spacing and whitespace represent its breath and rhythm.</p>
<p>Apple made special style adjustments to the word “click” on the OS X El Capitan official website introduction page, making the letter spacing larger so that the letters of the word would not look like “dick” because they are too close together.</p>
<p>[Image: Showing adjustment to “click” on Apple Website]</p>
<p>For large enterprises, fonts are no longer simply “readable”. Even foreign language fonts must be used in conjunction with the brand image. Although the languages are different, from the perspective of font design, it can reduce the gap between users in various countries. Understanding the design and application of Western fonts can improve the designer’s design ability and artistic quality.</p>

    <title>How Game Camera Angle Affects User Experience</title>

<p>The camera angle is the perspective from which we observe the game. Different games will set different camera angle types for players to choose from.  Convenient operation, not getting lost easily, and a strong sense of immersion are the basis for players to choose a camera angle type. So, what are the common camera angle types in games, and what do these types mean? If a player reports that the camera rotation is uncomfortable, how does a user researcher view and analyze this problem? Today, we will introduce two parts – the game’s operating modes (i.e., different camera angle types) and related camera parameters.</p>
<h2 id="I-Diverse-Game-Camera-Angle-Classifications"><a href="#I-Diverse-Game-Camera-Angle-Classifications" class="headerlink" title="I. Diverse Game Camera Angle Classifications"></a>I.

<p>2D camera angle means that the game only has two dimensions of perspective – up and down, left and right. This camera angle appeared in the earliest arcade games, such as <em>Contra</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>MapleStory</em>, etc., and also in some current parkour games, such as the <em>Ninja Must Die</em> series.</p>
<h3 id="2-Fixed-Camera-Angle-2-5D-Camera-Angle"><a href="#2-Fixed-Camera-Angle-2-5D-Camera-Angle" class="headerlink" title="2. Fixed Camera Angle (2.5D Camera Angle)"></a>2.

<p>In this camera angle type, the player’s camera angle is still fixed, similar to a god’s-eye view. At this time, clicking the left mouse button can reach the designated position, and the right mouse button has no function. WASD controls the character’s forward, backward, left, and right movement. Compared to the 2D camera angle, this fixed camera angle provides forward and backward movement of the character, but the player’s camera angle does not change with the character’s perspective. The game still looks like a plane and does not have a three-dimensional feeling, so this camera angle is between 2D and 3D, which is a 2.5D camera angle.</p>
<p>Currently, some PC games still retain this camera mode, such as <em>JX3</em> and <em>New Chinese Ghost Story</em>, etc. The advantage is that it is easy to operate, and you can move by clicking the mouse. The left hand only needs to press the skill keys on the keyboard. The disadvantage is that the sense of immersion is not as strong as 3D.</p>
<h3 id="3-Traditional-3D-Mode"><a href="#3-Traditional-3D-Mode" class="headerlink" title="3. Traditional 3D Mode"></a>3. Traditional 3D Mode</h3><p>Press and hold the left mouse button to rotate the camera, and press and hold the right mouse button to rotate the camera and character orientation. WASD controls the character’s forward, left&#x2F;right strafing, and backward movement.  Examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p>
<h3 id="4-Free-Camera-Angle"><a href="#4-Free-Camera-Angle" class="headerlink" title="4. Free Camera Angle"></a>4. Free Camera Angle</h3><p>Compared to 2.5D, the traditional 3D mode provides the function of rotating the camera angle, that is, pressing and holding the right mouse button can rotate the camera and character orientation, and clicking the left mouse button can reach the designated position. At the same time, WASD controls the character’s forward, backward, left, and right movement. For example, in the <em>New Chinese Ghost Story</em> mobile game PC version, right-click and hold can rotate the camera and character orientation.</p>

<h3 id="5-Action-3D-Mode"><a href="#5-Action-3D-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Action 3D Mode"></a>5. Action 3D Mode</h3><p>Commonly found in current MMO and FPS games, such as <em>Blade &amp; Soul</em> mode, <em>Moonlight Blade</em> action mode. Moving the mouse can rotate the camera and character orientation. The left and right mouse buttons can be set for skills. WASD controls the character’s forward, left&#x2F;right strafing, and backward movement. In this camera angle mode, the left and right mouse buttons are freed from being used for camera angle conversion and movement, and usually have other functions that can be assigned to the left and right mouse buttons, such as some basic skills, shooting, and aiming in FPS games.</p>
<h2 id="II-Some-Commonly-Used-Camera-Settings"><a href="#II-Some-Commonly-Used-Camera-Settings" class="headerlink" title="II. Some Commonly Used Camera Settings"></a>II. Some Commonly Used Camera Settings</h2><p>The camera mode is a relatively general category of viewing angles. Usually, a game will set a variety of game camera parameters for players to adjust by themselves. This part will popularize and introduce these parameters.</p>
<h3 id="1-Camera-Rotation-Sensitivity"><a href="#1-Camera-Rotation-Sensitivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera Rotation Sensitivity"></a>1. Camera Rotation Sensitivity</h3><p>Camera rotation sensitivity is the most commonly used camera parameter. The principle is that when the perceived amplitude or frequency of movement exceeds a certain appropriate value, the nerve center will cause discomfort, such as dizziness and nausea, to objectively achieve the purpose of preventing the current movement from continuing. This is actually a self-protection mechanism, because large-amplitude and high-frequency movements may cause damage to the human body.</p>
<p>When playing games, especially in action 3D mode, the camera rotation is convenient and only relies on mouse movement, which can easily lead to the camera rotation speed being too fast, causing players to experience 3D motion sickness, get lost, etc. However, if the camera rotation speed is too slow, in more intense fighting operations, the camera rotation will not be able to keep up with the enemy’s movement. For example, some players have reported: “The camera rotation after locking is really slow. If someone flashes behind you, you still have to manually turn around?”</p>
<p>Therefore, providing adjustable camera rotation sensitivity in the game is beneficial to improve the user experience, such as in <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword Mobile</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190711%2F245e1545-9c2c-4d85-86fb-527935edcd52.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190711&#x2F;245e1545-9c2c-4d85-86fb-527935edcd52.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Figure 5: Meteor Butterfly Sword Mobile</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-Perspective-Angle"><a href="#2-Perspective-Angle" class="headerlink" title="2. Perspective Angle"></a>2. Perspective Angle</h3><p>If the FOV (field of view) value is too large, the screen will display more scenes, but the scenes at the edges will be severely stretched. This will produce a continuous stretching effect when turning around, which is very different from the effect seen when the human eye rotates. Some FOVs are too small, like running with a telephoto lens. The characters on the screen are very large, but the image changes quickly during the movement, and the human eye will also not adapt.</p>
<h3 id="3-Viewing-Angle"><a href="#3-Viewing-Angle" class="headerlink" title="3. Viewing Angle"></a>3. Viewing Angle</h3><p>The distance and size of the picture. The closer the distance or the larger the picture, the stronger the sense of presence, which will make the player more immersed, and thus be disturbed by the actions in the game, resulting in dizziness.</p>
<h3 id="4-Frames-Per-Second"><a href="#4-Frames-Per-Second" class="headerlink" title="4. Frames Per Second"></a>4. Frames Per Second</h3><p>The FPS (frames per second) value should be stable. For example, for a head-turning action, you originally wanted to turn 90 degrees in 1 second, but the FPS is unstable and half a beat slower, causing the brain to think it is in place, but the result returned by the eyes is that it is not in place, which will cause the player to experience dizziness.</p>
<h3 id="5-Depth-of-Field"><a href="#5-Depth-of-Field" class="headerlink" title="5. Depth of Field"></a>5. Depth of Field</h3><p>Too much depth of field will make it difficult for the human eye to focus, and multiple focusing difficulties can easily lead to dizziness. Too little will cause image accumulation and the picture will lack a sense of layering, resulting in dizziness.</p>
<p>And some games use “dynamic blur” in the picture to restore the scene seen by the human eye as much as possible, that is, objects moving in the relative direction of the line of sight will appear blurred or shaken, so reduce the “dynamic blur” in the game scene (but reducing it too much will cause the picture to appear intermittent).</p>
<p>Therefore, if a player says that the camera angle conversion is uncomfortable and the camera rotation is a bit dizzy, as a user researcher, you need to think from multiple game aspects and find targeted points for improvement in the game, such as:</p>

<p>Camera angle and target locking are two inseparable game problems. Locking, that is, the selection of the attack target and the locking mechanism, includes free unlocked mechanisms, priority locking mechanisms under various conditions (such as closest distance, lowest health, most recently attacked), intelligent locking mechanisms, and various unlocking mechanisms, etc. Locking is closely related to the camera angle. For example, if a player wants to adjust the follow rate of the attack camera angle, they must first confirm that the game locking state is in unlocked attack mode, such as in <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword Mobile</em>.</p>

    <title>How Interaction Designers Can Quickly Get Started with New Games</title>
    <url>/2019/07/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20190723_28584_824258/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190723/28584_824258.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an interaction designer in a middle platform, we often need to quickly take on new games, connect with upstream and downstream as soon as possible, improve processes, and ensure the implementation of requirements. So, how can we quickly get started with this kind of new game? Based on my recent work experience, I think we should start from the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Type</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, game types are often hybrid. What we need to do is to break it down and see what types it is composed of, so as to find competing products, and then look at the expectations of new games from the player base of competing products. For example, Apex Legends is a professional competitive + battle royale type of game. We see that before its release, there were many competing products in the market for professional competitive and battle royale types, but the combination area was still a blue ocean.</p>
<p>As an interaction designer, when getting started with a new game, you also need to start by clarifying the product type and familiarizing yourself with these competing games, understanding the feelings of existing players, and then bringing in this identity to experience the game feelings of the new project you joined, and conduct an initial user experience run-through.</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Progress</strong></p>
<p>Games have many systems. When taking on a new project, we also need to clarify the current system completion status of the game, because the construction and optimization costs of different systems are different, and the design purposes are also different. For example, interfaces such as settlement emphasize expressiveness, while systems such as mail, chat, and settings pay more attention to unity. The picture shows a system classification form that I often refer to.</p>
<p><strong>Clarify the Risks</strong></p>
<p>After understanding the project type and development progress, the next step is to know what you are going to do. Clarify the risks involved.</p>
<p>When I first joined the project, I felt that the biggest risk was time, which included three aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just arrived at the project, need time to get familiar with the team and process.</li>
<li>Just arrived at the project, need time to learn the UGUI of the Unity engine.</li>
<li>Testing will be conducted within a month, but many interfaces of the game have not yet been designed.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are indeed very tricky problems, and I was once at a loss. So I still sorted out the problems and solved them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>1. Determine Responsibilities and Processes</strong></p>
<p>In the traditional design process, it is more like a linear process. The requirements are given to interaction, the interaction is designed and then given to visual, and then developed and implemented. But in my current project, the connections between these processes are more.</p>
<p>In the face of this situation, there is only one suggestion:</p>
<p>Take the initiative to communicate, and run more to talk face to face!</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn to Use Tools</strong></p>
<p>At NetEase, in order to ensure the final restoration of the system, the interface splicing is done by the interaction designer. In the process of making games with the Unity engine, I think the main points to pay attention to are the following 4 points:</p>
<p><em><strong>Interface splicing, animation production, experience testing, resource management</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Interface splicing: In the process of interface splicing, it is mainly necessary to pay attention to restoring the effect diagram as much as possible, ensuring that the positions of corresponding elements are accurate, the font size and color number are consistent, and there are no missing states; pay attention to the adaptation of different screens, the following of elements and the hierarchical relationship.</em></li>
<li><em>Animation production: Simple animations can help players clarify state changes. Pay attention to the corresponding relationship, position, and hierarchical relationship when making.</em></li>
<li><em>Experience testing: The engine is often the place where new game mechanics first appear. The interaction designer should experience new maps, actions, and scenes in time; then after each splicing, it must be tested! Be sure to ensure that there are no errors before handing it over to others to upload to the public storage.</em></li>
<li><em>Resource management: The UI resources and atlas packaging of the game are also maintained by the interaction designer. Remember to clean up useless resources in time; check existing resources more, find optimization points in time, and optimize.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Looking back, getting started with a new project is a process that requires rapid adaptation and integration, and requires strong communication skills with people and things. The above introduction is all my personal experience, from understanding the game to understanding people to understanding tools, and gradually getting started with the project. I hope it can serve as a starting point and bring some inspiration to everyone.</p>

    <title>A Quick Guide to Steam Sentiment Analysis</title>
    <url>/2019/07/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20190723_28584_824261/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190723/28584_824261.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do we analyze Steam sentiment? Of course, it’s because we have a game recently launched on Steam, which is—<em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>! Interested friends can download and experience it, and show your support!</p>
<p><em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> is a large-scale tactical action online game set in the Ming Dynasty. You will command your troops while fighting on the front lines, launching 15v15 siege battles; and in the vast Eurasian world, conquer cities and create an epic!</p>
<p>Now, let’s get to the point. Regarding the Steam sentiment part, how can we find the reviews we need? What indicators and content should we pay attention to? How reliable are these indicators? And how to read and use the main reviews?</p>
<p>First of all, how do we find the reviews we need? Currently, the reviews are located at the bottom of our product store page. There is a filter box here, sorted by result, by language, by purchase method, and by display score. Filter out the required reviews according to your own needs, and then analyze and summarize them, so that the effect is good.</p>
<p>Then there is the overall rating of the game by players on Steam. The current rating has some text descriptions and also the favorable rating. As shown in the figure below, the current positive rating accounts for 97%, and the text description is “Overwhelmingly Positive.”</p>
<p>Let me ask a small question. Are the ratings in Steam real ratings? Not necessarily. This is the same as buying things on Taobao and rating apps in the Apple Store. Everyone should have heard of the five-star praise梗 (gěng - a Chinese internet slang, referring to something funny or a meme, in this context refers to a sarcastic phrase or inside joke). (Could you provide an image of a “five-star negative review”?) Below is an example of a review from one of our players. He recommends it to other users, but in fact, the descriptions of the shortcomings are all problems of our game, and the emotion tends to be negative, so it means not recommended. So, according to this situation, we can infer the actual positive rating based on the player’s actual expression to make an overall assessment.</p>
<p>Next, I will give you a brief introduction to the main part of our Steam sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>This contains the player’s personal information, how many games he has, and what games they are. This information can be used to effectively assess the player’s type and game experience.</li>
<li>Whether the player is a player who is keen to write reviews, and his historical reviews, you can see the points that players pay more attention to.</li>
<li>This is the length of time the player has experienced. You can combine the length of experience with the focus of the comment content to get the short-term and long-term pain points and cool points of the game.</li>
<li>This is the main content. The analysis points are different, but you should be familiar with the game before analyzing.</li>
<li>Likes of user comments to discover excellent reviews.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every day, our game will have new players joining, and new reviews will be generated, so we also need to follow up in time and iterate our views and opinions on a certain time cycle.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction to our Steam sentiment analysis. I hope everyone can apply it flexibly.</p>

    <title>Design Considerations for Landscape and Portrait Mobile Games</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190723_28584_824308/</url>

<p>Electronic games have developed for more than half a century, from arcades, consoles, handhelds, PCs to mobile games. Electronic games have gone through five generations with the update and iteration of technology.</p>
<p>As software running on mobile phones, mobile games have simple application scenarios and low operation thresholds, thus greatly promoting the expansion and popularization of the game market, making more and more people become mobile game players. Mobile games are divided into portrait and landscape modes, which mainly depend on usage habits and gameplay.</p>
<p>In Japan, players are more accepting of the portrait display of games. According to survey reports and the top-selling mobile games in Japan, a large proportion of the top 100 games are portrait games.</p>

<p>As we all know, the pace of life and work of Japanese people is quite fast. Excluding this time, there is very little time for daily entertainment, and the fragmented time that can be controlled by themselves is concentrated when taking transportation.</p>
<p>Japan’s transportation system is very developed, and the subway and Shinkansen networks are all over the country, which has also become the main mode of travel for Japanese people. During the rush hour of commuting, it is not easy to hold the railing with one hand and the briefcase with the other, and to free up one hand to operate the mobile phone. The two-handed holding requirement of landscape games is obviously inappropriate.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>In contrast, the portrait operation that can be controlled with one hand solves this problem well. Game manufacturers will be precise to the distribution of keys, the position of option arrangement and other details on the basis of portrait display.</p>
<p>Considering all these limitations and opportunities, mobile game developers use the power of the mobile platform to optimize the experience brought by portrait and one-handed control methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>In the area map showing the comfort of the thumb, we can experience the comfort of clicking and sliding the thumb on the mobile phone screen. Here we analyze the right-handed users, and left-handed users can flip over and understand in reverse.</p>
<p>Due to the length limitation of the thumb, the lower right corner area is relatively easy to click, while the top and lower left corner are the most difficult areas to click. Due to the relatively weak operability in portrait mode, game manufacturers mainly focus on casual games in the game category, but of course it is not limited to this.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>From our existing experience, landscape games have always accounted for the majority in the domestic market, because the left and right expansion of the landscape can present a broader picture scene, and naturally contain richer elements.</p>
<p>Moreover, the arrangement of domestic books and printed matter is from left to right, which conforms to the reading habits of Chinese people. In landscape games, it is easy to accept the information replacement in the left and right directions due to reading habits. For example, in horizontal platformer games that constantly move to the right, the newly emerging scene elements can be noticed and information can be received at the first time.</p>
<p>In addition, some games also use the gravity sensor for rotation operations. Although portrait mode sometimes only requires one-handed operation, in order to maintain balance, the other hand is also needed for assistance, holding with both hands.</p>
<p>When holding with both hands in portrait mode, the center of gravity is not in the middle of the two hands. It takes more effort to reach a stable state than when the center of gravity is in the middle of the two hands in landscape mode. Therefore, the way of holding the mobile phone with both hands in landscape mode is more suitable for this type of game.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of smartphones, the size of mobile phone screens is gradually increasing, and one-handed operation has begun to become difficult, making mobile games gradually develop in the direction of landscape mode.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>There is no end to the pursuit of humanization and ease of use in experience design, and the same is true for game products. There is room for thinking behind every familiar operation, and every improvement in user experience is accumulated by seemingly insignificant detail changes. In the field of “games”, which inherently represents “interaction”, this should be even more so.</p>

<p>As a User Experience Researcher (UE), one of the enviable parts of the job is being able to legitimately play games during work hours. This is not slacking off, but an important part of UE’s work - game inspection.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Game-Inspection"><a href="#What-is-Game-Inspection" class="headerlink" title="What is Game Inspection?"></a>What is Game Inspection?</h2><p>Game inspection is actually playing games with a clear purpose, and ultimately producing a game inspection checklist. The purpose of the inspection may be to find problems in the game, or to study the characteristics of competing products.</p>
<p>Compared with QA testing games, UE’s game inspection not only focuses on game bugs, but also pays more attention to problems in the game experience. Novice experience, operation fluency, UI interaction, and various contents that will affect the game experience are all within the scope of the inspection, but there will be different focuses according to the purpose of the inspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190723%2Fbad0ff30-11cb-45ae-84df-4f32697242c5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190723&#x2F;bad0ff30-11cb-45ae-84df-4f32697242c5.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="What-Can-Game-Inspection-Be-Used-For"><a href="#What-Can-Game-Inspection-Be-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="What Can Game Inspection Be Used For?"></a>What Can Game Inspection Be Used For?</h2><p>Game inspection can be applied to all stages of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Development:</strong> UX regularly inspects the version, finds and fixes problems during development; some controversial issues can also be the focus of subsequent player testing.</li>
<li><strong>During laboratory testing:</strong> As a summary of player feedback problems in the test, it usually comes with a list of problems</li>
<li><strong>After launch:</strong> It can be used to test new version content, and may also inspect competing games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among them, the focus of competing product inspection is not to find problems, but to study the design ideas of competing products and discover the highlights&#x2F;features of the game</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-the-Inspection-Checklist-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-the-Inspection-Checklist-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Inspection Checklist Look Like?"></a>What Does the Inspection Checklist Look Like?</h2><p>There is no fixed format for the inspection checklist, but it needs to clearly explain the ins and outs of the problem. Generally speaking, it should include the following elements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190723%2Fbf4af2ff-8e43-4a3b-920d-596a732036c8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190723&#x2F;bf4af2ff-8e43-4a3b-920d-596a732036c8.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem point:</strong> What is the problem, which system is it located in, what is the manifestation of the problem or its impact on the player</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem scenario:</strong> The problem that occurs under what model and what situation can be accompanied by related pictures and texts. The problem scene can effectively help the product reproduce and locate the problem</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem level:</strong> A level of the severity of the problem is determined according to the degree of obstruction of the problem, the frequency of the problem, and the scope of the problem. Conventional problem levels are divided into four levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Level 1 problems represent very serious problems, located in important modules and causing obstacles that a large number of players cannot solve by themselves.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 2 problems represent serious problems, located in relatively important modules and directly hindering many players.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 3 problems represent relatively serious problems, which hinder or cause poor experience for some players, and have a greater impact on the game progress or overall quality experience.</em></li>
<li><em>Level 4 problems represent general problems, which have hindered or caused poor experience for a small number of players, but have little overall impact on the game progress and quality.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-Else-Can-We-Do-with-Game-Inspection"><a href="#What-Else-Can-We-Do-with-Game-Inspection" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can We Do with Game Inspection?"></a>What Else Can We Do with Game Inspection?</h2><p>Game inspection does not have a narrow, rigid process requirement, and has considerable flexibility, as long as it can have a logical idea to set the inspection content and clearly present it. We can even inspect the video of the anchor playing the game, such as the strategy used by the anchor, operating habits, emotional changes, etc., which can become useful information. Play your creativity.</p>

    <title>Common Commands for Data Analysis</title>
    <url>/2019/07/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20190730_28584_825588/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190730/28584_825588.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>In data analysis work, it is often necessary to pre-process data, such as viewing data, data deduplication, and some statistics. Of course, you can choose to use Python, Java, etc. for processing, but if the same thing is handed over to instructions, it may be much more efficient. Below I will introduce some common and effective commands for work.</p>
<h2 id="head"><a href="#head" class="headerlink" title="head"></a><code>head</code></h2><p>The first thing to do when processing data is to see what the data we are facing is. At this time, the <code>head</code> command can be used. For example, <code>head a.txt</code> can output the first 10 lines of the file. Of course, you can modify the number of output lines by using <code>head -n a.txt</code>, and adjust the value of <code>n</code>. At the same time, <code>head</code> can be used in conjunction with other commands through pipes to complete processing needs.</p>
<p>Commonly used methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>head -n file</code></strong>: Display the first <code>n</code> lines of the file.</li>
<li><strong><code>head -c file</code></strong>: Display the first <code>n</code> bytes of the file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wc"><a href="#wc" class="headerlink" title="wc"></a><code>wc</code></h2><p>The <code>wc</code> command is used to count words. The <code>wc</code> command can be used to calculate the number of bytes and words in a file. If no parameters are used, the number of lines, words, and bytes of the specified file will be calculated.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><code>wc a.txt</code></td>
<td><code>lines words bytes filename</code> (The specific numbers will depend on the content of <code>a.txt</code>.)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The <code>wc</code> command can also be used on multiple files, and the information of all files will be汇总 (summarized) in the end.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>wc a.txt b.txt</code> could produce output like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><code>wc a.txt b.txt</code></td>
<td><code>lines_a words_a bytes_a a.txt</code><br><code>lines_b words_b bytes_b b.txt</code><br><code>total_lines total_words total_bytes total</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Commonly used methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>wc -c</code></strong>: Print the number of bytes.</li>
<li><strong><code>wc -l</code></strong>: Print the number of lines.</li>
<li><strong><code>wc -w</code></strong>: Display the number of words.</li>
<li><strong><code>wc -m</code></strong>: Print the number of characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sort-uniq"><a href="#sort-uniq" class="headerlink" title="sort &amp; uniq"></a><code>sort</code> &amp; <code>uniq</code></h2><p>Obviously, these two commands are used for sorting and handling duplicates. Since <code>uniq</code> only handles duplicate adjacent lines, we often see the usage of <code>sort a.txt | uniq</code>. First sort the data, so that we can remove duplicate values.  Of course, <code>sort -u</code> can achieve the same effect. Note the difference between the two when using the <code>-k</code> option. Regular uses can be substituted.</p>
<p>Regarding <code>sort</code>, <code>sort</code> treats each line of the file as a unit, compares them with each other, and the comparison principle is to compare the ASCII values from the first character backwards, and finally output them in ascending order. There are many details that can be discussed, here is a brief introduction to several usages:</p>
<p>First is the <code>-t</code> option, which can specify what symbol is used as a separator, such as <code>sort -t &quot;,&quot; a.txt</code> which uses a comma as a separator;</p>
<p>Then there is the <code>-k</code> option, which can be used to specify keys, such as <code>sort -t &quot;,&quot; -k2 a.txt</code>, which means to sort by the second field after comma separation.</p>
<p>A complex example is: <code>sort -t &quot;,&quot; -k1.2,1.2 -k3,3nr</code> which means to sort by the second character of the first column, and if they are the same, sort the third column in descending order according to numerical standards.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input (<code>a.txt</code>):</strong></p>
<p>apple,banana,10<br>grape,orange,5<br>apple,cherry,20</p>
<p>Running <code>sort -t &quot;,&quot; -k1.2,1.2 -k3,3nr a.txt</code> would produce:</p>
<p>grape,orange,5<br>apple,banana,10<br>apple,cherry,20</p>
<p>Commonly used options for <code>sort</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>-c</code></strong>: Check if the file is already sorted. If not, it will prompt from which line the disorder starts.</li>
<li><strong><code>-t</code></strong>: Specify the separator.</li>
<li><strong><code>-n</code></strong>: Sort according to numerical value.</li>
<li><strong><code>-r</code></strong>: Descending order.</li>
<li><strong><code>-u</code></strong>: Ignore identical lines.</li>
<li><strong><code>-k</code></strong>: Sort by which interval.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grep"><a href="#grep" class="headerlink" title="grep"></a><code>grep</code></h2><p>The next thing to introduce is the three musketeers of Linux, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. Each item can be described in a very long space. Here are some commonly used methods in work, which can help us better understand in the future.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> is the global search for regular expressions and print, which is relatively straightforward to translate into Chinese. As the name suggests, it can search, print, and importantly, it can use regular expressions to assist in completion.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a file <code>a.txt</code>:</p>
<p>hello world<br>welcome<br>hello again</p>
<p>The simplest way to use <code>grep</code> is to directly search the file for the string you want to match, such as:</p>
<p><code>grep &#39;hello&#39; a.txt</code></p>
<p>As you can see, it prints all lines in the file that contain <code>hello</code>.</p>
<p>hello world<br>hello again</p>
<p>When using <code>grep</code>, we have many parameters to choose from to assist in completing the requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>grep -i</code></strong>: Case-insensitive.</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -v</code></strong>: Match lines <em>not</em> containing a pattern.  <code>grep -v &#39;hello&#39; a.txt</code> would match the <code>welcome</code> line.</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -n</code></strong>: Display the line number of matching lines.</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -E</code></strong>: Allows the use of extended regular expressions (equivalent to using <code>egrep</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -c</code></strong>: Print the number of matching lines.</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -l</code></strong>: Can search in multiple files and print the file where it is located.  <code>grep -L</code> indicates files <em>not</em> containing the pattern.</li>
<li><strong><code>grep -A n</code>, <code>grep -B n</code>, <code>grep -C n</code></strong>: These three options display <code>n</code> lines <em>after</em>, <em>before</em>, or <em>around</em> (context) each matching line, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are some options that are often used in work. Of course, there are also some very useful ones such as <code>-r</code>, etc. A very important condition is that you need to have more knowledge of regular expressions to maximize the power of <code>grep</code>. Regular expressions are not described in detail here.</p>
<h2 id="sed"><a href="#sed" class="headerlink" title="sed"></a><code>sed</code></h2><p><code>sed</code> is a stream editor, a very important text processing tool, mainly used in conjunction with regular expressions, and is good at replacing. During processing, the currently processed line is stored in a temporary buffer, and then the content in the buffer is processed with <code>sed</code>. After completion, the content of the buffer is printed to the screen, and then the processing of the next line continues until the end of the file.</p>
<p>The most basic command is in the form of <code>s/old/new/g</code>, that is, search for <code>old</code> and replace <code>new</code> globally. Without <code>g</code>, it will terminate when <code>old</code> first appears. Similarly, when we replace content in <code>vim</code>, we also use a similar form.</p>
<p>Here’s an example to introduce some commonly used methods, mainly involving regular expressions. Let’s say we have a file with the following content:</p>
<p>1,234,567 JJ<br>9,876,543 KK</p>
<p>First, we need to remove the commas from the numbers. Use the following command. As you can see, for the matched content, we can use <code>\1</code> and <code>\2</code> to represent the matched content. Pay attention to the content in the parentheses in the regular expression, which is what we often call grouping, that is, the matching item:<br>bash<br>cat a.txt | sed -r ‘s&#x2F;([0-9]),([0-9])&#x2F;\1\2&#x2F;g’</p>
<p>This will result in:</p>
<p>1234567 JJ<br>9876543 KK</p>
<p>Using the <code>-r</code> option with <code>sed</code> allows us to use extended regular expressions; otherwise, we need to pay attention to many details, such as escaping parentheses.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can use <code>&amp;</code> to replace the matched string, such as using <code>cat a.txt | sed &#39;s/\w\+/[&amp;]/g&#39;</code>.  (Assuming the output of the previous command has been redirected to <code>a.txt</code>).</p>
<p>This would result in (note, without <code>-r</code> you might need <code>sed &#39;s/\w\+/\[&amp;\]/g&#39;</code>):</p>
<p>[1234567] [JJ]<br>[9876543] [KK]<br>Similarly, you can use <code>sed</code> for filtering, or you can call it deletion. We can also do this using <code>grep -v</code> mentioned earlier.  Using <code>cat a.txt | sed &#39;/JJ/d&#39;</code>, we can successfully remove the line containing <code>JJ</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>sed</code> has many more interesting functions. There are special books on <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, and you can also see that the knowledge in them is very deep. This is just a brief introduction that can make daily work convenient.</p>
<p>Other commonly used options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>sed -i</code></strong>: Edit the file content directly, which means that using replace will change the file content.</li>
<li><strong><code>sed -e</code></strong>: Implement multi-point editing.  <code>sed -e ... -e ...</code>  The result of the previous one will affect the following ones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="awk"><a href="#awk" class="headerlink" title="awk"></a><code>awk</code></h2><p>This command is really hardcore, and it can actually be regarded as a programming language.</p>
<p><code>awk</code> is a programming language tool for processing text. It reads input files, sorts data, processes data, performs calculations on input, and generates reports, and there are countless other functions.</p>
<p>The main idea is to scan the data in the text file or text stream line by line, perform pattern matching on the current line of text, and if the match is successful, continue to execute the content of the data processing module, otherwise continue to process the next line of data.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. When processing logs, a simple scenario of using <code>awk</code>. The following is a simulated login log, and the data are all simulated. Only two of them are put here, and there are multiple items in the file. We need to count the types of <code>app_channel</code> after deduplication.</p>
<p>2019-07-24 10:00:00,user1,login,app_channel&#x3D;”channel_a”,other_data<br>2019-07-24 10:01:00,user2,login,app_channel&#x3D;”channel_b”,other_data</p>
<p>First of all, we need to get the corresponding content of <code>app_channel</code>, and we need to extract it. Of course, we can also use regular expressions here, but I want to introduce the <code>awk -F</code> command, which can specify the input separator. The separator can be a string or a regular expression. We can use this command repeatedly here to finally get the corresponding content.</p>
<p>First, we separate according to <code>&quot;app_channel&quot;</code>:<br>bash<br>cat log.txt | awk -F ‘app_channel&#x3D;”‘</p>
<p><code>&#123;print $2&#125;</code> after that means that we want to print the second part after separation. The result is as follows:</p>
<p>channel_a”,other_data<br>channel_b”,other_data<br>We can see we need another separation.  We can clearly use the quotation mark as a delimiter to get the channels:<br>bash<br>cat log.txt | awk -F ‘app_channel&#x3D;”‘ ‘{print $2}’ | awk -F ‘“‘ ‘{print $1}’</p>
<p>This gives us the channel names. The next steps involve <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code>, as shown above.</p>
<p>To count each channel, you can use awk’s associative arrays (similar to Python dictionaries):<br>bash<br>cat log.txt | awk -F ‘app_channel&#x3D;”‘ ‘{print $2}’ | awk -F ‘“‘ ‘{print $1}’ | awk ‘{channels[$1]++} END {for (channel in channels) print channel, channels[channel]}’<br>This takes the extracted channel name (<code>$1</code>) and increments a count in the <code>channels</code> array. The <code>END</code> block prints out the counts for each channel after processing all lines.</p>
<p>You can see that if we put the data into the database and use SQL to complete the requirements every time we encounter such a situation, it is certainly possible, but as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, instructions often bring efficiency. If it involves the association with other data to complete the requirements, then it still needs to be processed in the database with SQL.</p>
<p>Of course, the function of <code>awk</code> is far more powerful than this small requirement. It is really unrealistic to expand on it. You can add a little difficulty to think about it. For example, to count each channel, you can use the array usage of <code>awk</code>. The array of <code>awk</code> can be characters or strings, similar to the assignment and value retrieval methods of dictionaries in Python. Then here we can use the data of the previously extracted channels for further processing.</p>
<p>Here is the basic structure of <code>awk</code>:</p>
<p>awk ‘BEGIN{ commands } pattern{ commands } END{ commands }’</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to execute the statements in <code>BEGIN&#123; commands &#125;</code>.</li>
<li>The second step is to read a line from the file or standard input, and then execute the <code>pattern&#123; commands &#125;</code> statement block. It scans the file line by line and repeats this process from the first line to the last line until the file is completely read.</li>
<li>The third step is to execute the content of <code>END&#123; commands &#125;</code> when the end is reached.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can compare it with the command we processed channel counts above, and the basic structure is consistent.</p>
<p>So far, I have briefly introduced six commonly used commands for data analysis. These are all good helpers for data analysis work, because analysis is inseparable from the support of data. How to process it efficiently will also help us complete the analysis tasks more reasonably and accurately. Of course, there are many other useful commands, such as <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>join</code>, etc., all of which can well assist us in completing the requirements. Each command also has many functions worth our in-depth understanding. When they are used in combination, they are even more powerful. And my introduction above is just very basic and daily functions. You can do more discussions and explorations.</p>

    <title>UI Sharing: Situational Design in Games</title>
    <url>/2019/07/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20190730_28584_825616/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190730/28584_825616.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p><em>July, the scorching airflow roasts the road surface, and the young people on the street seem to be sizzling squids, constantly sweating. The sun seems to have no intention of “stopping for today” and continues to thrust its passion into this somewhat weary world. I lie on an IKEA beach chair that cost 100 yuan, gulping down ice-cold fresh watermelon juice while fantasizing about the sunset beach of Swansea.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situationalization</strong></p>
<p>Situational design is about letting you feel the temperature of the sun through the screen. The design itself does not emphasize allowing players to achieve their goals as quickly as possible, but rather allowing players to incorporate emotional changes during the operation process, ultimately leaving a deep impression.</p>
<p>Successful emotional design can help games stand out in homogeneous competition, improve user loyalty and recognition, and allow users to spontaneously participate in the dissemination of the game.</p>
<p>Situationalization can be said to be an add-on to interaction design. On the basis of interactive usability and ease of use, it allows players to obtain a richer and higher-quality process experience. The so-called flow state is that wonderful moment!</p>
<p><strong>Situationalization is More Than Just Games</strong></p>
<p>The concept of situationalization does not only exist in games, but often appears in life. As mentioned in “Designers Need to Understand Psychology,” people are more willing to listen to stories than to resumes. The description of story scenarios can better help people understand the content you want to express, and it is also more immersive, containing more emotional expression.</p>
<p>In fact, we have all been exposed to situationalization since we were very young. If you still remember the inspirational stories you wrote in the examination room, and the dark clouds and heavy rain in the stories. In fact, this is the most natural situational design. Through various strange weather environments, it expresses and renders the tragic experience and mood of the protagonist, guides the reader to resonate, and promotes the plot. In games, it’s like this.</p>
<p>Players will not improve their clearance rate or experience better operation because of this design, but the immersion of the environment will enhance their emotional experience during the game, and even push it to a climax in the game!</p>
<p><strong>Situationalization and Interactive Experience in Games</strong></p>
<p>Here I recommend two situational design games that are worth playing. If you are interested, you can download and experience them.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></p>
<p>Players will explore the East India Company merchant ship “Obra Dinn,” which was missing and drifting outside in 1808 and was finally discovered, from a first-person perspective.</p>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship “Obra Dinn” left the port in London, fully loaded with more than 200 tons of trade goods and headed for the Far East. But six months later, it did not appear at the loading and unloading stop in the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, and was declared missing at sea.</p>
<p>Until the early morning of October 14, 1808, the merchant ship “Obra Dinn” slowly drifted into the port, with the sails severely damaged and no crew members visible. As an insurance estimator from the London office of the East India Company, the protagonist boarded the ship to assess the insurance, find a way to restore the crew roster, and further discover what happened on the ship.</p>
<p>When the player first boards the ship, the boatman cannot carry the box and needs the player to take out the things in the box. You will find that in addition to the magical pocket watch, there is also a booklet. This booklet has hundreds of pages and contains not only the previous roster, but also all the important content needed to play this game. As the game progresses and the player explores, this content will gradually become richer.</p>
<p>There are many interactions with the scene in the game, as well as many wonderful props; and they are handed over to the player to discover through some inadvertent moments.</p>
<p><em>Donut County</em></p>
<p>With “a (growing) hole that devours everything” as the core gameplay, coupled with a fresh and lovely art style, even without the background bonus of publisher Annapurna and developer Ben Esposito, <em>Donut County</em> is enough to whet players’ appetites. The six-year development process and the plagiarism storm that occurred near the release are certainly regrettable, but the final <em>Donut County</em> that appears in front of us has too much irreplaceability beyond the gameplay.</p>
<p>Around the design of the hole, <em>Donut County</em> tells an allegorical adult fairy tale in a form similar to a fireside chat. Every line of dialogue seems to be carefully written, and in this process, the shaping of the group portrait is extremely successful. Of course, the most popular character is the philosophical raccoon. The game’s bestiary is like his poetry collection.</p>
<p>There are almost no fixed UI elements in the game screen, and all interactions are guided by the player during the game. This makes the game experience itself smooth and unstoppable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the purpose of situationalization itself can be divided into two types. One is to create an atmosphere to make the player’s emotional experience richer; the other is to integrate the functional interaction itself into the game’s plot. At this time, the player will probably think, “Oh, can I click this?” or “Ah, it seems that I need to open this door?”; when the player really triggers the interaction, they will exclaim WOW, Awesome.</p>
<p>So on such a hot day, when you see a glass of iced watermelon juice, you will definitely want to pick it up and imagine your sunset beach.</p>

    <title>How to Become an Interview Master (Part Two)</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190730_28584_825624/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190730/28584_825624.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last time we talked about the first level of becoming an interview master:</p>
<p><strong>Being a Good Voice for the Players</strong></p>
<p>Let’s review some key points of the first level of being an interview master.</p>
<p>The keyword for being a good voice for the players in the first level of interviewing is “deconstruction”.</p>
<p>How to deconstruct?  Because players don’t have the professional ability to break down problems, we need to guide them step by step within a framework to discover the root of the issues, gradually mapping the players’ feedback to the game design.</p>
<p>Accumulating these frameworks requires playing games regularly and doing more game deconstruction thinking when problems are discovered.</p>
<p>Besides understanding basic interview question deconstruction, what other abilities are needed to conduct a good interview?  Today, let’s talk about the second level of interviewing:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Players</strong></p>
<p>First, let’s look at an example. In a test, two players had completely different feedback on the same content of the same game:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Player 1</th>
<th align="left">Player 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">“This game is way too easy!”</td>
<td align="left">“This game is way too hard!”</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So, with this kind of test result, should we suggest the developers make it easier or harder?</p>
<p>Don’t rush to a conclusion.  Let’s first find out who these two players are.</p>
<p>It turns out that the player who said the game was easy is a veteran player with T2 level game operation ability, while the player who said the game was too difficult is a casual player.</p>
<p>It can be seen that players with different backgrounds will bring completely different feedback.</p>
<p>In our interviews, to understand <em>why</em> someone gives specific feedback, we need to further understand what kind of player they are, including their gaming background, educational background, and even their lifestyle.</p>
<p>A person’s past cognition, experience, needs, and attitudes often determine some of their present and future behaviors. The behavior shown by the player and the feedback expressed are just the tip of the iceberg. We need to dig out the underlying needs and motivations under the iceberg.</p>
<p>So, when understanding a player, what information do we usually collect?</p>
<p>This can be divided into two categories: one is demographic characteristics, and the other is game characteristics.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Demographic Characteristics:</strong> Demographic information, income level, time characteristics, gaming environment, cultural environment, etc.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Game Characteristics:</strong> Previous game experience, game interests, social habits, operational ability, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some common player characteristics:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Time Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>This mainly refers to the player’s occupation. Generally, we will divide players into working professionals, students, and freelancers. The free time characteristics of these three types of players are very obvious. Office workers generally work during the day and play games at night, while students are more active on weekends and holidays, and freelancers are often the “time warriors” in the game. When players report that there are too many or too few activities, it’s helpful to understand their occupation.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Income Level:</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, high-spending players don’t care about how much money they spend. They are more concerned about how long it will take to fill the “pit”. Many high-spending players are impatient and want to max out their gems and pets in one day.  Casual players and low- to mid-spending players are more sensitive to prices, especially for newly opened numerical sinks, and price increases of some items can be expected to receive a large amount of complaints the next day. Therefore, what needs to be noted here is that it is necessary to understand which player segment an activity or some cultivation content is targeting.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Game Interests:</strong></p>
<p>In the same game, different players have very different interests. Some players like to find people to PK and fight everywhere in the game, while others like to roam the map and enjoy the scenery in a more relaxed way. Different gameplay activities also have their own labels. If the label of a gameplay does not match the label of a certain player, then this gameplay may not be well received by the player even if there is no problem in design. Therefore, research on a certain gameplay also needs to find the core players of this gameplay to do some interviews. For example, for a PK-type gameplay, more feedback on combat experience can be obtained from PK-type players, and they can even help you analyze the balance of professions. But if you encounter a casual player, you may get feedback that this gameplay is not interesting and the rewards are not rich enough.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Different Operational Abilities:</strong></p>
<p>This should have been deeply understood in the example at the beginning. Before the game test, we generally use questionnaires to measure the player’s operational ability, and then look at their feedback in combination with their operational ability. So if you encounter the two opposite types of feedback mentioned above, whether the game should be made more difficult or easier depends on what kind of players the core target audience of this game is. If you want to cover those ordinary players with not very high operational ability, then the game will inevitably need to reduce the difficulty; if the game itself has a difficulty threshold and is known for its difficulty, then it needs to stick to itself. After all, a game does not have to meet the needs of everyone. Just strive to give players who like this type of game the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>The above is the content of the second level of being an interview master.</p>
<p>To review, the second level of becoming an interview master is:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Players</strong></p>
<p>Why do you need to understand your players? Because every game, every game content has its preset core target group, and collecting feedback from the corresponding core players can better help improve the game or the game content.</p>
<p>When understanding a player, we generally start with their demographic characteristics and game characteristics. In detail, it will also include demographic information, income level, time characteristics, game environment, cultural environment, previous game experience, game interests, social habits, operational ability, etc. As for when you need to understand which characteristics of the player, it depends on the characteristics of the core target group mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So, in summary, we have already finished talking about the two levels of becoming an interview master. Some people may ask, what is the third level? The place to practice the third level is here:</p>

<p>This US (User Study) sharing introduces a practical feature construction tool for feature engineering in data mining model building - <code>tensorflow.feature_column</code>, which is the feature column interface of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>The TensorFlow framework is widely used in building deep learning models. Its feature column interface (<code>feature_column</code>) can be used to implement the construction and processing of various features. This interface provides a wealth of feature tools.</p>
<p>In TensorFlow version 1.14, the TensorFlow feature column interface provides the following tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>bucketized_column</code>: Discretization of continuous features by bucketing.</li>
<li><code>categorical_column_with_identity</code>: One-hot encoding of categorical ID features.</li>
<li><code>crossed_column</code>: Feature crossing of categorical features.</li>
<li><code>embedding_column</code>: Embedding feature compression of sparse categorical feature matrices.</li>
<li><code>sequence_categorical_column_with_identity</code>: Categorical encoding of sequence features.<br>…</li>
</ol>
<p>The feature column interface tools provided by the official TensorFlow documentation.</p>

<p>It can be found that the number of rows in the output result is the number of data samples, and the columns are the collection of the original feature results and the judgment values of whether the results fall into each bin. This display method more intuitively reflects the bin interval in which each value is located.</p>

<p>The <code>key</code> part inputs the corresponding feature name, and the <code>num_buckets</code> part indicates how many ID categories there are, corresponding to the range [0, num_buckets-1]. If in the actual feature, the ID value is greater than the upper bound of <code>num_buckets</code>, the program will report an error. After determining <code>num_buckets</code>, tf implements one-hot encoding.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>default_value</code> specifies the situation of extra features appearing in the feature column, that is, the ID value is greater than the upper bound of the ID value range. If <code>default_value</code> is set, these extra ID values will be classified as <code>default_value</code>, but note that the value of <code>default_value</code> also needs to fall within the ID value range.</p>

<p>It solves the classification problem when there are too many categories in practical problems. If there is no good manual classification index, the hash classification method is used to divide different fine-grained values into a coarse hash bucket. It uses the method of hashing and modulo operation on the same feature with different values to obtain the binning result of different values, so as to realize binning. It can be found that this will classify some irrelevant values into one bucket. Therefore, the number of buckets specified by this bucketing method should be large, as a preliminary bucketing of feature data.</p>

<p><code>embedding_column</code> can compress a sparse data matrix into a dense matrix to reduce dimensionality. Where <code>dimension</code> represents the dimension after data compression, and <code>combiner</code> represents the processing method of reduce in the data compression process, generally including mean, standard deviation (sqrtn), and sum.</p>
<p><code>embedding_column</code> requires that the input data is a categorical sparse matrix. If the feature is originally a continuous feature, it needs to be discretized using the bucketing method and then input into <code>embedding_column</code>.</p>

<p>Through this method, combined with tools such as <code>crossed_column</code>, it can be applied to scenarios such as advertising click-through rate prediction that involve sparse features and important cross features.</p>
<p>In addition to the several tools introduced above, the TensorFlow feature column interface also provides many other useful feature engineering tools, such as <code>linear_model</code>, <code>sequence_categorical_column</code>, etc., to meet different feature data processing needs.</p>

    <title>Four Principles of Game Interface Design</title>
    <url>/2019/08/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20190806_28584_826841/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190806/28584_826841.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although game interfaces are more free and lively than internet APP product interfaces, the layout design of game interfaces still needs to follow certain principles. This article shares four principles of design: <strong>contrast, proximity, unity, and alignment</strong>.</p>
<p>To better understand, the following uses the X game interface as a carrier for explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2F269ddf40-62bd-4b65-89ef-b41a2b2ed97c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;269ddf40-62bd-4b65-89ef-b41a2b2ed97c.jpg"></p>
<p>Its interface GUI design was not ugly at the time, but the entire interface gave a strong sense of clutter. This is because it did not follow the principles of proximity, contrast, and unity in the four design principles.</p>
<h3 id="Contrast-Principle"><a href="#Contrast-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Contrast Principle"></a>Contrast Principle</h3><p>The principle of contrast means highlighting what should be highlighted and weakening what should be weakened. When designing the interface, the planner will often give a lot of information that needs to be put up, but the designer cannot just pile it up. It is necessary to sort out the information first, place the key information in the visual core position, and emphasize it, such as more refined GUI beautification, larger and more gorgeous fonts, and so on. Other less important information needs to be relatively weaker.</p>
<p>The information content in the screen, each wants to highlight itself, and the content is scattered throughout the interface, making people not know where to look, and it is easy to miss important information.</p>
<h3 id="Proximity-Principle"><a href="#Proximity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Proximity Principle"></a>Proximity Principle</h3><p>The principle of proximity is to integrate similar information together. For example, the primary buttons on the screen, refining, lineup, learning, illustrations, etc., need to be placed in a connected position. Player information, the name on the screen, intimacy, technical travel and combat power also need to be integrated together.</p>
<h3 id="Unity-Principle"><a href="#Unity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Unity Principle"></a>Unity Principle</h3><p>The principle of unity, that is, in an interface, its colors and elements need to be repeated to make it a whole. In this interface, the colors have been well unified, mainly yellow and black, so looking at the color distribution alone, without looking at the information, will not give people a too chaotic feeling. But the elements have not been repeated. There are too many elements distributed in the picture, including various sizes of fonts, flat and retro style collisions and overlaps, which increases the chaos of the interface.</p>
<p>Around the problems of the above three principles, the interaction designer iterated the interface. The following figure is the effect after the designer’s iteration. Although the overall is not as cool as before, it achieves the effect of information integration and a clear interface. Each piece of information is organized and presented, important information is placed in the visual center, the buttons are easy to operate, and the elements are also flattened as a whole. After iterating according to the four principles of design, the original chaotic interface layout was optimized into a new interface with clear information at a glance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fc1dc72f8-fe81-4a75-9408-06ae2bdb2be7.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;c1dc72f8-fe81-4a75-9408-06ae2bdb2be7.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Alignment-Principle"><a href="#Alignment-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Alignment Principle"></a>Alignment Principle</h3><p>Finally, let’s look at the significance of the alignment principle for game interface design. Alignment is the basis of interface design. The above three points may require a certain amount of accumulation by the designer to achieve, but alignment can be said to be a kind of consciousness without technical content, and it is the minimum requirement that designers need to follow. The design interface in the figure below does not follow the principle of alignment. It gives a very cheap and low-quality visual feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fcb4b8cf3-a234-4d28-b578-c4caf465b089.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;cb4b8cf3-a234-4d28-b578-c4caf465b089.jpg"></p>
<p>The interface in the figure below follows the principle of alignment. It appears very neat and clear in terms of information layout. The comparison between the two is immediately apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190806%2Fad24b3ec-f005-4178-ab15-ce741c3b8139.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190806&#x2F;ad24b3ec-f005-4178-ab15-ce741c3b8139.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, following the principle of alignment does not mean that every interface needs to rigidly layout information. In the main interface of the game, some misaligned layout styles do not affect the overall interface, but will add a little agility. The alignment principle is more used in interfaces that aim to present the content of the information itself.</p>
<p>The above four principles are summarized by game designers after years of practice, and do not represent the industry’s standards. As a designer, after a long period of accumulation, more or less, you will summarize some of your own experience and methodology. As a design beginner, learning from the experience left by predecessors can help you avoid many detours, and these four principles are the same.</p>
<p>Learn, apply, expand, but don’t be rigid.</p>

    <title>Game Interaction Design and Psychology - Interpreting Susan Weinschenk&#39;s &quot;100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People&quot;</title>
    <url>/2019/08/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20190816_28584_828467/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190816/28584_828467.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Susan Weinschenk, from the psychological perspectives of how people observe, read, remember, think, perceive, make decisions, concentrate, and the source of human motivation and sociality, analyzes and summarizes how to apply this psychological knowledge in design. For interaction design that emphasizes user experience, it can be regarded as a must-read book.</p>
<p>The brain receives about 40 million sensory inputs per second and tries to fully parse their meaning. It will guess what we see based on past experience - heuristics.</p>
<p>Reasonable use of shapes and colors can affect what people see.</p>
<p>What others see on your website may not be what you intended. Their personal background, cultural level, familiarity with the things in front of them, and what they expect to see will all affect their observation results.</p>
<p><strong>Peripheral vision is more likely to attract attention</strong></p>
<p>People use peripheral vision when looking at a computer screen, and often judge the content of the entire page by just glancing at the peripheral vision area.</p>
<p>Although the center of the screen is an important central vision area, don’t ignore the peripheral vision area. Be sure to ensure that the peripheral content clearly shows the purpose of the webpage.</p>
<p>If you want users to focus on a certain part of the screen, don’t place animations and flashing elements in the peripheral vision area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fc54cea66-47b2-4855-a5ae-6eff40267111.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;c54cea66-47b2-4855-a5ae-6eff40267111.jpg"></p>
<p>In <em>The Last of Us</em>, in order not to interrupt the player’s immersion in the plot, the interface elements are cleverly hidden.</p>
<p><strong>People look for patterns when recognizing objects</strong></p>
<p>Since people will involuntarily look for patterns, use patterns as much as possible, and use grouping and spacing to create patterns.</p>
<p>To make an object (such as an icon) easy to recognize, draw it with simple geometric shapes. This will make the geometric ions that make up the object more obvious, thereby making it faster and easier for people to recognize the object.</p>
<p>Use two-dimensional elements more and three-dimensional elements less. The brain receives the information observed by the human eye in a two-dimensional form, so three-dimensional graphics on the screen may slow down the speed of recognition and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fab80e70b-5cb7-4592-8314-6fd4c1a0c1d4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;ab80e70b-5cb7-4592-8314-6fd4c1a0c1d4.jpg"></p>
<p>At the beginning of designing a character, the geometric relationship of the character’s silhouette should be considered. In fast-paced competitive games, different characters need to have clear geometric differences, which can prevent players from cognitive difficulties in intense battles.</p>
<p><strong>The brain has a special area for recognizing faces</strong></p>
<p>When people look at a webpage, they first recognize and react to faces (at least people without autism do).</p>
<p>On a web page, a face looking directly at the user is the most contagious, perhaps because the eyes are the most important part of the face.</p>
<p>If the eyes of a person on a webpage are looking at a nearby location or product, people tend to look at the same place, but not necessarily pay attention, just look.</p>
<p><strong>9% of men and 0.5% of women are color blind</strong></p>
<p>When designing pictures and websites, use <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/">www.vischeck.com</a> or colorfilter.wickline.org to check and see the effect of color blindness.</p>
<p>If you use color to represent a specific meaning (such as green for things that need urgent processing), you should also use another distinguishing scheme (things that need urgent processing should not only be set to green, but also have a box around them).</p>
<p>When designing a color scheme, consider using colors that everyone can recognize normally, such as different shades of brown and yellow. Avoid using red, blue, and green.</p>
<p><strong>The mystery of the difficulty of reading uppercase words (a point of view based on English design)</strong></p>
<p>People think that all caps are a loud and emphatic tone, and they are not used to reading them, so use them as little as possible.</p>
<p>Use all caps only when writing headlines or when you need to get the user’s attention, such as a prompt to the user before they delete an important file.</p>
<p><strong>Reading on a screen is harder than reading on paper</strong></p>
<p>Use larger fonts on the screen to reduce eye fatigue.</p>
<p>You should divide the text into several blocks and use bullet points, short paragraphs, and pictures.</p>
<p>Increase the contrast between the text and the background. Black text on a white background is the easiest to read.</p>
<p>Make sure the content is worth reading. The reading problem ultimately depends on whether the article itself interests the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term memory is limited (Example: Remember a phone number without pen and paper)</strong></p>
<p>Don’t let people’s memory be in different places, such as reading text or numbers on one page and then entering them on another page. If you do this, they are likely to forget the information and their confidence will suffer.</p>
<p>If you want people to use working memory to remember things, don’t let them do other things before completing the task. Working memory is easily disturbed, and too much sensory input will prevent them from concentrating.</p>
<p>Psychologist Alan Baddeley questioned the 7 plus or minus 2 rule. Baddeley (1986) conducted a lot of research on human memory and information processing. In addition, researchers such as Nelson Cowan (2001) have followed in his footsteps. Research now shows that the “magic number” is actually 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F629de6df-cfe2-4b1a-9e54-5245b8e48334.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;629de6df-cfe2-4b1a-9e54-5245b8e48334.jpg"></p>
<p>It is good to limit the information presented to users to 4 items, but it is not necessary. You can use classification or grouping to display more information.</p>
<p>Display no more than 4 pieces of information per group.</p>
<p>Note that users like to use auxiliary memory aids, such as notes, lists, calendars, and schedules, to reduce their dependence on brain memory.</p>
<p><strong>People are better at processing small chunks of information</strong></p>
<p>Progressive disclosure requires multiple clicks. You may have heard that website design should minimize the number of clicks required for users to get detailed information. But the number of clicks is not important, and people are very willing to click multiple times. In fact, if users can get the right amount of information with each click and are willing to continue to browse the website along the design idea, they will not notice the clicking operation at all.</p>
<p>If you have to choose between making users click and making users think, click more and think less.</p>
<p>Before you use progressive disclosure, be sure to do enough research to figure out what information most users need and when they need it.</p>
<p><strong>How difficult is it to get people’s attention? It depends on how focused they are</strong></p>
<p>As long as you give clear instructions and the task is not too time-consuming, people can concentrate and immerse themselves in it, ignoring other distractions.</p>
<p>People’s subconscious will constantly scan the surrounding environment to see if there is any information that interests them, such as their own name, food, sex, and danger.</p>
<p><strong>The closer people are to the goal, the more motivated they are</strong></p>
<p>The closer people are to the goal, the more motivated they are to complete it, especially when success is in sight.</p>
<p>After achieving the goal, motivation and purchasing power will decrease sharply. This is called the post-reward reset phenomenon. Usually, people have little patience to complete another task.</p>
<p>The risk of losing customers is highest when rewards are achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Human sociality: The upper limit of the number of people in the “strong relationship circle” is 150</strong></p>
<p>When designing a product that focuses on community relations, consider whether the interaction is designed for strong relationships or weak relationships.</p>
<p>If you are designing for strong relationships, you need to design some features that allow users to get close to each other, so that they can connect and get to know each other in the circle.</p>
<p>If you are designing for weak relationships, don’t make it the main purpose for users in the social network to directly contact or get close to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Human sensory system: Everyone has seven emotions and six desires</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F170f15f0-9474-4b51-acb2-0ccfb7e38b03.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;170f15f0-9474-4b51-acb2-0ccfb7e38b03.jpg"></p>
<p>The seven emotions of happiness, sadness, contempt, fear, disgust, surprise, and anger are universal and are expressed through facial expressions and body postures.</p>
<p>If you want to communicate with pictures (such as pictures of people on a website), using pictures that express one of the seven emotions is the most effective way to communicate.</p>
<p>People are good at reading these seven basic emotions from photos. People can often tell which emotions are fake, so try to use pictures that look real.</p>
<p>Find out which emotions can infect the target users. In addition to the basic information of users, it is also necessary to clarify and record their psychological conditions, such as which emotions are most infectious or most likely to stimulate various psychological activities of target users.</p>
<p><strong>People always make mistakes, there is no completely fault-tolerant product</strong></p>
<p>To design a product or game that persuades people to take specific actions, you need to understand the subconscious motivations of the target group.</p>
<p>When people tell you the reasons for their specific actions, you should be skeptical. Because decisions are made in the subconscious, they may not know the real reason for their decisions.</p>
<p>Although people make decisions based on certain subconscious factors, they also want to find a reasonable reason for the decision. So you still need to provide users with some reasonable reasons, even if they are not the real reasons that make them make the decision.</p>
<p>When designing game interactions, we often hope that players will act according to our own designs from the perspective of designers. We give players some abilities and hope that they will follow suit. In fact, it is more important to understand the psychology of players, analyze and use the mental model of players, so that the game can become what we want it to be, and players will listen to the “suggestions” of the designer and feel that this is exactly what they want.</p>

    <title>Things About Novice Guidance Testing</title>
    <url>/2019/08/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20190816_28584_828471/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190816/28584_828471.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>For a game, the novice guidance is the first door that players open to the game. Whether the novice guidance is good or not is crucial. Complex and difficult novice guidance can easily “dissuade” newbies, while boring and repetitive novice guidance will make “veterans” feel bored. Both results may lead to player churn during the novice guidance stage, thereby reducing the game’s retention rate.</p>
<p>Therefore, testing the novice guidance is very important. The intuitive feedback from the test can optimize the novice guidance, thereby improving the game’s retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F276e0096-9ffd-44bf-beb5-64b2eb78f1db.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;276e0096-9ffd-44bf-beb5-64b2eb78f1db.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Justice Online Novice Guidance)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The novice guidance of the game mainly bears two “missions”:</p>
<p><strong>The first mission is to enable players to master the main functional gameplay and successfully “get on the road.”</strong></p>
<p>For the mastery of functional gameplay, we need to do a lot of dismantling work before testing, that is, to organize and dismantle all the functional points involved in the current novice guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fe2ea6b56-1c5e-4b2f-968f-e1aca69b19fc.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;e2ea6b56-1c5e-4b2f-968f-e1aca69b19fc.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Novice Guidance)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Novice guidance testing does not end after the player has experienced the novice guidance and asks “Did you learn it?”. For the dismantling of functional points, we need to refine every detail, such as “move”, “dodge”, “skill release”, etc. During the test, we need to carefully confirm whether the player has learned these basic functional points. Not every content that appears for the first time in the game is very important. Basic functional points must be problems that will get stuck if they are not learned, resulting in the inability to continue the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also need to distinguish which ones are worthy of attention and which ones are not so important. For current games, most of the novice guidance is linear, that is, only one point is taught at a time, and the next point is taught after this point is taught, instead of presenting a tree shape. Because if there are too many teaching points at the same time, players will not know what they should learn. Therefore, for linear novice guidance, the order in which various functional points are taught may also be very important. These are all contents that need to be paid attention to in the test.</p>
<p>The dismantling of functional gameplay plays a great role not only in the testing of novice guidance, but also in the analysis of novice node retention. After dismantling the various guidance points in the novice period, we can bury points for these contents in advance. When the game is tested, we can see which node has a higher churn rate through data, so that we can get a more objective result.</p>
<p><strong>Another “mission” of novice guidance is to attract players through high-quality plots, animations, and other content, create a sense of substitution, and thus retain players.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Faec9e1a2-00a9-4747-8744-4750f26fdb95.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;aec9e1a2-00a9-4747-8744-4750f26fdb95.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Meteor Butterfly Sword Novice Guidance)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So when testing, it is not just about whether the player has learned, but also about the attractiveness of the content in the novice stage. Generally speaking, novice guidance mainly makes players feel “bright” through the plot and art quality. Therefore, when conducting tests, we will pay attention to the player’s acceptance of the world view and their evaluation of the art.</p>
<p>If further subdivided, the plot can be broken down into background story, character settings, plot lines, etc., and the art can be broken down into scenes, characters, animations, special effects, etc. However, the breakdown of content is relatively subjective and not as specific as the breakdown of functional gameplay, so it can be carried out according to your own needs.</p>
<p>Novice guidance testing is not necessarily before the game is launched. After the game is launched, we also need to test the novice process. For example, for a major promotion, we hope to introduce a large number of game newbies. For these newbies, is there any problem with our guidance? Or, after the game is launched, some content of the game has actually become a benchmark. In the novice guidance test, do we still need to test these contents? These all need to be adjusted according to specific needs.</p>

    <title>[US Sharing] A First Look at Flink</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190816_28584_828474/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190816/28584_828474.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flink is a stream processing framework. In stream processing, data can usually be regarded as an infinite-capacity pipeline. Every time a message comes in, it is processed. This is a different concept from batch processing. Batch processing usually stores data in a file system and then processes the data.</p>
<p><strong>From this, it can be seen that compared to the batch processing method, the stream processing calculation approach has lower latency and is more suitable for scenarios such as real-time calculation.</strong></p>
<p>So how do we count data in this stream processing framework? In Flink, a variety of windows are provided to help us implement the calculation and statistics of stream data. This article will briefly introduce the concept of windows in Flink.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: cars are constantly passing through a checkpoint from the same direction. We want to count the total number of cars passing through this checkpoint within a period of time. Since the cars are constantly coming, we cannot wait for all the cars to pass through this checkpoint before counting and summing.</p>
<p><strong>So we need to change our thinking and try an accumulation strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Every time a piece of data comes in, we add it to the previous result. In this way, for each input time, an updated record will be obtained:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fc5fdce64-9b36-4fe1-b59a-83a48e0a06ec.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;c5fdce64-9b36-4fe1-b59a-83a48e0a06ec.jpg"></p>
<p>But this cumulative sum may not be what we ultimately want, because it may lose some data during the continuous updating of data. Then we may need to re-describe the problem:</p>
<p><strong>Count the number of cars passing through the checkpoint every minute.</strong></p>
<p>Then we need to count the vehicle data every 60 seconds. This is called a Tumbling window in Flink, as shown in the figure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fd008f363-137a-4332-bc8e-5ccce2bed086.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;d008f363-137a-4332-bc8e-5ccce2bed086.jpg"></p>
<p>As can be seen in the figure, each Tumbling window does not overlap. In some scenarios, we may need a smoother transition method, such as counting the data of the previous 1 minute every 30 seconds. This is a Sliding window, as shown in the figure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2Fb3483fb5-e053-4430-bf8c-0950f8305637.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;b3483fb5-e053-4430-bf8c-0950f8305637.jpg"></p>
<p>Consider another situation. Suppose there are multiple checkpoints, then we can process the data of different checkpoints in parallel according to the different IDs of the checkpoint sensors, as shown in the figure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190816%2F1f256f3b-9a51-463d-8d7d-7d7a00950f9a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190816&#x2F;1f256f3b-9a51-463d-8d7d-7d7a00950f9a.jpg"></p>
<p>The above introduces several different types of windows that use time as the statistical object. These windows can be called Time Windows.</p>
<p>Of course, these windows can also be data-driven (Count Window), such as processing every few words, etc. Understanding Flink’s window mechanism is only a small step in learning Flink. I will introduce more Flink features when I have the opportunity.</p>

    <title>Methods of Game System UI Design</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190823_28584_829556/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, we’ll talk about the UI design of game systems. “Systems” refer to functional modules in the game, such as the guild system in MMOs or the team system in MOBAs.</p>
<p>System design is generally carried out during the mid-stage of game development, when the core gameplay is basically established, and various peripheral systems are gradually added. Systems often imply multiple interfaces and multiple usage scenarios.</p>
<p>Because of the existence of these complex functional modules, there is a difference between interaction designers and visual designers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interaction designers focus on the design of multiple interfaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visual designers focus on the design of single interfaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Facing a complex system, I’ve summarized my experience and will talk about my design methods.</p>
<h2 id="1-Analyze-the-Goal"><a href="#1-Analyze-the-Goal" class="headerlink" title="1. Analyze the Goal"></a>1. Analyze the Goal</h2><p>The goal is still the starting point of the design. It is necessary to clarify the direction before designing. For example, for a game system, the first step is to clarify what the system does and what its core functions are, and to clarify my iteration goals. Secondly, as an interaction designer, I analyze the characteristics of the core users and the user’s behavior path in this system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>Setting design goals is a very important part. The more detailed the goals, the more basis there will be for the subsequent design process.</p>
<h2 id="2-Hierarchy"><a href="#2-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="2. Hierarchy"></a>2. Hierarchy</h2><p>Multiple interfaces mean that the hierarchical relationship between interfaces needs to be sorted out, which is often referred to as information architecture. Sorting out the information architecture seems to be a basic skill, but it is often difficult to do it well.</p>
<p>Under the time constraints of development, it is often required to quickly and accurately sort out the hierarchical relationship. Here, I often use the method of organizing similar functions to sort out the hierarchy.</p>
<p>At the same time, sort out the relationship between the “layer” and “degree” of the information architecture. Addition and subtraction can be used to change the hierarchical relationship of functions, and ensure that information is not lost.</p>
<h2 id="3-Interface-Design"><a href="#3-Interface-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. Interface Design"></a>3. Interface Design</h2><p>The single interface design mentioned here refers to the information layout design in a single interface. After sorting out the hierarchical relationship, the remaining is the design of how to display information in a single interface.</p>
<p>There are many design forms in a single interface, and various layouts have their own advantages and disadvantages. Designers need to choose the most suitable layout. The core point is to figure out the information weight of the current interface. The following are several common information layout forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organizational information:</strong> Commonly used in skill talent trees, leaderboards, etc., emphasizing the relationship and order between information.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F6fb89720-0d3c-4565-a42d-d01625ce0aa1.jpg/size/" alt="Organizational Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spatial information:</strong> Commonly used in navigation, maps, etc., emphasizing the dimensional hierarchy of information.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F8503964f-2a1c-49bc-b425-8a46b756e67b.jpg/size/" alt="Spatial Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetrical information:</strong> Commonly used in matching, confrontation, etc., emphasizing the corresponding relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2Fb8c8f973-fc3f-4d2e-a05f-0d74d97335a7.jpg/size/" alt="Symmetrical Information Example"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>List information:</strong> Commonly used in stores and other situations, emphasizing the subordinate relationship and the relationship of parallel systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F4e8412e1-044f-4924-8fa5-848deb0de84a.jpg/size/" alt="List Information Example"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other types of interfaces, which will not be repeated here.</p>
<h2 id="4-Integrate-with-the-Game-Worldview"><a href="#4-Integrate-with-the-Game-Worldview" class="headerlink" title="4. Integrate with the Game Worldview"></a>4. Integrate with the Game Worldview</h2><p>After satisfying the functions, I will evaluate which interfaces focus on function and which interfaces focus on presentation. Integrating with the worldview is a test of the designer’s creativity. Often, referring to real-world affairs will be of great help to the design. Experience the world outside the game, collect interesting creative materials, and try to transform them into UI.</p>

    <title>A Preliminary Exploration of Nijigen Mobile Games</title>
    <url>/2019/08/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20190823_28584_829557/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190823/28584_829557.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, some blockbuster mobile games with Nijigen themes have appeared in the mobile game market. This article provides a brief summary and introduction to the core-oriented Nijigen mobile games among them.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Nijigen"><a href="#What-is-Nijigen" class="headerlink" title="What is Nijigen?"></a>What is Nijigen?</h2><p>The cultural concept of Nijigen mainly comes from Japanese ACG culture. It originally refers to the two-dimensional world&#x2F;dimension in ACG (manga and animation characters are displayed in two-dimensional space), and later gradually extended to refer to the Japanese ACG style and culture.</p>
<p>Currently, the game industry tends to define the group covered by Japanese anime-style animation, comics, novels, and games as the Nijigen group: in fact, Nijigen is the group covered by the four words ACGN. These people are immersed in the virtual worlds depicted by ACGN, and we call them the Nijigen group —- Zhang Feng, Vice President of Bilibili, at the 2016 CJ.</p>
<h2 id="Nijigen-Mobile-Game-Market"><a href="#Nijigen-Mobile-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="Nijigen Mobile Game Market"></a>Nijigen Mobile Game Market</h2><p>The domestic Nijigen mobile game market is relatively mature: around 2012, Nijigen mobile games began to appear in the mobile game market, such as <em>Guns Girl Z</em> and <em>Million Arthur</em>. After that, the market continued to develop. Around 2015, <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>, <em>Fate&#x2F;Grand Order</em>, and <em>Onmyoji</em> were launched, and the Nijigen mobile game market entered a period of explosive growth. Currently, using “Nijigen” to search on Taptap, the search results have exceeded 7000 related games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F340dc653-60a9-4bfc-b984-8db21f8fce78.jpg/size/" alt="Nijigen Games on TapTap"></p>
<p>Nijigen game market performance: In 2018, the growth rate of the Nijigen mobile game market was higher than the overall level, and the market growth rate declined year-on-year. It is speculated that the reason is first, the impact of the license limit, and second, there are no new sustained blockbusters (the top three Nijigen mobile games in revenue in 18 were <em>Onmyoji</em>, <em>FGO</em>, and <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>, all of which have been online for 2-3 years). Considering that <em>Arknights</em> performed well in 2019, it is expected that the market data of Nijigen mobile games in 2019 will increase.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F196438bb-8325-4651-9097-f3885ed9e022.jpg/size/" alt="Nijigen Mobile Game Market Size"></p>

<p>Data Source: Gamma Data (CNG)</p>
<h2 id="Core-Oriented-Nijigen-Games"><a href="#Core-Oriented-Nijigen-Games" class="headerlink" title="Core-Oriented Nijigen Games"></a>Core-Oriented Nijigen Games</h2><p>Nijigen game products can be further classified based on their audience (such as male&#x2F;female-oriented, core&#x2F;mass-oriented). Due to space limitations, this article mainly discusses relatively core-oriented Nijigen products.</p>
<p>What are core-oriented Nijigen games: Nijigen games that are popular with the core Nijigen group and otaku can be classified as core-oriented products (such as <em>FGO</em>, <em>Arknights</em>, <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>, <em>Girls’ Frontline</em>, and <em>Forever 7th Capital</em>). In addition to excellent art design, these games hit the core group’s moe points in character design, world view, plot, and gameplay, while the numerical experience is designed to be more restrained. It should be noted that works with Japanese anime IPs are not necessarily core-oriented products.</p>
<h2 id="Characteristics-of-Core-Oriented-Products"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Core-Oriented-Products" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Core-Oriented Products"></a>Characteristics of Core-Oriented Products</h2><p><strong>Heavy on Content:</strong> Players have emotional investment in the game world and character design. Core-oriented Nijigen products have high standards in art, character design, CV, plot, world view, etc., with innovative gameplay and weak numerical experience. Players are first attracted by the first impressions such as CV and art design. After in-depth experience, they feel recognized and emotionally invested in the characters and plot in the game. Then there are behaviors such as氪金 (kējīn - spending money, usually on gacha), self-propagation, and re-creation (research, cosplay, fan creation).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F169102b0-5fb8-46cf-9a49-1962b45e6a00.jpg/size/" alt="Emphasis on Story, and Characters"></p>
<p><strong>Loose In-Game Social Interaction:</strong> It is unlikely to form a strong in-game social group similar to MMOs centered on fixed teams, mentors and apprentices, and guilds (for example, <em>FGO</em> does not have private chats, and players need to find friends on forums and Weibo). However, the social atmosphere formed based on KOL creation, self-propagation, and circle interaction and discussion outside the game is not weak. Players further meet their emotional needs and identity needs. Even if some players leave the game, they will continue to pay attention to fan output, forming a potential return atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Can Form a Cultural Circle and Drive the Development of Pan-Entertainment Products:</strong> Based on players’ recognition of the game’s character design, world view and other content, Nijigen products have great expandability, and pan-entertainment products of the same IP will also be sought after by core players. Extend the period of players’ emotional investment and form good product stickiness.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190823%2F003d74b9-8385-475c-acb4-4752d482f74e.png/size/" alt="Cultural Circle Example"></p>

    <title>Games and Gamification</title>

</blockquote>
<p>Gamification is a concept that has gradually gained attention in recent years. Some mini-games have also appeared in many Internet products, such as Alibaba’s Ant series, Taobao’s mini-games, and so on.</p>
<p>But whether it is in the gaming industry or Non-Gaming industries, many people often have some questions, what is gamification? Is adding mini-games to non-game products gamification?</p>
<h2 id="The-Concept-of-Gamification"><a href="#The-Concept-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="The Concept of Gamification"></a>The Concept of Gamification</h2><p>First, what is a game?</p>
<p>Everyone has their own understanding of this question. In academia, some scholars have proposed a short and precise definition of the game: a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>Traditional games are mainly used for entertainment purposes. They generate fun by setting up some obstacles and having users solve them, achieving the purpose of entertainment.</p>
<p>The concept of gamification is no longer limited to traditional games themselves, but can be combined with other non-game factors, and game concepts can be used without restrictions.</p>
<p>Gamification, also known as Gamification, was proposed by Deterding in 2011. One early, and widely accepted definition, of Gamification is:</p>
<p>Gamification refers to the use of game elements in non-game systems to enhance user experience and engagement.</p>
<p>In practical applications, gamification can take two forms: it can either adopt some game elements in a non-game system, or it can be a complete game with a certain non-game purpose.</p>
<h2 id="Gamification-Elements"><a href="#Gamification-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Elements"></a>Gamification Elements</h2><p>Simply adding a mini-game does not constitute real gamification. Gamification uses game thinking and design elements to solve problems and motivate users.</p>
<p>Game elements include game design principles, methods, game frameworks, game mechanics, specific interface designs, and so on.</p>
<p>The flexible use and integration of these elements into non-game systems is the gamification method.</p>
<p>For example, the father of Pokémon, the famous Japanese game producer and president of Game Freak, Satoshi Tajiri (たじりさとし), proposed a concept in 1996 when “Pokémon Red” and “Pokémon Green” became popular all over the world - the fun of the game has four major elements: collection, cultivation, interaction, and exploration.</p>
<p>These elements can greatly stimulate users’ interest and desire to participate. Integrating these elements into the design of non-game systems can also greatly improve user engagement. While users are performing game behaviors, certain information is subtly implanted and user behavior is shaped.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Gamification"><a href="#Application-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="Application of Gamification"></a>Application of Gamification</h2><p>In recent years, gamification has been gradually applied in many fields such as education, business, information research, human-computer interaction, and health.</p>
<p>There are many examples of gamification in the field of education. Game elements can enhance the fun of learning and increase people’s initiative to complete learning tasks, and can also increase student participation and enhance communication between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of gamification in early childhood education is particularly prominent. Because children themselves have characteristics such as difficulty concentrating and being easily attracted by fun elements, the combination of gamification and teaching can significantly improve teaching effects.</p>
<p>Some teachers use gamification concepts when designing classroom processes, such as setting course rewards, combining game links, and so on.</p>
<p>In the business field, some studies explore the application of gamification management in enterprise management.</p>
<p>Gamification management evokes achievement motivation, improves participation and initiative, and creates a win-win situation for enterprises and employees from three aspects: incentive, interaction, and fairness. Some game mechanisms such as points, badges, and levels are introduced as reputation and incentive mechanisms for employees. Some successful entrepreneurs also use gamification as the core highlight of their products to provide services, such as Codecademy, which uses gamification to teach users programming.</p>
<p>And, in the field of health initiatives, gamification has also been applied.</p>
<p>Gamification can make people more involved in and responsible for health-related decisions, and can also improve the performance of healthcare professionals. It is specifically applied in sports, nutrition, weight control, medication compliance, and personal hygiene.</p>
<p>Some children’s hospitals have also adopted the concept of gamification in the design of the entire medical treatment process, such as providing some games that combine medical knowledge in the dentist’s waiting room, assigning tasks to children to complete medical treatment, and receiving rewards. Some necessary medical knowledge is popularized through some gamified forms, and children’s tension and anxiety are also relieved.</p>
<p>With the development of industry technology and emerging concepts, games have gradually transcended the limitations of traditional games and are used in all walks of life. We game practitioners can find many gamified applications outside of games and in life, which is also a reflection and inspiration for game design concepts and elements.</p>

    <title>How Game Camera Angles Affect User Experience (Part Two)</title>
    <url>/2019/08/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20190829_28584_830277/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190829/28584_830277.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the previous article, “How Game Camera Angles Affect User Experience,” we introduced the classification of game camera angles (2D, 2.5D, Traditional 3D, Action 3D, Free Mode) and the parameters of camera settings (camera rotation sensitivity, perspective angle, viewing angle, FPS value, defocus and shading, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Camera angle and target locking are two inseparable game issues.</strong></p>
<p>Locking refers to the selection of attack targets and the locking mechanism, including free unlocking mechanism, various conditional priority locking mechanisms (such as nearest, lowest health, most recently attacked), intelligent locking mechanism, and various unlocking mechanisms.</p>
<p>Locking is closely related to the camera angle. For example, if a player wants to adjust the follow rate of the attack camera, they must first confirm that the game locking state is in the unlocked attack mode, such as: <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword mobile</em>. Today, we will introduce two parts of the game’s locking part - intelligent locking and manual locking.</p>
<h2 id="I-Intelligent-Locking-Locking-Mechanisms-and-Principles"><a href="#I-Intelligent-Locking-Locking-Mechanisms-and-Principles" class="headerlink" title="I. Intelligent Locking - Locking Mechanisms and Principles"></a>I. Intelligent Locking - Locking Mechanisms and Principles</h2><p>In some games that can be intelligently locked, there are usually some locking mechanisms to choose from. When there are many attackable targets, a certain type of target will be selected for attack according to a specific mechanism&#x2F;principle. For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190829%2Fb2417dea-04a5-4d1a-9e2c-9247f0451954.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190829&#x2F;b2417dea-04a5-4d1a-9e2c-9247f0451954.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>1. Prioritize attacking the unit with the lowest health</strong></p>
<p>When many attacking units gather, prioritize attacking the unit with the lowest health to facilitate harvesting residual health and improving combat performance.</p>
<p><strong>2. Prioritize attacking the nearest unit</strong></p>
<p>When many attacking units gather, you can prioritize attacking the nearest unit to facilitate getting rid of close-range attacks and pursuits.</p>
<p><strong>3. Prioritize attacking bosses&#x2F;minions</strong></p>
<p>When you can attack both bosses and minions at the same time, you can switch the locked target and prioritize attacking minions or bosses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190829%2F3a68b554-1138-4fd1-99f3-2b0f739cc804.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190829&#x2F;3a68b554-1138-4fd1-99f3-2b0f739cc804.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>4. Prioritize attacking soldiers&#x2F;towers</strong></p>
<p>Commonly used in MOBA games, switch the attack target of minions&#x2F;towers.</p>
<h2 id="II-Manual-Locking-Position-of-Locking-Buttons-and-Unlock-Function"><a href="#II-Manual-Locking-Position-of-Locking-Buttons-and-Unlock-Function" class="headerlink" title="II. Manual Locking - Position of Locking Buttons and Unlock Function"></a>II. Manual Locking - Position of Locking Buttons and Unlock Function</h2><p>If the lock button is on the left, you cannot drag the joystick and switch the locked target at the same time, which is suitable for games that focus on skill attack combinations; if the lock button is on the right, you cannot release skills and switch the locked target at the same time, which is suitable for games that require frequent movement and dodging.</p>
<p>In the design of the game, different players have different pursuits for the game, especially in games that combine PVE and PVP. Therefore, in order to improve the user experience, some games can adjust the UI position of the lock button according to player needs, such as <em>Meteor Swarm Legend mobile</em>, which can be locked by touch screen, top right corner lock, and top left corner lock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190829%2F424081d5-ad0b-47ba-9968-c964664a6692.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190829&#x2F;424081d5-ad0b-47ba-9968-c964664a6692.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190829%2Fd6d98841-0362-4c79-b475-4e426f962a1e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190829&#x2F;d6d98841-0362-4c79-b475-4e426f962a1e.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be noted that, as game practitioners, we can understand the definition of some locking mechanisms and understand the applicable situations of some UI buttons in different positions. However, as players, most players need default locking settings that suit their minds and feel, rather than adjusting and finding the most suitable buttons for themselves in the process of studying definitions&#x2F;continuously practicing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to set different default lock buttons according to different games and different gameplays.</p>

    <title>Design Seeds and Game Interaction Design</title>
    <url>/2019/08/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20190903_28584_830849/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190903/28584_830849.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interaction design is not created out of thin air, especially in games. A unified design style can bring a better gaming experience to players and help them immerse themselves in the game itself. At the same time, a design with a source can effectively enhance the persuasiveness of the product and improve design efficiency in terms of performance.</p>
<p>In a 2015 GDC presentation, <em>Hearthstone</em> Senior UI Designer Derek Sakamoto introduced the concept of a design Seed, used to guide design style and concepts to make the game more complete, vivid, and consistent with the world, creating an immersive user interface.</p>
<p>For Derek, a Seed can be an idea, a picture, a movie, or a song, which allows the team to understand the direction of the project.</p>
<p>For <em>Hearthstone</em>, their concepts ranged from the early <em>Warcraft</em> elements of ice and fire, the map adventure elements of Azeroth, adventure book elements, forest elements, and so on. Eventually, they found the design concept of the box, and then developed a series of interesting designs, including the concepts of keys and trees. Then they thought that the box should be on a table, and what kind of environment should the table be in? Continuing the creative divergence, they got the concept of playing <em>Hearthstone</em> in a <em>Warcraft</em> tavern, which became richer and richer, and led to today’s <em>Hearthstone</em>.</p>
<p>So how do you find the Seed? Derek didn’t give a clear method, but he summarized the following experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seeds are hard to find directly, unless you’re very lucky or talented;</strong></li>
<li><strong>You should start looking in the early stages of the project, it can make project development smoother;</strong></li>
<li><strong>It can make everything better;</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you want to make an attractive and unique game, you must find the Seed.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back at the design of <em>Hearthstone</em>, from the simple flat design at the beginning, then adding 3D, adding physics, adding magic, gradually improving and deducing, and finally getting the current UI main interface.</p>
<p>Once the Seed is determined, we need to branch out through the Seed to produce many designs that conform to the theme, and even expand and extend the Seed itself. From the design and copywriting in the battlefield, the design of various peripheral systems (shop, social, etc.), and various system pages such as battle settlement, the core concept of this seed will be implemented.</p>
<p>When looking for a seed, generally starting from the positioning of the product, consider various factors, such as innovation and applicability. Just like <em>Hearthstone</em>, after determining the seed of the box, it is not convenient to design proposals such as exploring the big world. At the same time, it will also have a certain impact on scalability and some game settings themselves. Therefore, for designers, finding the Seed is only the beginning of the design, not the end. From seed to flowering and fruiting is also very important.</p>
<p>For example, in the design, in order to fill the table, the designer added some additional Easter eggs, allowing players to pass the time while playing cards and trigger various effects, giving players a different surprise.</p>
<p>In the latest Dalaran Heist adventure mode, there is a level to go to the tavern to modify the deck, which is in line with the game’s setting of the tavern as a casual and relaxing feeling.</p>

    <title>Consumer Psychology and Games: A Few Thoughts (Part Two)</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190905_28584_831253/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous article, “Consumer Psychology and Games: A Few Thoughts,” mainly introduced some concepts, origins, and development of consumer psychology. This article shares some research on consumer psychology and games.</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-Psychology-and-Games"><a href="#Consumer-Psychology-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="Consumer Psychology and Games"></a>Consumer Psychology and Games</h2><p>In fact, foreign researchers have conducted a lot of research on games and consumer psychology, which to some extent proves that the popularity of games has also promoted the development of the game industry. However, there is relatively less research in China, which may provide less reference for the domestic game industry.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the consumption of games is indeed very similar to some of our traditional consumption, but there are also some differences. The first is that game products are all virtual, just a string of code, but they do have value. The “Unrestricted” weapons in <em>Fantasy Westward Journey (梦幻西游)</em> are the best example.</p>
<p>Second, game consumption can improve character attributes, which not only satisfies the needs of the character, but also is an extension of the consumer’s self. This has never appeared in traditional consumption.</p>
<h2 id="Consumption-Motivation"><a href="#Consumption-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Consumption Motivation"></a>Consumption Motivation</h2><p>Let’s go back to the very first question.</p>
<p><em>Why aren’t your players buying your costumes and appearances anymore?</em></p>
<p>This involves the consumption motivation in the game.</p>
<p>The consumption motivation for appearances in games is obviously driven by the purchasing motivation that primarily pursues aesthetics.</p>
<p>Game players often pursue the aesthetic experience of the game item’s shape, color, style, and special effects. Costume items, mount items, pet items, weapon items, etc., can all stimulate the consumption behavior of game players through the pursuit of beauty.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the most important motivation - aesthetics - low price is another consumption motivation for appearance items.</p>
<p>After all, whether in the real world or the virtual world, good quality and low price are the eternal pursuit of consumers. If the game has discount promotions for a period of time, the revenue during this period is often higher than other periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190905%2Ff51d2aec-dcb7-44f2-a573-3941f9b0e34e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190905&#x2F;f51d2aec-dcb7-44f2-a573-3941f9b0e34e.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Justice Online’s (逆水寒)</em> newly released [Lu Ran Fu Qu (露染芙蕖)] was sold at a 40% discount in the first two weeks. Instead of 688 or 520, it only cost 100+. With a novel design and full details, it can be regarded as a model work that grasps the consumer’s aesthetics and low-price motivation, and it must have sold a lot.</p>
<p>So the answer to the previous question is, either you made it too ugly, or you priced it too high. As for how to design and price, there is a lot of room for creativity.</p>
<h2 id="Influencing-Factors-of-Consumption-Behavior"><a href="#Influencing-Factors-of-Consumption-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Influencing Factors of Consumption Behavior"></a>Influencing Factors of Consumption Behavior</h2><p><em>Why did I spend so much money on the game this month?</em></p>
<p>So the question is, why did you spend so much? First, we need to consider basic demographic information, such as age.</p>
<p>Chen (2010) previously stated that younger players still have stronger gaming intentions and more gaming behaviors than adult players. But it’s understandable that young people have strong intentions, but they still can’t beat the big spenders.</p>
<p>Although young people can invest more time and energy, the money they spend in the game is still relatively small (Qiu Junzheng, 2010).</p>
<p>Another example is gender. Generally speaking, men prefer online games, and they will invest more time, energy, and money in online games (Chen, 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190905%2Fc0cdb1fd-9ce8-4c25-b2cd-286a73230894.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190905&#x2F;c0cdb1fd-9ce8-4c25-b2cd-286a73230894.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition to the players, the characteristics of the game itself are also important influencing factors.</p>
<p>For example, from the most expressive game screen performance, the research of Luo Shaokang, Wang Zhijian, and Fang Wenchang (2005) shows that the graphics are the key factor affecting the player’s first game behavior, but players have significant differences in their evaluation of the graphics quality of the same type of game.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not difficult to understand. It’s like asking a purely three-dimensional person to play a game with a two-dimensional art style, their evaluation may be very low, but it’s completely different for happy two-dimensional otakus.</p>
<p>Finally, social interaction is also a very important aspect, especially for MMORPGs. Social activities, social capital, social norms, etc. can actually be reflected in the game.</p>
<p>In traditional consumption, although there is a certain degree of social interaction between customers, its breadth and depth cannot be compared with the social interaction in online games. In the game, guilds or gangs are a very critical part of an MMORPG, and players who have played such games must have a deep understanding of this. Battles between different guilds, or comparisons between friends in the same guild, are important factors affecting customer consumption.</p>
<h2 id="The-Last-Question"><a href="#The-Last-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Last Question"></a>The Last Question</h2><p>So there is one last question from the previous article that remains to be solved.</p>
<p><em>It’s the game’s anniversary, what gift should I buy for my in-game significant other?</em></p>
<p>Wake up, you don’t have an in-game significant other!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190905%2F708d3934-22c5-4aae-9a68-993c834619ed.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190905&#x2F;708d3934-22c5-4aae-9a68-993c834619ed.jpg"></p>

<p>I believe everyone has had the following experiences:</p>
<p>You finish a day’s work and open a video website, and the banner shows exactly the show you want to watch.</p>
<p>Having just received your salary at the beginning of the month, you can’t help but open a shopping app, and the scrolling ads on the homepage remind you that it’s time to splurge.</p>
<p>Personalized recommendation systems that cater to each individual bring “understanding” and precise recommendations. Today, we will briefly introduce the recommendation technology behind them.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Definition"><a href="#Problem-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Problem Definition"></a>Problem Definition</h2><p><strong>Recommendation problem:</strong> Implement a utility function that automatically predicts a user’s degree of liking for a certain item.</p>
<h2 id="Algorithm-Classification"><a href="#Algorithm-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm Classification"></a>Algorithm Classification</h2><p>The industry and academia have proposed many algorithms for the implementation of recommender systems.

<h3 id="Other-Non-traditional-Algorithms"><a href="#Other-Non-traditional-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Other Non-traditional Algorithms"></a>Other Non-traditional Algorithms</h3><p><strong>Learning to Rank</strong></p>
<p>Understand the recommendation problem as a ranking problem. The loss function can be established from the perspective of points, pairs, and lists.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity</strong></p>
<p>SimRank: Calculate the similarity matrix based on bipartite graph theory, and use regression or MAB methods to combine the similarity matrices of different levels (such as metadata, user behavior data) as the final similarity matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Learning</strong></p>
<p>Can be used for collaborative filtering methods or content-based recommendation algorithms</p>
<p><strong>Social and Trust-based Recommender</strong></p>
<p>Can be combined with collaborative filtering algorithms to introduce social relationships in similarity calculation; can also be combined with machine learning methods to introduce social relationships in regularization functions.</p>
<p>Can use demographic methods for classification recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Page Optimization</strong></p>
<p>Mainly consider the optimization between the organization of the page and the distribution of user attention in different positions on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Tensor Factorization &amp; Factorization Machine</strong></p>
<p>In multi-dimensional scenarios such as user-resource-tags, data can be represented by tensors (usually very sparse). Tensor methods are used to decompose the tensors into low-dimensional space, and then methods in low-dimensional space (such as the bipartite graph-based methods mentioned earlier) are used for recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>MAB Explore&#x2F;Exploit</strong></p>
<p>Use the Bandit algorithm in the Multi-armed bandit problem to solve the Explore&#x2F;Exploit problem and the selection problem of different recommendation strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Alibaba - Real-time Recommendation Algorithm SWING Based on Graph Structure</strong></p>
<p>Main idea: Solve the problem of weak denoising ability of traditional point-based similarity algorithms through the SWING algorithm, and this method is more sensitive to changes in network structure.</p>

However, since recommender systems involve knowledge of data mining, machine learning, etc., and recommender systems are an important application of data mining and machine learning, and recommender systems are also in the category of artificial intelligence when they are closer to larger fields, many scholars who do recommendation also turn their attention to conferences in data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Therefore, if you want to pay attention to the frontier of recommender systems, we need to pay attention not only to the annual conference of recommender systems, but also to other conferences related to recommendations.</p>

    <title>Exciting Data Visualization</title>
    <url>/2019/09/06/netease-ux-articles/news_20190917_28584_833017/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190917/28584_833017.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data visualization has always been a topic I’m very interested in, although I’ve completely forgotten when I started to be attracted to it. The charm of data lies in its truthful recording of us; our good or bad is just an accumulation of numbers here. Real data is also chaotic, because we ourselves, reality itself, is chaotic.</p>
<p>To make the chaotic reality clear and simple, this is visualization.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Do-We-Need-Data-Visualization"><a href="#Why-Do-We-Need-Data-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Why Do We Need Data Visualization?"></a>Why Do We Need Data Visualization?</h2><p>“Data is too boring, I don’t want to look at it at all,” and “It’s so complicated, I can’t understand it at all” are the first reasons why we need to visualize data. Due to the limited cognitive ability of human beings, our brains are inherently unable to process a bunch of pure numbers. We need to transform numbers into something we can understand and be more sensitive to – graphics.</p>
<p>Transforming the slow reasoning and calculation process into objects that can be intuitively felt; understanding this, you have mastered all of visualization design. With a little practice, you can become a great data analyst.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Visualize-Data"><a href="#How-to-Visualize-Data" class="headerlink" title="How to Visualize Data"></a>How to Visualize Data</h2><h3 id="Basic-Elements-of-Visualization"><a href="#Basic-Elements-of-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Basic Elements of Visualization"></a>Basic Elements of Visualization</h3><p>As early as 1967, French cartographer Jacques Bertin summarized and classified people’s cognitive abilities and characteristics of graphic symbols. This research result has also been widely recognized. In the book <em>Semiology of Graphics</em>, Jacques not only discovered our sensitivity to different visual variables, but also explained in detail the types of information that different symbols can carry. This analytical theory has also become the basic principle of most data visualizations.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, our perception of graphics is divided into seven dimensions: position, size, shape, value, hue, orientation, and texture. Each visual variable has its applicable data type, and there are also differences in readability. For example, different hues can represent different variables, but when the number of hue types exceeds 20, they can no longer be quickly identified; hues can well represent categories, but cannot express sequential relationships.</p>
<p>The basis of data visualization is to use visual variables reasonably to display different types of information. Whether it is a simple Bar Chart or a beautifully named Nightingale Rose Chart, this theory can be used to analyze its design principles and rationality. When we design new visualization solutions, we also need to use these elements flexibly.</p>
<h3 id="Interesting-Charts"><a href="#Interesting-Charts" class="headerlink" title="Interesting Charts"></a>Interesting Charts</h3><p>In our work, we often build a Dashboard by using existing charts to complete simple data visualization. Therefore, understanding the types and applicable scenarios of existing charts is the first step.</p>
<p>There are many types of charts, and it is impossible to cover them all here. Interested friends can visit some visualization tool websites, which will have detailed explanations and organization. Here are a few I know.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AntV Chart Usage Manual</strong>, visualization tool; it organizes a relatively complete introduction and usage scenarios of basic charts;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tableau Visualization Library</strong>, a very famous and easy-to-use data analysis tool; the official website provides many real data visualization cases, no longer a single chart, but a combination of various charts to tell facts; you can directly interact on the chart, dig data;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gapminder</strong>, a visualization tool created by the famous Swedish data analysis professor Hans Rosling, the prototype is his research tool when he gave a TED Talk; Grandpa Hans left the world in 2017, but he used data visualization to show us the footprint of mankind in the pursuit of happiness, using a playable visualization chart to show the change of time very intuitively and vividly;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Excite-Your-Audience"><a href="#Excite-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Excite Your Audience"></a>Excite Your Audience</h3><p>How to make the chaotic reality clear and simple is what we need to pay attention to when doing visualization; but more importantly, we need to clarify the purpose of visualization. In fact, visualization is only a part of the data analysis workflow. When we need to use visualization tools, there must be a need for data analysis and presentation first. So, what we want to tell the “audience” through visualization becomes very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to prove a certain point, visualization can deceive the audience.</p>
<h3 id="Avoid-Bad-Illusions"><a href="#Avoid-Bad-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Bad Illusions"></a>Avoid Bad Illusions</h3><p>This is a point that I often find to be criticized by sharers in many data visualization conferences. What is good visualization, and how to use visual variables reasonably to display your information?</p>
<p>The first negative example is the Piechart that everyone likes very much. In many cases, Piechart cannot display information very efficiently. The reason is that pie charts often focus people’s vision on the angle change of the center, but people’s ability to perceive angles is relatively poor. As shown in the figure below, it is difficult for you to tell which is the largest color block in the three pie charts.</p>
<p>However, when we transform it into a barchart, it becomes very clear. This is because vision is extremely sensitive to position information. When we look at a barchart, our vision will naturally compare the positions of the endpoints, and we don’t even need to think more.</p>
<p>The second example, worse than Piechart, is 3D Piechart. As shown below, this is a slide from Apple’s press conference. You will find that the 19.5% part in the picture looks larger than the 21.2% part. There are also many analyses on the Internet about the misleading charts that appeared in Apple’s presentations over the years. If you are interested, you can search for it.</p>
<p>So the second point to note is that we need to use 3D cautiously. People are not sensitive to 3D information, and this will increase the cognitive burden on the audience.</p>
<p>Third, please ensure that the starting point of the vertical axis of the Barchart is the origin. As shown in the figure below, the difference between the two in the chart on the left seems to be multiple, but when we restore the starting point to zero, the difference is actually very small. The reason for this misleading is that we are comparing the difference between the two through Barchart, and the chart on the left incorrectly magnifies this difference. Therefore, before doing visualization, you must first be clear about what we want to express.</p>
<h3 id="Tell-Your-Story"><a href="#Tell-Your-Story" class="headerlink" title="Tell Your Story"></a>Tell Your Story</h3><p>Fundamentally, charts are actually comparing sizes. Even if it can be displayed clearly, you will not be able to remember their relationship and numbers for a long time. What is really left is the speaker’s point of view, your image of objective things, and your judgment on current decisions.</p>
<p>Minard was a pioneer in presenting engineering and statistical information in graphical form. His most famous work, “<em>Figurative Map of the successive losses in men of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812-1813</em>“, depicts the losses suffered by Napoleon’s army after leaving the Polish-Russian border. The chart shows six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops, distance, temperature, longitude and latitude, direction of movement, and time-location relationship. The number of troops is represented by the bandwidth, and one millimeter represents ten thousand people; beige represents the process of the army going to Russia, and black represents the process of retreating from Russia.</p>
<p>This chart fully demonstrates the historical event of Waterloo. Perhaps you had no concept of this war before, but in just a few seconds, you can feel its tragedy from the chart. You don’t need to know any of the numbers, the graph itself has conveyed its content to you.</p>
<p>Therefore, exciting visualization not only needs to clearly show the data, but also to express the content you want the “audience” to pay attention to; this may be a potential problem, it may be the cause of a certain phenomenon, or it may be a bloody fact; what is truly shocking is the story you tell through visualization.</p>
<h3 id="Ending-Hans-Rosling"><a href="#Ending-Hans-Rosling" class="headerlink" title="Ending - Hans Rosling"></a>Ending - Hans Rosling</h3><p>Speaking of which, I’m almost finished. Of course, there are still many details in visualization, which I don’t know much about, and I hope to continue to explore. Finally, I would like to share a popular data analyst, Hans Rosling. Hans Rosling’s most famous speech was when he used 120,000 data points to explain the development of 200 countries in 200 years in 4 minutes. He tried to prove whether human society is moving towards a healthier and richer direction. He uses real data to let the audience understand the answers to macroscopic propositions, and he uses visualization to vividly tell you “the world is actually like this”.</p>
<p><em>“When Hans speaks, I can see the ‘Aha moment’ on people’s faces. He can break through the mystery in an easy way.” Said Melinda Gates, Bill Gates’ wife and co-founder of the Gates Foundation.</em></p>

    <title>Are Physiological Measurement Tools Really Reliable in Game User Research?</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20190917_28584_833066/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190917/28584_833066.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a game user experience researcher, in practical work, you must be more or less soul-tortured by Party A (products, planning, etc.).</p>
<p><em>“The information collected by your user research is all subjective feedback from players. Is it reliable?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The player said that he thinks it is fun here. Are you sure he is not lying?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is there any more objective player experience?”</em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2Fa12d6c7f-ac1f-4b3f-bc40-bc23964e65a6.jpg/size/" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Therefore, the helpless UE students began to look for various physiological indicator tools that can support the player’s experience, such as EEG, heart rate, eye movement, and so on.</p>
<p>So, are these objective physiological indicator tools really more reliable than the subjective feedback that UE students have worked so hard to collect?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2F26103fd9-b49a-45d2-81de-595ef09392ee.jpg/size/" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at EEG first. One of the main tools of neuroscience, a hot topic in scientific research in recent years.</p>
<p>The field of user research has also set off a wave of EEG research. I believe that many students have seen cases of using EEG to analyze the game experience process.</p>
<p>“The EEG waves that reflect excitement here reach a peak, indicating XXXX”. Similar remarks are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Then, let’s just open a neuroscience paper and find its method section (as shown below).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2F343fcd64-58d1-4668-887b-d2b971377eb9.jpg/size/" alt="Image"></p>
<p>It is not difficult for everyone to find that in any academic research using EEG as an indicator, the subjects (participants in the experiment) need to perform dozens or even hundreds of trials with the same content. Because the noise of the EEG signal is very large, it needs to be superimposed and averaged to allow the real signal in the EEG to break away from the noise signal.</p>
<p>Looking back at the EEG research in the game, can the EEG fluctuations that reflect the corresponding emotions they obtain really obtain the real and objective experience of the player as they wish?</p>
<p>The answer is definitely no. First of all, in academic research using EEG, the picture stimulus materials are often color blocks with a gray background, and even when using complex graphics such as human faces, the hair information on the face needs to be removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2Fa9e77db0-67d5-40b9-9d41-639efab9ffbc.jpg/size/" alt="Image"></p>
<p>During the game experience, the visual stimulation felt by the player must be very complex, and the EEG signals reflecting the player’s emotions or experience are wrapped in various noisy signals. At the current level of technology, the EEG signals collected while playing games are basically meaningless.</p>
<p>Secondly, assuming that the EEG signal reflecting the player’s emotional information can stand out in dozens or even hundreds of superpositions and averages, then the problem comes, let the player play dozens or hundreds of times the same game content, for example, run a track dozens or even hundreds of times in a racing game (regardless of how much time it takes). Is the physiological indicator we get really the player’s experience of the game? Compared with it, it contains the player’s impatience, repetitive boredom, and many other emotions.</p>
<p>Finally, just let the player play the game a few times. Can’t you get meaningful EEG signals? Most of the eye-catching game EEG studies do this. In the editor’s experience, there has never been an EEG study with only a few trials in neuroscience papers. If there are big names in related fields among the readers, you are welcome to slap me in the face.</p>
<p>Therefore, the editor believes that at the current level of development of EEG signal acquisition technology, if someone applies EEG acquisition technology to the field of game user research, this person is mostly a liar.</p>
<p>So, what about the other two common physiological indicator tools: heart rate and eye tracking? Can they be applied to game user research? Stay tuned!</p>

<p>With the advent of the big data era, the storage and processing of massive data has become a problem that plagues scholars in the computer field. Currently, typical representatives of frameworks or systems that are better at addressing such data mining and other massive data field problems on the market include Hadoop and Spark. And these two big data giants also use HDFS in the underlying storage engine.</p>
<p>HDFS, or Hadoop Distributed Filesystem, as the name suggests, is Hadoop’s distributed file system. Due to its superior performance and low deployment cost, it has also been favored by Spark.</p>
<p>What kind of magic does HDFS possess to provide high-speed throughput and storage performance for massive data?</p>
<p>What are its characteristics?</p>
<p>First of all, HDFS is a distributed file system. On an ordinary PC, the file system exists in the form of a single machine. However, no matter how efficient the CPU or how fast the storage device is, a single-machine system has certain performance problems due to the limitations of peripherals and the network. The theoretical performance of commonly used Gigabit Ethernet cards and m.2 high-speed SSDs on the market can only reach GB level, and 1PB of data even takes one million seconds to complete, which is completely unable to cope with the needs of PB or even EB big data environments. A single chopstick is easy to break, but a bundle of chopsticks is difficult to break. A single machine has a performance bottleneck, but multiple devices processing data in parallel can alleviate this problem. This is a distributed file system.</p>
<p>Due to the concurrent operation of multiple servers in the cluster, multiple devices simultaneously perform data IO to the external network, which allows the system to have better throughput and greatly improves the system’s performance. For HDFS, the structure diagram of the entire system is as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2F80a5068d-fa18-476c-9cc9-fb95ef058d61.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190917&#x2F;80a5068d-fa18-476c-9cc9-fb95ef058d61.jpg"></p>
<p>HDFS is mainly divided into three parts: client node, metadata node NameNode, and data node DataNode.</p>
<p>The client node serves as the access interface of HDFS. It obtains the metadata information of the requested data by sending a request to the NameNode (metadata is similar to a directory, guiding to find the location of the target, and recording basic information such as the target’s size and type). It then accesses the DataNode through the address corresponding to the metadata to obtain the target data.</p>
<p>For a large data cluster, data security is an extremely important issue.</p>
<p>For HDFS, due to the large number of machines in the cluster, the failure rate of the system is accompanied. When a machine in the system experiences a power outage or damage, the data on that node will be lost. If there are no corresponding data protection measures, serious losses will occur. HDFS focuses on data reliability and adopts two different processing methods for data and metadata.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Set up a Secondary NameNode for the metadata node NameNode to serve as a backup of the metadata node. The primary-standby mode is used to serve the system. If the NameNode fails, the Secondary NameNode will serve the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> In HDFS, data is stored in the form of multiple copies (usually three copies). These copies are stored in different cluster machines. When one or two of the servers fail, the target data can still be obtained through the third machine. At the same time, multiple copies can provide multiple concurrent operations when dealing with multiple clients accessing the same data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although such a multi-copy strategy and primary-secondary NameNode strategy can effectively solve system performance, it will bring certain data consistency overhead to the system, that is, use performance in exchange for data accuracy.</p>
<p>The so-called data consistency, in layman’s terms, means that accessing data in the system will always obtain the latest value. In other words, data in different copies or backups must always be updated synchronously.</p>
<p>So, for such a large multi-node HDFS cluster, how to ensure such consistency?</p>
<p>For the primary and secondary NameNode, when the client performs data operations on the system, the NameNode will record these operations, obtain the corresponding metadata operation log, and persist this log to the fsimage file.</p>
<p>Synchronously, the Secondary NameNode will continuously request the fsimage file of the NameNode to ensure that the metadata information on the primary and secondary servers remains consistent.</p>
<p>For data nodes, the concept of a primary copy and secondary copies is adopted. Data write operations will first interact with the primary copy. After writing to the primary copy node, the location of other copies will be obtained through the primary copy node, and the data writing will be completed level by level. When it is confirmed that all copies have been updated, the primary copy will return a write completion feedback. This ensures that the write completion operation is returned only after all three copies have been updated, ensuring the transactionality of a single write. The write process is shown in the figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190917%2Ff9503683-629f-4794-9068-8b3d7cdec4fd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190917&#x2F;f9503683-629f-4794-9068-8b3d7cdec4fd.jpg"></p>
<p>When a node in a multi-copy node fails, how will it be discovered?</p>
<p>The NameNode plays the role of a manager during the operation of the entire cluster, and it monitors the status information of all nodes in the cluster (a typical distributed file system, sheepdog, shows the relationship between this management node and the data node relatively well. In sheepdog, the data node is called sheep, and the management node is dog).</p>
<p>For the NameNode to monitor many nodes in the entire cluster at all times, continuous connection access will bring a great burden to the NameNode. Therefore, HDFS adopts a passive form of NameNode - the heartbeat mechanism.</p>
<p>The heartbeat mechanism means that the DataNode sends status information to the NameNode regularly, and the NameNode does not actively request status information from the DataNode. When a DataNode does not send heartbeat information to the NameNode for a long time, it will be considered that the DataNode has failed, and then corresponding data recovery and migration measures will be implemented.</p>
<p>HDFS improves system throughput through distribution; metadata nodes and data nodes complete data organization and management; multiple copies and primary and secondary NameNodes ensure data reliability; and the heartbeat mechanism completes cluster management. Each module has a clear division of labor, performs its own duties, and cooperates to ensure the high-performance performance of HDFS.</p>

    <title>[UE Sharing] I threw up the moment I got a Chicken Dinner — 3D Sickness in Games</title>
    <url>/2019/09/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20190926_28584_834923/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190926/28584_834923.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Chicken Dinner” originated from a game in 2017, <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>. With the popularity of the gameplay, similar battle royale games have been continuously launched, gaining a large number of players. “Calling friends to get a Chicken Dinner together” is happening in more and more people’s lives. However, there is a group of people who have never been able to experience the fun of getting a “Chicken Dinner”. Once they enter the game for a period of time, they will feel dizzy, nauseous, and experience significant physical discomfort.</p>
<p>This kind of dizziness that occurs when playing highly realistic 3D games is called 3D sickness or cybersickness. In addition to “Chicken Dinner”, many games can easily cause similar symptoms. The specific manifestations vary from player to player. Some people only experience it in FPS games with strong realism, while others also suffer from playing third-person 3D games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F0ed158f7-5e67-4276-b48d-b54c519eee3a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;0ed158f7-5e67-4276-b48d-b54c519eee3a.jpg"></p>
<p>Why do people get 3D sickness?</p>
<p>3D sickness has the same principle as motion sickness and seasickness. The fundamental reason is that the eyes and the body have different feelings about “whether the body is moving”.</p>
<p>The eyes judge whether they are moving by the scene they see, while the body has another set of vestibular systems that perceive movement. It is located in the inner ear and can continuously detect the actual spatial movement of the body, and is not affected by the visual system. For example, when a person’s body is turned in complete darkness, they can still feel which way they are turning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F5adb9bff-5eb6-4622-9cce-441e008cd5b0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;5adb9bff-5eb6-4622-9cce-441e008cd5b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the signals from the eyes and the signals from the body can reach the same conclusion, and work together to help our body make corresponding adjustments. For example, when we are running, the motion signal obtained by the vestibular system can help the visual system to adjust, so that we can maintain clear vision even when the surrounding environment is constantly moving.</p>
<p>However, when playing some 3D games with realistic graphics and high-speed scene switching, the signal received by the eyes is that you are moving at high speed, and the “movement” signal is transmitted to the brain; while the vestibular system does not detect that the body is moving, and transmits the “stillness” signal to the brain. The conflict between the two signals causes physical discomfort.</p>
<p>In the environment where people live, the consistency of various sensory channels is very important, as it helps us adapt to the ever-changing world. In ancient times, our ancestors heard dull footsteps and knew what kind of beast they would face, and seeing a red-hot piece of metal, they could also predict that touching it would burn their hands.</p>
<p>Therefore, 3D sickness is actually a self-protection mechanism produced by the human brain during evolution. When different sensory organs have opposite feelings, it may mean that one is in a bad situation, and the brain wants to remind the body: stop and get out of this situation.</p>
<p>What measures can be taken to alleviate 3D sickness?</p>
<p>Starting from the principle of 3D sickness, there are two ways to alleviate 3D sickness - make the eyes realize that they are not moving, or make the body think that it is also moving.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduce the image quality</strong> so that the picture is “not so real” to the brain.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F00030c7e-0b44-4934-b916-db1c29c03863.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;00030c7e-0b44-4934-b916-db1c29c03863.jpg"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Reduce the mouse speed</strong>, which is equivalent to reducing the moving speed of the scene.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Place some objects around the screen to provide static clues.</strong> Sit a little further away from the computer screen, and try to have as many of these static objects in your field of vision as possible to help your eyes perceive the signal of stillness.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>When performing intense actions, the body and head can gently sway in the direction of the action</strong>, instead of just moving the eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fb5a5f0e5-f485-400e-baca-3090e5af1614.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;b5a5f0e5-f485-400e-baca-3090e5af1614.gif"></p>
<p>Game Testing and 3D Sickness</p>
<p>In laboratory testing, we hope to avoid 3D sickness in recruited players as much as possible. This not only prevents players from experiencing the game and obtaining test results, but more importantly, it brings uncomfortable experiences to players. Therefore, before game testing, it is necessary to make appropriate settings for games and players to avoid 3D sickness.</p>
<p>Assessing the possibility of the test game causing 3D sickness</p>
<p>The games that are most likely to cause 3D sickness are usually first-person 3D games, but some third-person games can also cause 3D sickness if the scenes are realistic. Generally speaking, the following factors are closely related to the occurrence of 3D sickness:</p>
<ul>
<li>High image fidelity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fb136cfce-d9ae-4da6-b008-7f775c10da8f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;b136cfce-d9ae-4da6-b008-7f775c10da8f.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive picture shake</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F63fb1771-2275-4ba3-8a07-f01bc78b124c.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;63fb1771-2275-4ba3-8a07-f01bc78b124c.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>High-speed movement of scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff6deaec5-dc5c-4611-84db-a2eb7c07558c.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f6deaec5-dc5c-4611-84db-a2eb7c07558c.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>Perspective close to real height</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F60986d2a-21c3-4ec8-8dda-0373e0aa9d90.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;60986d2a-21c3-4ec8-8dda-0373e0aa9d90.jpg"></p>
<p>Make corresponding screenings when recruiting players</p>
<p>Whether 3D sickness occurs is not only related to the game, but also to the condition of the human body. Generally, people who have motion sickness and seasickness are also more likely to develop 3D sickness. When the test game has the risk of 3D sickness, you can inform the players of the risk in advance and ask about their past experiences.</p>

    <title>Introduction to Elasticsearch</title>

<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and data analysis engine with features like fast response, horizontal scaling, high availability, and high accuracy.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is a full-text search engine toolkit based on Lucene. Because using Lucene requires a high learning curve, Elasticsearch provides a simple and easy-to-use interface on top of it.  When building a website, if you want search functionality, you only need to use the Elasticsearch tool.  Then you can implement a search function.</p>
<h2 id="Inverted-Index-in-Elasticsearch"><a href="#Inverted-Index-in-Elasticsearch" class="headerlink" title="Inverted Index in Elasticsearch"></a>Inverted Index in Elasticsearch</h2><p>The inverted index is an important concept in Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch processes documents through the inverted index.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a bunch of documents, each containing several words. Each word is assigned a certain weight according to the number of times it appears in the corresponding document. Therefore, we store these weighted words in an orderly manner, thus forming an inverted index.</p>
<p>Each word entry in the inverted index is associated with the documents that contain the word.  Therefore, the inverted index comes from the practical need to find related records based on the value of an attribute.</p>
<p>In the index table, the key represents the corresponding attribute value, and the value represents the address of the record with that attribute value. This is different from the usual method of confirming attribute values by records, so we call it an inverted index.</p>
<p>Figure 1.1 shows an example of an inverted index. Suppose there are three articles. The title of article 1 is “Using Spark to Read Data in Hive”. The title of article 2 is “Hive Data Mining Practice”, and the content of article 3 is “Introduction to Spark”. After being processed by the tokenizer in Elasticsearch, the keywords of article 1 will become spark and hive. The keywords of article 2 are hive and data mining practice. The keyword of article 3 is spark. By querying keywords, we can find the articles to which the keywords belong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fd4dd0b95-d5bc-4146-9081-805efc9a51bf.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;d4dd0b95-d5bc-4146-9081-805efc9a51bf.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Figure 1.1 Inverted Index Table)</em></p>

<p>Of course, the implementation in Elasticsearch is not so simple.  Issues such as weight, tokenization, and the amount of inverted index data must also be considered to achieve a good query effect.</p>
<h2 id="Elasticsearch-Concepts"><a href="#Elasticsearch-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Elasticsearch Concepts"></a>Elasticsearch Concepts</h2><h3 id="Basic-Concepts-of-Distributed-Systems"><a href="#Basic-Concepts-of-Distributed-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Basic Concepts of Distributed Systems"></a>Basic Concepts of Distributed Systems</h3><p>Because Elasticsearch is stored in a distributed manner, some knowledge of distributed systems is required. Here are some basic knowledge of distributed systems.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cluster:</strong> Organized by one or more server nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Server Node:</strong> A server node is a server in the cluster, and each server node is identified by a different name.</li>
<li><strong>Shard:</strong> Divide the index into multiple blocks and place them on different machines, which can improve the throughput of the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Replica:</strong> Copy shards and store them on different machines to improve the disaster tolerance of the cluster.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Elasticsearch-Index-Related-Concepts"><a href="#Elasticsearch-Index-Related-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Elasticsearch Index Related Concepts"></a>Elasticsearch Index Related Concepts</h3><p>Elasticsearch needs to build corresponding indexes for querying, so it also needs to store data. Based on this, it is constructed hierarchically like commonly used relational databases. Below is a description of the difference between relational databases and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F22cfcdd1-b30a-4140-b923-c68e5540f5cc.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;22cfcdd1-b30a-4140-b923-c68e5540f5cc.jpg"></p>

<p>The <code>index</code> in Elasticsearch corresponds to the <code>database</code> in MySQL. An <code>index</code>, similar to a <code>database</code>, contains multiple <code>types</code>. <code>Type</code> corresponds to the <code>table</code> in MySQL. A row of data in a MySQL database corresponds to a piece of JSON data in Elasticsearch. Similarly, <code>fields</code> in Elasticsearch represent columns in MySQL.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190926/28584_834949.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the advancement of technology, gaming has developed rapidly worldwide. From the earliest 2D pixelated graphics to today’s cinematic quality, games have undergone countless innovations and iterations.  When considering which innovations have been truly groundbreaking for gaming, “face customization systems” definitely qualify.</p>
<p>Currently, there’s a trend in the gaming world where players have a large degree of customization over their characters, and customization features are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Players are encouraged to create their own in-game appearances, leading to the phenomenon of “five minutes of gameplay, two hours of face customization.” To prevent user churn right after entering the game, the face customization system is gradually becoming an important experiential feature of games, and its overall user experience design is becoming increasingly important. Below, we will examine the design of an excellent face customization system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F29c46df5-1866-453d-ad95-c37e99d417fa.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;29c46df5-1866-453d-ad95-c37e99d417fa.jpg"></p>
<p>Most current games have relatively complex face customization features. It’s important to maintain the user’s psychological comfort despite interacting with these complex controls for an extended period.  One approach is to add dynamic particles to the background interface of the face customization screen. This reduces the anxiety associated with the complexity and numerous operations involved, and also alleviates the stiffness of the character model’s expression when it’s not changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F1b355632-c929-4bb9-96de-d801422d1b80.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;1b355632-c929-4bb9-96de-d801422d1b80.jpg"></p>
<p>The face customization interface needs to highlight the core character model, while other UI layers should be relatively subdued. Visually, the UI frames on both sides of the interface can use an achromatic (grayscale) design. This reduces the visual weight of the dense UI frames on both sides, enhancing the expressiveness of the central character model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff1a25fa8-b295-4d71-9271-c358147b8e9f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f1a25fa8-b295-4d71-9271-c358147b8e9f.jpg"></p>
<p>Typically, the UI interaction hierarchy on the left side is the most complex. Making it clear and easy to understand in this context is very difficult. As can be seen in the image, the left side of the interface uses three different selection styles for the first, second, and third levels: internal fill, outer circular outline, and outer rectangular outline. The differentiation of these three selection styles allows for clear hierarchical distinction even in extreme cases where the UI background is visually weak and the three-layer UI structure is very compact, which is very rare in other games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Fa6e392a0-b966-4236-9c88-78d6536e08b8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;a6e392a0-b966-4236-9c88-78d6536e08b8.jpg"></p>
<p>When the user needs to focus on detailed changes, the UI layers on both sides can interfere with visual focus and may feel cumbersome during specific operations. Therefore, as shown in the image, operations like selecting colors for specific detailed areas can hide other UI elements and enlarge the character model. This reduces the visual pressure from other UI frames, allows for better focus on the changes resulting from the operation, and also enhances the sense of immersion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff0c811d7-2334-487c-a64f-17a719cf8e68.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f0c811d7-2334-487c-a64f-17a719cf8e68.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course, when there are features in the interface that need to be emphasized, they need to be differentiated from other UI controls to highlight their importance. As shown in the image, the “Face Customization Space” entry button uses a purple gradient on top of the main dark blue color, making it visually prominent. The visual richness of the entry button conveys the richness of the content accessible after entering, which is a clever design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F94855a2d-5676-4bc7-8710-2fec7e9e4316.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;94855a2d-5676-4bc7-8710-2fec7e9e4316.jpg"></p>
<p>Localized operation prompts corresponding to specific areas during face customization are common. However, in some games, these prompts appear as white patches stuck on the face, looking crude and simplistic. Furthermore, it’s difficult to perceive a sense of layering with white patches visually. Therefore, the corresponding prompt area for face customization can have a textured effect, making it look more three-dimensional. This style is more aligned with the perception of facial scanning and creates a special feeling of AI facial recognition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2Ff22c274b-3adb-4f41-b9ac-39feb37743b5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;f22c274b-3adb-4f41-b9ac-39feb37743b5.jpg"></p>
<p>The complex and lengthy nature of face customization can easily lead to user fatigue. Therefore, the design needs to evoke certain emotional fluctuations in the user. As shown in the image, the style selection for lip color is designed in the form of a lipstick palette, which is more in line with the daily usage scenarios of female players. The colors also include makeup effects that are fashionable and trendy, exceeding the player’s psychological expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the face customization experience can enhance the user’s enthusiasm in the game, just like the act of face customization itself is a part of enjoying the game.</p>

    <title>When a Computer Sees &quot;2333&quot;, What Does It Think It Means?</title>
    <url>/2019/09/23/netease-ux-articles/news_20190926_28584_834951/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190926/28584_834951.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine a scenario, if you get 100 sentences spoken by players, how would you analyze the players’ emotional attitudes?</p>
<h3 id="How-do-we-do-it"><a href="#How-do-we-do-it" class="headerlink" title="How do we do it?"></a>How do we do it?</h3><p>You might do this: read through these 100 sentences and judge whether each sentence has a positive, negative, or neutral attitude.</p>
<p>You might also do this: classify the 100 sentences spoken by the players and find that some sentences are praising the costumes, some are discussing playing dungeons, and some are enthusiastically discussing gossip (“818”, a Chinese internet slang that usually refers to gossip, scandals, or controversies within a community, especially online).</p>
<p>Then, you get 500 player utterances, how are you going to analyze them? Maybe just grit your teeth and do it.</p>
<p>So, if you get 50,000 player utterances, what are you going to do? You might ask for help from friends, or randomly select a small number of utterances for analysis…</p>
<p>Of course, we can also ask a computer to do this for us.</p>
<h3 id="How-does-a-computer-do-it"><a href="#How-does-a-computer-do-it" class="headerlink" title="How does a computer do it?"></a>How does a computer do it?</h3><p>If a computer analyzes these 50,000 utterances, the first troublesome thing for it is that it doesn’t really read Chinese sentences. Unlike English sentences, where spaces separate words, it needs to first convert sentences into words. This process of converting sentences into words is called word segmentation.</p>
<p>Word segmentation is the basis for sentiment analysis. According to a certain strategy, the sentences to be analyzed are matched with the entries in the machine dictionary. If a word is found, then this word will be recognized.</p>
<p>After word segmentation, the computer gets more words than the 50,000 sentences. At this time, it still doesn’t understand what these words mean. Then, it starts the second dictionary lookup process. This time, the dictionary it needs to check is what the attitude of each word is. For example, “excellent” is a positive word, and “bad” is a negative word. When it has a dictionary to compare with, it knows the sentiment polarity (positive&#x2F;negative&#x2F;neutral) of each word.</p>
<p>Although our computer is relatively stupid and needs to be taught everything and check everything, it has a good memory and can remember as many words as there are. It can also map these words to the sentences before word segmentation, and finally tell us the sentiment polarity of each sentence.</p>
<p>Here, we also need to specifically point out how the computer handles those negative words. For example, “not good”, the computer will multiply a score of -1 by the polarity of “good”. This is where the problem comes in, how is “have to say good” handled? The computer will use (-1)^2 to handle it, which is “double negation means affirmation”, triple is (-1)^3, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sentiment-analysis"><a href="#Advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sentiment-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Advantages and disadvantages of sentiment analysis"></a>Advantages and disadvantages of sentiment analysis</h3><p>The advantages of using a computer are very obvious: speed, ability to handle large amounts of data, and uniform standards. Speed and the ability to handle large amounts of data literally mean that it can help us quickly process even very large text sentences. Uniform standards mean that although our manual processing is smarter than the computer and will read sentences directly, “a thousand readers have a thousand Hamlets”, different people have different understandings, which also causes deviations in the analysis, while the “foolish” computer will not have such deviations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F9e262171-d6a8-4afe-9b16-1dddc72df525.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;9e262171-d6a8-4afe-9b16-1dddc72df525.jpg"></p>
<p>However, the weakness of this simple computer sentiment analysis is also obvious, which is “too stupid”. Chinese language is extensive and profound. The computer currently needs to handle negative words separately, not to mention emphasis, rhetorical questions, and negation of negation. Imagine if you ask the computer what “ba ba ba ba ba zhu le” (一把把把把住了) means, what will it understand it as.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Translator’s Note: This sentence means “One <em>ba</em> held the <em>ba</em> firmly”. Each <em>ba</em> 把 has its own meaning.<br>一 &#x3D; one, 把 &#x3D; measure word for things you can hold with a handle, 把 &#x3D; Handle (like a door handle), 把 &#x3D; to hold, 住 &#x3D; firmly, 了 &#x3D; (Verb Suffix showing completed action).)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="How-to-improve-the-accuracy-of-sentiment-analysis"><a href="#How-to-improve-the-accuracy-of-sentiment-analysis" class="headerlink" title="How to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis?"></a>How to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis?</h3><p>Although our computer’s text processing accuracy is not high, it is fast and can handle large amounts of data. Of course, we can currently use some methods to make the results more accurate. One method is to expand the dictionary. For example, the widely used sentiment dictionary is HowNet’s “Chinese Sentiment Analysis Word Collection” (Dong Zhendong and Dong Qiang, 2007; Du Zhenlei, 2013), which summarizes words that express positive and negative tendencies and degree words.</p>
<p>But when we use this dictionary to analyze texts containing more online terms, such as bullet comments, it is not enough. At this time, we can add other dictionaries, such as the multi-dimensional sentiment dictionary used by Xiao Zhuo et al. (2015), which includes 7 types of emotions. In this dictionary, “2333”, a neutral word in the original dictionary, is classified as “happy” (乐) emotion. Words like “male god” (男神), “against the sky” (逆天), and “awesome” (牛逼) are classified into the “good” (好) dimension.</p>
<p>In addition to enriching the dictionary, we can also use different dictionaries to produce results and then cross-compare to enhance accuracy. Finally, at a higher level, machine learning such as clustering can be used to analyze text, and convolutional neural networks and fuzzy algorithms can be used to analyze images. Sentiment analysis is far more than just word segmentation and then looking up the dictionary. The NLP technologies related to sentiment analysis include text information encoding word2vector, sense2vector, elmo, etc. This article only introduces a basic and simple sentiment analysis method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190926%2F5c69c544-f1ec-4aad-bd86-860ca73ac72d.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190926&#x2F;5c69c544-f1ec-4aad-bd86-860ca73ac72d.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Mop No. 233 Expression</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>(Translator’s Note: This is a very common internet slang phrase originating from the 233rd emoji on the Mop forums, a popular Chinese online community. The emoji depicts a character laughing hysterically while pounding the ground. Therefore, “2333” is often used to express laughter, similar to “lol” or “haha” in English. The number of ‘3’s can vary to indicate the intensity of the laughter.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, there are many kinds of algorithms, and they are constantly improving. Our user research is also constantly advancing with the times. There will be more research displays in the future, so stay tuned.</p>

    <title>[US Sharing] Sublime Text × Big Data Development = Efficiency UP</title>
    <url>/2019/09/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20190927_28584_835046/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190927/28584_835046.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="Introduction-to-Sublime"><a href="#Introduction-to-Sublime" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Sublime"></a>Introduction to Sublime</h2><p>Sublime Text is a code editor with a beautiful user interface and powerful features, such as code thumbnails, Python plugins, code snippets, etc. Key bindings, menus, and toolbars are also customizable. Sublime Text’s main features include spell check, bookmarks, a complete Python API, Goto functionality, instant project switching, multiple selections, multiple windows, and more. Sublime Text is a cross-platform editor that supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and other operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="Case-Demonstration"><a href="#Case-Demonstration" class="headerlink" title="Case Demonstration"></a>Case Demonstration</h2><p>Sublime was once the mainstream front-end editor (although it has gradually been replaced by VSCode now), and its powerful text functions are also commendable for the efficiency of big data development. Next, an example will be introduced to help everyone appreciate the brilliance of Sublime:</p>
<p>Sublime supports the syntax of most mainstream programming languages. When we open a piece of text, we only need to set it to the corresponding syntax format in the View –&gt; Syntax of the main menu to highlight the keywords:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190927%2F132c0688-7ffe-43c9-b040-c5b1d67057d3.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190927&#x2F;132c0688-7ffe-43c9-b040-c5b1d67057d3.gif"></p>
<p>One of the highlights of Sublime Text is that it supports multiple selections - selecting multiple areas at the same time, and then editing them at the same time.</p>
<p>Ctrl + D selects the word where the cursor is currently located and highlights all occurrences of the word. Ctrl + D again selects the next occurrence of the word. During the multiple word selection process, use Ctrl + K to skip, Ctrl + U to go back, and Esc to exit multiple editing.</p>
<p>A major application scenario of multiple word selection is renaming - to make the code cleaner. Although Sublime Text cannot automatically rename like an IDE (such as Eclipse), we can use multiple selection + multiple editing for intuitive and convenient renaming:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190927%2F16522b6b-92a9-489e-b51e-a2943dc9121f.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190927&#x2F;16522b6b-92a9-489e-b51e-a2943dc9121f.gif"></p>
<p>In programming languages that use semicolons as statement terminators, the mixed use of special characters seems to have little effect on the compilation and operation of the code, but in languages like Python that use indentation as syntax, mixing tabs and spaces will cause errors when the code is executed. Sublime’s lower right corner can set Tab Size: how many spaces a Tab key is converted into, and then select Convert Indentation To Spaces to convert all Tab keys to space keys.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, when the code is selected, a long horizontal line represents a tab, and a small dot represents a space:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190927%2F3196138d-4407-44c6-9b2a-9f88299a34f7.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190927&#x2F;3196138d-4407-44c6-9b2a-9f88299a34f7.gif"></p>
<h2 id="Finding-Replacing"><a href="#Finding-Replacing" class="headerlink" title="Finding &amp; Replacing"></a>Finding &amp; Replacing</h2><p>Sublime Text provides powerful find (and replace) functions. The basis of replace is find, so the replace function is introduced here. Use Ctrl + H (Command + option + F on Mac) to bring up the standard find &amp; replace module. The first button on the left of the first row is the regular expression switch, which means whether the searched content is a regular expression or an ordinary string. The following demonstrates calling up the standard find &amp; replace module, then turning off the regular expression switch, and replacing the string UBB with ux_b:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190927%2Fb8b2007d-a999-4d12-bc8c-2857816971f4.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190927&#x2F;b8b2007d-a999-4d12-bc8c-2857816971f4.gif"></p>
<p>After the code is modified, Ctrl + J can merge the currently selected area into one line (in actual development, it is recommended to have one variable per line, aligned with the letter at the beginning):</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190927%2F8f46a51f-99ea-4864-b70c-2fa99a450260.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190927&#x2F;8f46a51f-99ea-4864-b70c-2fa99a450260.gif"></p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>In addition to the built-in functions of the editor, Sublime can also be used as a simple compiler (the compiler call path needs to be configured by yourself). You can install the package control console (Package Control), use Ctrl+Shift+P (Command+Shift+P on Mac) to call it up, and then you can install and use various extension plugins on Sublime.</p>

    <title>Is the Goal of Game Interaction Design Always &quot;Convenience&quot;?</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20190929/28584_835196.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>When we talk about interaction design, it naturally connects to user experience. Interaction is designed to improve user experience. Designers gradually summarize their own methodologies in their work to make the user’s gaming experience smoother and give the game product the attribute of “convenience”. No matter what kind of game, most of the time, this is the purpose of interaction design.</p>
<p>Convenience can be divided into visual, auditory, tactile (operational), etc.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Visual convenience can be further divided into UI layout, UI size, etc.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the player’s visual center will be concentrated in the middle area of the screen. We can divide the screen into a nine-square grid. The player’s visual center will be concentrated in the middle area and its surroundings. When laying out the UI, most games will also concentrate important information in this area, allowing players to obtain the important information that the interface wants to present to players more quickly and conveniently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2F08c0e33f-6db2-4e3d-8bba-51bddc1017cb.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;08c0e33f-6db2-4e3d-8bba-51bddc1017cb.jpg"></p>
<p>You can observe the games on mobile phones. Although many interfaces are not directly centered, they may have a left-right&#x2F;up-down layout style. However, if you draw a frame around the important information as a whole, you can see that the overall is still concentrated towards the middle. If the important information of a game is scattered around, with pieces here and there, the player’s reading efficiency will be much lower, and such a design is relatively unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2F9b675059-694a-4c04-97e0-1907a876c415.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;9b675059-694a-4c04-97e0-1907a876c415.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(The character interface of <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword</em> is distributed left and right, but the characters and information are still centered overall)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>UI size refers to the proportion of fonts, icons, and various pop-up windows and other UIs in the interface. Designing UIs of reasonable size is one of the basic qualities that game interaction design should have. UI size can help players distinguish important information from secondary information. A comfortable UI ratio is also the foundation for players to play games for a long time. If a game’s UI cannot even be seen clearly, let alone the gameplay.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of mobile games, the most common problem when many PC games are converted to mobile games is the UI size allocation. PC games display a lot of content. Directly reducing the proportion to the mobile game interface will make it appear very crowded and small. Game designers mostly design on large screens. Looking directly at the large screen, it is easy to feel that the current proportion is already very suitable or even too large. This is very dangerous.</p>
<p>The best way is to often put the interface on the mobile phone to see the effect when making the interface. If time is tight, you can also take screenshots of mature mobile game interfaces, extract the font, icon and other sizes from its interface as a standard, and do it on this basis, which can get twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Convenience</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to vision, the area where players are convenient to operate when holding the device comfortably is often around the screen. Fortunately, these two areas do not focus on one piece, which is convenient for us to better design mobile games. For games with heavy operations, in core combat, we often design the joystick and skills on the left and right sides. Initially, it was designed for the purpose of operational convenience, but now this design has gradually become a barrier.</p>
<p>The design barrier means that new designers do not need to think too much to come up with the design of the left joystick and right attack. If there is a new game whose interaction is left attack and right joystick, it will be much more difficult for players to get started. When a function develops to the point where it is unnecessary and unsuitable to design a brand new operation, a design barrier is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Fe69a8661-1e5b-40f1-80d3-5aa6d4c35775.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;e69a8661-1e5b-40f1-80d3-5aa6d4c35775.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition to the operational convenience design of a single interface, the transition between interfaces also needs to consider the convenience of operation. Generally speaking, letting players achieve the goal with the fewest steps is what designers want to see. In traditional games, the entrances of various functions will be arranged in the main interface. Enter the secondary function interface through the main interface, and then filter the secondary functions. If you want to call up other functions, you need to return to the main interface from the secondary interface, and then select another function.</p>
<p>This is a simple page turning idea. But some games have done better, such as the rhythm game <em>Muse Dash</em>. Except for the core combat, you can directly click to enter various functional entrances no matter what interface you are in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Fb528ed31-d607-4e98-87ac-3e238f9b9037.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;b528ed31-d607-4e98-87ac-3e238f9b9037.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20190929%2Ff4a9b68f-57e9-4e71-ba98-f31740d198a8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20190929&#x2F;f4a9b68f-57e9-4e71-ba98-f31740d198a8.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(In <em>MUSE DASH</em>, the display of tabs in different interfaces can directly point to the function to be entered regardless of the interface)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>However, this design is not universal, and it is more suitable for use in games with fewer total functions, otherwise it may also lead to confusion in player memory and other adverse consequences.</p>
<p>However, is the purpose of game interaction design always “convenience”? The answer is no. The word “convenience” comes from “Xunzi·Jundao”: “Its response to changes is also quick and convenient without confusion.” It means to be convenient and straightforward, convenient and light. In some game designs, it is not enough to just consider convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Design</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the game’s novice guidance design is not “convenience” from the beginning. Normally, after downloading a game, clicking to open it and you can experience the game content, is the fastest and most “convenient” process. However, the novice guide breaks this process. Most games’ novice guides do not allow skipping. Players must experience the novice before they can enter the game.</p>
<p>Now many players have more or less game experience. For them, downloading the same type of game and going through the cumbersome novice guide is likely to cause disgust. However, in the era when the game market was not so prosperous, the novice guidance of many games was missing or even non-existent. For example, a new 3D game, even if new players know that WASD can control the movement of up, down, left, and right, they don’t know what they should do, where they should go, where to pick up tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>Novice guidance is necessary for players, but its form of expression and detail can be distinguished. For example, <em>Onmyoji</em> and <em>Onmyoji Arena</em> can choose whether they are novices or veterans before starting, and choose the corresponding guidance design according to their own needs.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Interaction Design</strong></p>
<p>Emotional design, which we often talk about, uses interactive operations to influence the player’s flow and enable the player to have a better gaming experience. The purpose of this type of design is also not “convenience”.</p>
<p>For example, the card draw system common in card games. The most convenient interaction is undoubtedly to click the button to enter the card draw, enter the card draw interface, and click to draw the card. However, more and more card games have set up card draw interactions, typically <em>Onmyoji</em>‘s drawing symbols to draw cards, <em>Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen</em>‘s male protagonist interactive card draw, and so on. These operations that can be given emotional design often have some characteristics: the realization of the function itself is simple, it requires a certain price or the benefits are large, and it is easy to trigger players’ emotional resonance through interactions other than hard-core operations.</p>
<p>The purpose of game interaction design is not necessarily “convenience”. In different situations and for different purposes, the purpose of interaction design will change. Since most of the time interaction is designed around convenience, beginners may fall into the misunderstanding of “convenience” supremacy when summarizing methodologies, and miss some interesting designs. More seriously, sometimes the operation design that is considered convenient may make it difficult for players to understand. Therefore, no matter when, we must return to the perspective of user experience. First, think clearly about the purpose of the function you are responsible for, what it can bring to users, what users will expect… You cannot be preconceived and put on your own methodology. The purpose of interaction design is not absolute at any time.</p>

    <title>You&#39;ve Learned So Many Techniques, But the Requester Says They Don&#39;t Need User Research</title>

<p>User research, as a new role, still faces many doubts and objections during its promotion. Because for a long time in the past, there was no such role as user research, and products were still made successfully. Today, I will introduce to you what doubts user research may face and how to deal with these doubts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-We-Have-Never-Had-a-User-Research-Role-So-We-Don’t-Need-User-Research"><a href="#1-We-Have-Never-Had-a-User-Research-Role-So-We-Don’t-Need-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="1. We Have Never Had a User Research Role, So We Don’t Need User Research."></a>1. We Have Never Had a User Research Role, So We Don’t Need User Research.</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> Many old-fashioned people will have this feeling. We have never had this role, and isn’t our product also very good?</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Not having this role does not mean that user research has not been done. Every product must have researched its target users, understood the preferences of target users, and peeked at the evaluations left by users on the Internet. And these are all doing user research work. There were no professionals to do it before, now is the time to let professionals do it!</p>
<h2 id="2-We-Are-Very-Busy-the-Schedule-is-Very-Full-and-There-is-No-Time-for-User-Research"><a href="#2-We-Are-Very-Busy-the-Schedule-is-Very-Full-and-There-is-No-Time-for-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. We Are Very Busy, the Schedule is Very Full, and There is No Time for User Research"></a>2. We Are Very Busy, the Schedule is Very Full, and There is No Time for User Research</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> The product schedule is very full, and the understanding of user research is not enough, which may cause the above-mentioned troubles for the requester. We are already very busy and have no time to do user research.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Doing user research with a small amount of time now may save a lot of time in the future. According to previous research, in the software development process alone, 60% of errors are due to incorrect user experience. User researchers can design relevant research according to the project schedule and give agile feedback in the shortest possible time. Sacrifice a small amount of time cost in exchange for future efficiency and direction, why not?</p>
<h2 id="3-We-Don’t-Have-Anything-to-Research-Now"><a href="#3-We-Don’t-Have-Anything-to-Research-Now" class="headerlink" title="3. We Don’t Have Anything to Research Now"></a>3. We Don’t Have Anything to Research Now</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> When the project is in the initial stage, there may not be a stable build, maybe just an idea, so the requester may think that we have nothing to study now.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> At any stage, there is something to study. Even if it’s just some core ideas, user researchers can do some research to help the requester understand user needs. For example, concept research can be carried out even without a demo.</p>
<h2 id="4-User-Research-Takes-a-Long-Time-and-the-Information-is-Lagging"><a href="#4-User-Research-Takes-a-Long-Time-and-the-Information-is-Lagging" class="headerlink" title="4. User Research Takes a Long Time, and the Information is Lagging"></a>4. User Research Takes a Long Time, and the Information is Lagging</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> When the version is iterating rapidly, some requesters may feel that by the time you finish the report, we have already iterated several times.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Agile feedback and advance booking can avoid delays. When the product has some ideas, it should communicate with the user researcher in time and make an appointment for related research in advance so that the research can be carried out smoothly and save time. Agile feedback means that after the research is completed on the same day, the key information is quickly fed back to the requester, and it is not necessary to wait for all the research to be completed before feedback. In addition, research information is not only useful for the current version, but also valuable for the next version.</p>
<h2 id="5-We-Don’t-Have-the-Money-to-Do-User-Research"><a href="#5-We-Don’t-Have-the-Money-to-Do-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="5. We Don’t Have the Money to Do User Research"></a>5. We Don’t Have the Money to Do User Research</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> In the case of a limited budget, the requester may feel that my money is spent on the blade, and there is no more budget for user research.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We cannot afford <em>not</em> to do this kind of research. For example, in the development stage, you can understand many usability problems by spending only a very small cost. In the later stage, the maintenance cost of these problems is usually more expensive. At the same time, user experience research is also an investment in future revenue. A good user experience can bring more profits.</p>
<p>Today, I shared with you the doubts and confusions that the requester may have in the early stage. In the future, I will continue to share with you the doubts that the requester may have in the process of doing user research. For example, is the user research method scientific? Are the conclusions reliable?</p>

<p>The problem of ranking has always been a classic and core issue in the computer field.  From simple numerical data sorting like bubble sort and quick sort, to more complex, real-world business problems, such as the ranking of results retrieved from keywords in an app’s search bar, display advertising, and the ordering of items in recommendation lists, the problem is quite involved.  The quality of the ranking results greatly impacts the user experience, as well as advertising revenue for search, recommendation, and advertising businesses.  Unlike traditional ranking methods, Learning to Rank (LTR) can be simply understood as using machine learning methods to sort and display instances.</p>
<h2 id="Evaluation-Metrics-for-Learning-to-Rank"><a href="#Evaluation-Metrics-for-Learning-to-Rank" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation Metrics for Learning to Rank:"></a>Evaluation Metrics for Learning to Rank:</h2><table>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Precision and Recall (PR):</strong> Precision reflects the accuracy rate, and recall reflects the completeness rate.</p>
<p><strong>Mean Average Precision (MAP):</strong>  AP (Average Precision) can be understood as order-sensitive recall. MAP then averages this. The higher the position of the relevant documents retrieved by the system, the higher the MAP value.  It is calculated for a single query as the mean of the average precision scores for each relevant document retrieved.</p>
<p>AP &#x3D; Summation from(k&#x3D;1,n)[P(k) * rel(k)] &#x2F; Number of Relevant Documents</p>
<ul>
<li>Where <code>k</code> is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents.</li>
<li><code>n</code> is the number of retrieved documents.</li>
<li><code>P(k)</code> is the precision at cut-off <code>k</code> in the list.</li>
<li><code>rel(k)</code> is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank <code>k</code> is a relevant document, zero otherwise.<br>MAP is the mean of the AP scores across multiple queries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG):</strong> Cumulatively calculates the overall gain value.  In MAP, the four documents are either relevant or irrelevant to the query, that is, the relevance is either 0 or 1.  nDCG improves this by dividing the relevance into r+1 levels from 0 to r. The formula in the figure above is the DCG calculation formula, but the comparability of DCG between lists of different lengths is not high. nDCG adds normalization processing.</p>
<p>DCG_p &#x3D; rel_1 + summation from(i&#x3D;2,p) [ rel_i &#x2F; log2(i) ]</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p</code> is a particular rank position.</li>
<li><code>rel_i</code> is the graded relevance of the result at position <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>nDCG_p &#x3D; DCG_p &#x2F; IDCG</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IDCG</code> is the <em>ideal DCG</em>, the DCG value for a perfect ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR):</strong> Takes the reciprocal of the ranking of the correct answer in the results given by the evaluated system as its accuracy, and then averages it for all questions.</p>
<h2 id="Model-Classification-for-Learning-to-Rank"><a href="#Model-Classification-for-Learning-to-Rank" class="headerlink" title="Model Classification for Learning to Rank:"></a>Model Classification for Learning to Rank:</h2><p>Learning to rank models are usually divided into pointwise methods, pairwise methods, and listwise methods. The three different design ideas are mainly reflected in the annotation methods and loss functions.</p>
<p><strong>Pointwise Methods:</strong></p>
<p>This is the simplest and easiest to understand solution. It transforms the ranking problem into a common classification or regression problem in machine learning. If the final prediction target is a real value, it is a regression problem. If it is a probability problem, it is a classification problem, such as CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction. First, each processing object is manually labeled with training samples. Machine learning models such as support vector machines and logistic regression are used to adjust parameters. Finally, new instances use the model’s scoring function to get a new ranking score. This type of method has an obvious disadvantage: it does not consider the relative relationship between instances.</p>
<p><strong>Pairwise Methods:</strong></p>
<p>This approach gives the relative ranking between each instance. According to the relative ranking, the final ranking of all instances can also be given. This is mainly because it is easy to calculate the gradient of the loss function, but it is difficult to directly calculate the value of the loss function. Representative methods are the Lambda series, such as LambdaRank and LambdaMART, RankNet.</p>
<p><strong>Listwise Methods:</strong></p>
<p>This approach directly gives the overall ranking of all instances, directly optimizing evaluation indicators such as nDCG and ERR. However, it is more complicated during training because all training instances need to be labeled with their rankings.</p>
<h2 id="Major-Challenges-in-Ranking"><a href="#Major-Challenges-in-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Major Challenges in Ranking:"></a>Major Challenges in Ranking:</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Serious imbalance in the ratio of positive and negative samples:</strong> How to sample reasonably. For example, in CTR, there are many impressions, but very few click behaviors. In recommendations, there are many browsing behaviors, but very few purchase behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Sparse target data:</strong> Accuracy is not high enough.</li>
<li><strong>High real-time requirements:</strong> For example, being able to change the recommendation list in real time based on the latest click behavior.</li>
<li><strong>The importance of multiple different objectives cannot be quantified:</strong> Advertising may aim to increase the CTR click-through rate, but in games, it is sometimes retention, purchase rate, repurchase rate, etc. How to measure the importance of recommended list instances for different objectives is also very complex.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Common-LTR-Ranking-Models-in-Industry"><a href="#Common-LTR-Ranking-Models-in-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Common LTR Ranking Models in Industry:"></a>Common LTR Ranking Models in Industry:</h2><p><strong>The evolution of algorithms in the industry:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Artificial Rules -&gt; Linear Models -&gt; Tree Models (GBDT) -&gt; Deep Learning
</code></pre>
<p>Here are several ranking models widely used in the industry:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>LR + GBDT (Semi-automated Feature Combination):</strong> This combined model has been widely used in CTR prediction, and of course, the ranking part of many companies’ recommendation systems also deploys this combined model. The LR model has good interpretability, but it requires good feature engineering and cannot effectively extract combined features. Therefore, the GBDT model can be used first to extract combined features and enhance the generalization performance of the model, and the new feature vector is input into LR.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>FM Model (Automated Second-Order Feature Combination):</strong> That is, the Factorization Machine model. On the basis of linear features, second-order feature combinations are directly introduced, and the inner product of corresponding feature vectors is used to represent them. In essence, these features are embedded.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wide &amp; Deep Model (Automated Higher-Order Feature Combination):</strong> First used by Google in Google Play for app recommendation ranking. The wide part is a linear model, and the deep part embeds the combined high-dimensional sparse features into low-dimensional dense feature vectors using a neural network. Joint training of the two parts can complement each other’s shortcomings in complex feature engineering and insufficient interpretability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Application-Scenarios-of-Learning-to-Rank-in-Recommendations"><a href="#Application-Scenarios-of-Learning-to-Rank-in-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Application Scenarios of Learning to Rank in Recommendations:"></a>Application Scenarios of Learning to Rank in Recommendations:</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Multi-channel Recall Fusion Ranking:</strong></p>
<p>A recommendation system’s recall phase may use a variety of different recall strategies, such as content-based recall, collaborative filtering-based recall, popular item-based recall, interest tag-based recall, and so on. It is impossible to definitively determine which recall strategy is more important for items recalled by different recall strategies. Therefore, a learning-to-rank model is needed to rank the items recalled by multiple channels based on user behavior feedback, which is also a major function of the ranking module. Each recall channel can use A&#x2F;B testing to select the appropriate number. Users have different levels of interest in each channel of content, so the top-k parameter <code>k</code> for recall can also be personalized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-objective Fusion Ranking:</strong></p>
<p>Not only to improve CTR and CVR (Conversion Rate), but also retention, add-to-cart, and other multiple objectives. Different parameters are trained for different objectives, and the parameters of different objective models need to be manually adjusted. In addition, different objective models have different levels of importance, and there needs to be a personalized weight for each type of person. We can construct pairs of items generated by multiple objectives, and train the order of different items during training. Another method is to adopt multi-task learning, share parameters, and fuse the learned scores. Typical algorithms include Google’s MMOE (Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts) and Alibaba’s ESMM (Entire Space Multi-Task Model).</p>

<p>When it comes to interaction design, people most often think of website interaction design and app interaction design, while game interaction design seems relatively niche. Even in the interaction design courses of many universities, students are mostly exposed to the design of conventional products, and there is very little content on game interaction design.</p>
<p>As types of interaction design, game interaction and product interaction have many things in common. Their purpose is to improve usability and user experience. So what are the special features of game interaction that are different from product interaction?</p>
<h2 id="Landscape-Orientation"><a href="#Landscape-Orientation" class="headerlink" title="Landscape Orientation"></a>Landscape Orientation</h2><p>The first and most obvious difference is that many games adopt a landscape orientation. The natural difference between the horizontal and vertical holding postures determines the different hot zones for finger touch, and thus the layout of the interface functions will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>The main holding method of a vertical screen is one-handed, and the touch hot zone is mainly concentrated in the lower left. Of course, with the increase in the size of mobile phone screens, the holding method and the touch hot zone have also changed accordingly, which will not be discussed in this article.  In contrast, landscape screens are often held with two hands, and the natural activity areas of the left and right thumbs are the most convenient places for users to touch. Therefore, the main operation area of ​​the game is usually placed on the lower left and lower right, and the auxiliary function area is placed on the upper left and upper right. The top and bottom of the screen are more inclined to place some display information that does not require operation, as these areas are less accessible.</p>

<h2 id="Information-Hierarchy"><a href="#Information-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="Information Hierarchy"></a>Information Hierarchy</h2><p>In conventional app product design, the information density of each interface is usually controlled within a certain range, such as line spacing and font size, to ensure that users can easily identify and read under normal circumstances. Content of different information levels usually uses screen transitions. For example, the list page is one interface, and clicking to view details is another interface. The situation in games is very different, especially in core battle scenarios. Frequent screen transitions will not only put huge pressure on scene loading, but also greatly disrupt the user’s gaming experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are very few interface transitions in games, which requires interaction designers to pack a large amount of information into one interface. Game interaction needs to consider the size and layout of information more, use non-full-screen information windows more, and carefully sort out the transition levels of information and the impact of transitions on user experience.</p>
<h2 id="Operation-Guidance"><a href="#Operation-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Operation Guidance"></a>Operation Guidance</h2><p>The complexity of game operations also determines the importance of novice guidance in games. Product apps often only have brief guides when new features are added or revisions are made, while games will have a longer and carefully designed novice guidance process at the beginning. Game designers spend a lot of effort on the process, content, and form of novice guidance, in order to make it easier for users to get started and more willing to stay.</p>
<p>In addition to straightforward click prompts, explanatory text, etc., some implicit guides are also worth considering. For example, for the page turning method of a list, using arrow guidance or text description is too deliberate. We usually use the form of exposing a section of a row at the edge to remind users that there is more content. In fact, if you add some more details to the animation effect of the list, the list items appear from top to bottom in sequence, and the user can more naturally receive that the list is arranged vertically and should be turned up and down.</p>
<p>For example, we can attract users’ attention through light and dark contrast, dynamic and static contrast, etc., and guide users’ visual focus shift in a natural way. The way to choose a profession at the beginning of <em>Justice Online</em> is through a small bird. The bird takes off in a relatively static scene, and the user’s sight naturally focuses on the bird. When the bird flies to one of the professional characters, the user’s sight is also naturally taken to that character. This natural form of guidance can enhance the user’s sense of immersion more than directly using highlight effects.</p>

<h2 id="Emotion-and-Atmosphere"><a href="#Emotion-and-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Emotion and Atmosphere"></a>Emotion and Atmosphere</h2><p>How to render emotion and atmosphere is a key difference between game interaction and product interaction. Conventional products are more like a tool for users, assisting users’ lives in all aspects. Games are more like an escape from life for users. How to build a smooth user experience and reduce interruptions to enhance immersion is something that game interaction needs to consider. The integration of the interface atmosphere with the game world view, the cognitive consistency between the interaction method and the actual operation method, etc., can help enhance the user’s sense of immersion.</p>
<p>As game interaction designers, how to flexibly apply these methods to the design and enhance the immersion of the game through interaction still requires us to slowly explore through continuous attempts.</p>

    <title>The Setup and Effects of Tournaments in MMO Games</title>
    <url>/2019/10/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20191029_28584_844024/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191029/28584_844024.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the recently concluded Dota 2 “TI9 International Invitational Tournament”, the OG team from Europe defended their title, breaking the curse of no same player or same team winning twice in years. It was also these same five young men who, for the first time, shattered the myth that Chinese teams won every even-numbered year at the TI8 arena last year, crushing the dreams of countless Chinese Dota fans. In addition to endless glory, they also brought in more than $10 million in championship bonuses each year (TI9’s total prize pool exceeded $30 million, with the champion team receiving 45.5% of it, more than $14 million, which also broke the prize record set by TI itself last year) and hundreds of millions of viewers per day.</p>
<p>Dota 2, which was dubbed “Dead Game” by “Principal” Wang Sicong several years ago, has maintained many world records precisely because of its relatively complete tournament system. It cannot but be said to be one of the miracles in the history of e-sports.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2F0c831b56-6714-4832-87cd-9344e88288b5.jpg/size/" alt="TI9 International Invitational was held in Shanghai, China"></p>
<p>However, unlike games such as DotA and CSGO, which test skills, tournaments cannot be used as a core eye-catching and money-making method in MMO games. The main reasons include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Compared with MOBA, shooting and other operational games, MMO game players are more diverse. In addition to the battle power players who pursue the thrill of PK, there are also a large number of players who pursue social interaction, exploration, appearance and other gameplays. Therefore, tournaments cannot be an eye-catching method for all players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a battle power development game, the core method of improving battle power in MMO games is still氪金 (kèjīn - pay to win) and 肝 (gān - grinding), and relatively speaking, the player’s operation and skills have a relatively slight impact on the results. Therefore, for traditional MMO games, tournaments will not be used as the main means of attracting traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2Fde8c4aaa-8dda-4db4-8e61-1897245be3cd.jpg/size/" alt="NetEase MMO game &quot;Fantasy Westward Journey&quot; National PK Championship"></p>
<p>However, this does not mean that there is no place for tournaments in MMO games at all. In fact, there are still a considerable number of players who are willing to watch the “fairies fight” of various masters in the game. And in recent years, watching live broadcasts has become more and more a trend. For most players, they can satisfy their desire to “experience” the fun of master players through live broadcasts of tournaments. In addition, they can also learn the operation techniques and detail control of master players in tournaments.</p>
<p>Taking <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile (倩女幽魂手游 - Qiànnǚ Yōuhún Shǒuyóu)</em> as an example, a variety of tournament types have been launched, including the “Cross-Server Star Tournament” series specially created for big R players and the “National Championship” where all players compete fairly and test the players’ details and operations more.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2Faa10fe4a-cd90-460e-9635-eeb9fedd0011.jpg/size/" alt="A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Cross-Server Star Tournament"></p>
<p>For the “Cross-Server Star Tournament”, stricter restrictions are imposed on the registration conditions: only players with VIP level 18 or above can form a team to register. But this also ensures the luxurious level of the contestants’ equipment and improves the watchability of the tournament.</p>
<p>Compared with the “Cross-Server Star Tournament” where money is king, the “National Championship” pays more attention to the players’ control of details and the level of operation. The “National Championship” has almost no entry restrictions. All registered players can create accounts according to their profession on the exclusive tournament server, and all created accounts have the same level and equipment with the same or similar ratings for players to freely adjust and replace, and they can freely form teams to register. In the tournament, in addition to pursuing the ultimate equality, all accounts are equipped with “nuclear weapon-level” equipment, which can make players truly experience the top enjoyment of master players.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2F55b90b2c-9ec8-4601-aa02-ccfc3ca708fd.jpg/size/" alt="A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile National Championship"></p>
<p>In MMO game tournaments, if the participating teams win the top four, they will receive cash rewards of up to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan, as well as exclusive in-game props, titles and other rewards. Other players can interact by watching live broadcasts and participating in quizzes.</p>
<p>In addition, the finals of the “National Championship” are held offline together with the “A Chinese Ghost Story Carnival”. Players can purchase tickets in the game to meet the master players face-to-face, and players who cannot arrive at the scene can also watch the live broadcast in the game to cheer for their favorite teams.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191029%2F8fb4bdbe-ac4a-4d92-83b9-8bd75193cb7e.jpg/size/" alt="A Chinese Ghost Story Mobile Carnival"></p>
<p>Therefore, although tournaments are not a core means of attracting traffic for MMO games, through reasonable tournament settings and player interaction methods, they can still greatly enhance the player’s experience in the game.</p>

    <title>Battle Pass System Design in Games</title>
    <url>/2019/11/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20191104_28584_846575/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191104/28584_846575.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>What is a Battle Pass? It’s a fantastic payment design from <em>Fortnite</em> that has swept across various games, such as the Honor Pass system in <em>Honor of Kings</em>, the season pass in <em>PUBG Mobile</em>, the Battle Pass in <em>Apex Legends</em>, and so on. It can be said that the design of the Battle Pass is another revolution in the game payment model after the design of loot boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2F6141799c-3ee8-4dfe-bcb4-31f59c24bd16.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;6141799c-3ee8-4dfe-bcb4-31f59c24bd16.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2F92d1422c-4920-4a87-8a29-48b94a1ef547.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;92d1422c-4920-4a87-8a29-48b94a1ef547.jpg"></p>
<p>Looking at the major payment models of games, such as <em>Monument Valley</em>, a single-player game, the revenue mainly relies on “tickets”; such as <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, an MMORPG game, the revenue mainly relies on a small number of big spenders; such as casual games like <em>Candy Crush</em>, the revenue is mainly the transaction of consumables; such as <em>Onmyoji</em>, a card game, the revenue is mainly from gacha, similarly <em>Overwatch</em>‘s loot boxes and <em>Hearthstone</em>‘s card packs; there are also ways to earn revenue such as skin sales.</p>
<p>Each payment model has its advantages and limitations. For example, the skin itself has very low appeal to many players who focus on practicality. The method of gacha loot boxes has the same drawbacks as the skin payment method on the one hand, and the gacha of pure card games has greater limitations on the core of the game itself. So how does the Battle Pass work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2Faf3e32ba-b3d8-4dca-b149-71c0be5918fe.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;af3e32ba-b3d8-4dca-b149-71c0be5918fe.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2Fcd4173c5-516d-4172-b481-8678be7a865e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;cd4173c5-516d-4172-b481-8678be7a865e.jpg"></p>
<p>This mechanism is divided into two modes: free version and paid version.</p>
<p>Free-to-play players can earn experience by completing tasks and other methods in the game, and accumulate levels to obtain corresponding level rewards; at the same time, they can also purchase the paid version to unlock more rewards at the corresponding experience level; of course, they can also directly purchase experience to obtain rewards.</p>
<p>It can be found that under this mechanism, the more players play, the more rewards they get, and the greater the temptation to purchase the paid version. At the same time, once the paid version is purchased, players will be very eager to reach the final grand prize, so they will stay in the game for a longer time, or directly spend money to “buy time”.</p>
<p>At the same time, this mechanism has a very big advantage. Its payment is separated from the core of the game itself, which means that payment will not impact the game balance, which is very friendly to players with low spending. In addition, this method of getting on the bus first and then buying a ticket is far more likely to give players the urge to pay than the method of buying a ticket first and then getting on the bus. At its root, this is a model that accumulates rewards for players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2F2ddc7789-6167-4c20-9490-4366cb4a838b.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;2ddc7789-6167-4c20-9490-4366cb4a838b.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2F7ff0817b-ee24-4988-be25-30cba7434064.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;7ff0817b-ee24-4988-be25-30cba7434064.jpg"></p>
<p>From the theory of game design, our core is to hope that players can be “addicted” to our games, that is, to improve players’ interactivity and stickiness, so that users develop usage habits. The HOOKED model explains and illustrates the operating mechanism of “addiction”.</p>
<p>The hooked model mainly includes four stages: trigger, action, variable rewards, and investment. Trigger refers to the inducement that prompts users to take action. For example, the level 1 reward of the Battle Pass is often very generous and attractive. At the same time, as players continue to play the game, they will always be prompted to receive corresponding level rewards for free, and at the same time, they will be prompted that the paid rewards are more generous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2Fb0830a47-b203-4a22-b05e-3e437037d61c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;b0830a47-b203-4a22-b05e-3e437037d61c.jpg"></p>
<p>In action, as players continue to play the game, they will get closer and closer to completing the stage goal (next level&#x2F;final level). At this time, the motivation to complete the task will be stronger. Through the design of Battle Pass level rewards, a more attractive reward is set every few levels, and a higher attractive reward is set at level 1 and the highest level. Of course, in this process, players constantly receive rewards. Variable rewards can meet the needs of users and stimulate users’ desire to use; and constantly invest time, money, etc., investment will form user preferences, because users tend to overestimate their labor results, and try to be consistent with their past behavior to produce psychological associations and automatically take action, these are all converted into sunk costs that affect the player’s judgment, and promote the player to continuously enter such a cycle of addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191104%2Fcf5c621a-bd5c-4c60-bb40-d27f49710250.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20191104&#x2F;cf5c621a-bd5c-4c60-bb40-d27f49710250.jpg"></p>
<p>In the design of the Battle Pass, the most core and important thing is, first of all, the display of the next “small goal”, which is the direct driving force to attract players. Secondly, for players who have not upgraded, the overall comparison of rewards in the two modes is also an important driving force to promote players to pay. As the level increases, players will feel that they have missed more rewards, attracting players to pay. In addition, the arrangement and level distribution of sub-tabs such as tasks and exchanges in the system also need to be simplified to reduce the difficulty of understanding and operation for players.</p>
<p>The Battle Pass payment model has gradually matured after more than a year, and there is also more commercial potential to be tapped.</p>

    <title>What is the Core Experience of a Game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20191105_28584_846836/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191105/28584_846836.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, a game advertisement swept the country and became a popular online phrase:</p>
<p><em>“This is a brand new version you haven’t played before. Just experience it for three minutes, and you will be like me, loving this game…”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F1d61bc7f-a448-4b15-b38e-da21d27f115b.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was a successful brainwashing campaign. Many netizens imitated the accent of the spokesperson. Besides the popular catchphrase, there is one point worth pondering: Why would someone fall in love with this game after just 3 minutes of experience? What do players experience in these 3 minutes?</p>
<p>This is the topic of our discussion today: the core experience of a game.</p>
<p>The core experience carries the core fun of the game. Take <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em> (<em>New Ghost</em>) as an example, an MMO game that has been operating for 8 years. When many people talk about this game, they will mention social interaction. There are many players who like to make friends, find partners, decorate their homes, and chat in the game, rather than discussing PK skills.</p>
<p>So, is social interaction the core experience of <em>New Ghost</em>? No. At low levels, players are almost always playing solo, running through storylines and tasks. Guilds are something that come after level 25. Then is growth the core experience? No, either. Why do players want to grow? Ultimately, it is because they want to improve their strength so that they can defeat bosses and PK with other players, which is – combat. The reason why players continue to play is that the combat is exciting, defeating monsters is exciting, and “killing” is exciting.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F555dd04a-f8e1-467c-8c3e-0b02214c33fd.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>When we want to extract the core of a game, the simplest method is subtraction.</p>
<p><em>New Ghost</em> can be without the guild system, without the marriage system, and even without the chat box, but it cannot be without combat.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the core experience of <em>New Ghost</em> and <em>Honor of Kings</em> is the same: kill, defeat the opponent, and achieve combat victory.</p>
<p>In other words, the core experience must be repeatable and expandable. A player can repeatedly experience it from entering the game to leaving the game.</p>
<p>The core experience determines the type of game. Obviously, <em>Shining Nikki</em> and <em>Knives Out</em> are two different types of games. The former is a dress-up and nurturing game, while the latter is a tactical competition game. Different core experiences attract different types of players. In 2018, the average number of active users in the Chinese game market reached 280 million (MobData Research Institute, 2018). In the segmented market, MOBA and shooting games are evenly matched, and puzzle and parkour games also occupy a large market share.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191105%2F6873ff1d-4644-4e9a-a0a3-5e47e118bf0b.jpg/size/" alt="image"></p>
<p>The most important thing for game developers at the beginning of game design is to determine the core experience of their game. This affects what kind of players will become the target players, whether they can accept the game, whether they are willing to try and continue to experience it, and it is also an important way to find a blue ocean.</p>
<p>A breakthrough and innovative core experience design can often help the game gain a leading position in the industry and reap unexpected rewards.</p>
<p>So, the core experience of the game is so important, what kind of support can we provide as user experience researchers?</p>
<p>If the game has not been officially launched or is still in a state of flux, congratulations, you are likely to find a way to success for the game at this time. For example, through concept testing, the product can understand what players are interested in and what they want at an early stage.</p>
<p>If the game has taken shape, a complete novice test can test the ease of getting started with the game and understand whether players can enjoy the core of the game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, there are thousands of methods. Grasping the core experience of the game is grasping the soul of the game.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191112/28584_848135.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>As a very important category in game user experience testing, “scream-degree” testing has always been a powerful tool for evaluating the quality of gameplay during the project initiation period.</p>
<p>Many companies are also using this system for project rating and filtering. The many indicators in this system are crucial and are highly correlated with the market performance of the project after its launch.</p>
<p>Starting from 2013, known as the first year of mobile games, major manufacturers began to comprehensively deploy in the mobile game market, accelerating their speed to seize the opportunity. This scene of competing powers also led to the explosion of the mobile game market in 2014.</p>
<p>Consequently, this market situation also raised the production cost of mobile games to an unprecedented level. The result is that the competition to create a high-quality mobile game product that is acceptable to the market has become very fierce.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the strategy of major manufacturers to fully deploy in mobile games and the rising overall development costs have created a situation that runs counter to each other. If you want to blossom everywhere and save costs to increase profits, the risk is too great for every company.</p>
<p>Full-scale deployment is a good thing, but not every product will be successful. So you need to “use good steel on the blade.” Within the limited annual development budget, how to develop mobile game products that are most likely to be accepted by the market is a question that every manufacturer wants to try to figure out.</p>
<p>In this process, “scream-degree testing” emerged and began to establish a stable and convincing mechanism for project evaluation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191112%2F70e45727-48ff-4b60-a5ed-060856ab7d1a.jpg/size/" alt="Scream-degree Test"></p>
<p>The so-called “scream-degree test” is to use a minimized version of the Demo containing the most core experience and gameplay of the product before the product is officially launched and starts to be developed vigorously. It collects indicators that can reflect the quality of the product’s core gameplay and future market potential, as well as player expectations, in the form of street interviews, and uses them for project rating and filtering.</p>
<p>Through this filtering, we can more effectively invest more manpower, capital, etc., into products that are more likely to succeed in the future, and focus on deploying in core strategic markets.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191112%2F581ce8eb-faf4-4efb-ac2d-dac145a2ff09.jpg/size/" alt="Street Intercept"></p>
<p>Everyone may have a question, why is this system called “scream-degree test” instead of “satisfaction test” or “fun test”?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. Based on the above, the purpose of this test is to select products that can thrive in the future market as much as possible during the project’s infancy. Compared with the “satisfaction” survey of players’ satisfaction with the game (which itself may have an evaluation standard), the “scream-degree” tests the players’ “excitement” for the game, whether the game is beyond the players’ expectations, and whether it can make the players scream “OMG, buy it”. This is what we need to achieve in the test.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191112%2F07c7d792-0ed1-4e00-bd21-a5c8d2e3ae2d.jpg/size/" alt="OMG, buy it"></p>
<p>If 2013 was a year of explosion for mobile games, then by 2018 and 2019, the red ocean market for domestic mobile games had also arrived. Without the demographic dividend, without the device dividend, and even without the policy dividend, the difficulty of obtaining game licenses is also increasing.</p>
<p>So, what are the major game manufacturers considering now? Going global. Using their own R&amp;D strength and their vision and research on overseas markets, many domestic manufacturers have begun to continuously develop or directly distribute to overseas markets. In the process of this strategic adjustment, “scream-degree testing” is also an indispensable part. Because no one will think that the competition in foreign markets is much smaller than that in the domestic market.</p>
<p>You know, although the cost of acquiring users for Chinese mobile games is higher than that in Southeast Asia and other places, it is still much lower than that in relatively developed and mature countries in Europe, America, or East Asia. This also means that the cost of user acquisition after the game goes overseas is still a major barrier to entry. In terms of core gameplay, to win the favor of users, we also need to understand what they think about the game.</p>
<p>We recently had a new casual game project, planning to go overseas for distribution. Accordingly, according to the company’s internal project initiation process, we also planned this “scream-degree test for foreign players” together.</p>
<p>In order to improve the efficiency of the test and provide quick review and decision-making support for the decision-making level, we chose to conduct street intercepts of foreign players in Hangzhou.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191112%2F6ed87df4-f99d-46d9-9154-af20a751bdef.jpg/size/" alt="Hangzhou Street Intercept"></p>
<p>The main locations considered include the bar streets where foreigners in Hangzhou mainly hang out, the international student teaching buildings and dormitories of various university campuses, the office buildings where foreign working people hang out, the major business districts in the city center, some famous scenic spots along the West Lake, and some personal resources, such as the game night that the user researcher participates in.</p>
<p>We combined the time when foreigners appear and tactically carried out “surprise attacks” at various locations. For example, in office buildings, we tried to conduct street intercepts at noon or dusk, which can effectively improve the efficiency of intercepts and the hit rate of players; for example, on university campuses, we mainly conducted intercepts in the afternoon when international students were leaving class, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20191112%2Fbb4387c8-ac1b-4c3a-8238-0a57c73324c8.jpg/size/" alt="University Campus Street Intercept"></p>
<p>Of course, we will strictly control the demographic ratio, such as male and female players, working people and students, in the execution of the test in combination with the product positioning. In this way, the information we collect will be more convincing. The specific implementation method we adopted was to record with a mobile app and manually record the players’ specific verbal feedback and operational problems.</p>
<p>Overall, the scream-degree test for foreign players is much more difficult than for domestic players. In the later stage, we will also gradually develop scream-degree tests for foreigners in other cities, including some overseas cities. North America, Japan, and some countries in Southeast Asia are important markets for games to go overseas. Conducting tests in these local areas and collecting the most authentic feedback from players is also one of the strategies we will continue to implement.</p>

    <title>The Intertwined Relationships of Various Tools in Data Analysis</title>
    <url>/2019/11/06/netease-ux-articles/news_20191108_28584_847506/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20191108/28584_847506.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="I-SQL"><a href="#I-SQL" class="headerlink" title="I. SQL"></a>I. SQL</h2><p>SQL is probably the most used tool in data analysis. It is easy to learn and widely applicable, making it a favorite among “SQL boys” and “SQL girls.” If there’s an anomaly in a certain metric, an “SQL baby” can handle it. Not only can SQL be used to obtain the change in metric data, but it can also analyze the reasons for the change. All of this relies on SQL. The following uses Hive SQL as an example to discuss the level of SQL proficiency required to meet basic business needs.</p>
<p><strong>1. Basic Common Syntax is a Must</strong></p>
<p>What are the basic common syntaxes? For example, various join types in query statements (inner join, left join, right join, full join, etc.), equality and inequality joins (on, where), group by, order by, count, sum, common window functions, etc.; as well as table creation (create table), table deletion statements (delete, drop), etc. These will not be elaborated on here.</p>
<p><strong>2. Time Functions</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) datediff: A function that calculates the interval between two dates</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- Example: Calculate the number of days between two dates</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> DATEDIFF(<span class="string">&#x27;2023-10-27&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;2023-10-20&#x27;</span>); <span class="comment">-- Output: 7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>(2) from_unixtime() and unix_timestamp(): Conversion between 10-digit timestamps and time formats</strong></p>
<p><code>from_unixtime()</code></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- Example: Convert a 10-digit timestamp to a formatted date and time</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> FROM_UNIXTIME(<span class="number">1698388800</span>);  <span class="comment">-- Output: (e.g.,) 2023-10-27 12:00:00</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><code>unix_timestamp()</code></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- Example: Convert a formatted date and time to a 10-digit timestamp</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> UNIX_TIMESTAMP(<span class="string">&#x27;2023-10-27 12:00:00&#x27;</span>); <span class="comment">-- Output: 1698388800</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example: Convert a date (without time) to a 10-digit timestamp (midnight)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> UNIX_TIMESTAMP(<span class="string">&#x27;2023-10-27&#x27;</span>);  <span class="comment">-- Output: (e.g., ) 1698345600</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: 10-digit timestamps and 13-digit timestamps are different.  The former is in <em>seconds</em>, the latter in <em>milliseconds</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(3) to_date(): Extracts only the year, month, and day</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">select</span> to_date(<span class="string">&#x27;2019-11-08 18:08:08&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Result</span>:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2019</span><span class="number">-11</span><span class="number">-08</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>(4) In addition, there are many other time functions, such as date_add, pmod, etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Functions for Secondary Processing of Fields</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) concat: Connects multiple strings into one string.</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> CONCAT(<span class="string">&#x27;Hello&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27; &#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;World&#x27;</span>); <span class="comment">--Output: Hello World</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There are also related functions like <code>concat_ws()</code> (concat with separator), <code>group_concat()</code> (concatenates values from multiple rows into one string), etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(2) split: Splits a field</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">select</span> split(<span class="string">&#x27;1#2#3#4&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;#&#x27;</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The above splits into a list. Marking the list index can select the corresponding field.</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example: Access element at index 1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> SPLIT(<span class="string">&#x27;apple,banana,orange&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;,&#x27;</span>)[<span class="number">0</span>]; <span class="comment">-- Output: apple</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">Result</span>:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;1&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In addition, <code>size</code>, <code>length</code>, and <code>explode</code> are often used in conjunction with <code>split</code>. Among them, <code>explode</code> is commonly used for converting rows to columns after character splitting.</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">select</span> explode(split(<span class="string">&#x27;1#2#3#4&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;#&#x27;</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>4. Regular Expressions</strong></p>
<p>SQL statements can also be used with regular expressions as query conditions, which is very useful. This part is relatively detailed, so just look it up when you need it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="II-Python"><a href="#II-Python" class="headerlink" title="II. Python"></a>II. Python</h2><p>Sometimes SQL is not enough to support the entire data analysis process. For example, when you need to compare and analyze samples, Python comes into play.</p>
<p>You need to master the use of common libraries in Python, such as NumPy, pandas, and SciPy. It is best to familiarize yourself with them by implementing basic statistical methods. In addition, learning to use lists, dictionaries, functions, and classes well will be very helpful for the flexible use of Python in daily life. For example, when the amount of data is very large and you need to iterate through row data, lists or dictionaries are much faster than pandas in processing data.</p>
<p>Based on different needs and scenarios, the use of Python varies. The following only shows the basic operation flow:</p>
<p><strong>1. Data Reading and Character Processing</strong></p>
<p>Flexible use of multiple reading methods</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="built_in">open</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;data.txt&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;r&#x27;</span>) <span class="keyword">as</span> f:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> line <span class="keyword">in</span> f:</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment"># Process each line</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">print</span>(line.strip())</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="keyword">as</span> pd</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">df = pd.read_csv(<span class="string">&#x27;data.csv&#x27;</span>)  <span class="comment"># Or pd.read_excel, pd.read_table, etc.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(df)</span><br><span class="line">Method <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">python</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#If connecting directly to a database.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> sqlite3 <span class="comment">#Example, could be a different database driver.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">conn = sqlite3.connect(<span class="string">&#x27;mydatabase.db&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">cursor = conn.cursor()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">cursor.execute(<span class="string">&quot;SELECT * FROM mytable&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">data = cursor.fetchall()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#OR</span></span><br><span class="line">data = pd.read_sql_query(<span class="string">&quot;SELECT * FROM mytable&quot;</span>, conn)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">conn.close()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**<span class="number">2.</span> Data Processing (The processing process depends on the situation <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> shown below)**</span><br><span class="line">**<span class="number">3.</span> Result Output**</span><br><span class="line">python</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">with</span> <span class="built_in">open</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;output.txt&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;w&#x27;</span>) <span class="keyword">as</span> f:</span><br><span class="line">    f.write(<span class="string">&quot;Results:\n&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Write results to the file</span></span><br><span class="line">    f.write(<span class="string">&quot;...&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And using the <code>to_csv</code> function in the pandas library, etc.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="keyword">as</span> pd</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#Assume &#x27;results&#x27; is a pandas Dataframe.</span></span><br><span class="line">results = pd.DataFrame(&#123;<span class="string">&#x27;col1&#x27;</span>: [<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>], <span class="string">&#x27;col2&#x27;</span>: [<span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">4</span>]&#125;) <span class="comment">#Example</span></span><br><span class="line">results.to_csv(<span class="string">&#x27;output.csv&#x27;</span>, index=<span class="literal">False</span>) <span class="comment">#Avoid writing the index</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Of course, everyone has their own habits, and good methods are those that are easy to use!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="III-Collaboration-Between-Python-and-SQL"><a href="#III-Collaboration-Between-Python-and-SQL" class="headerlink" title="III. Collaboration Between Python and SQL"></a>III. Collaboration Between Python and SQL</h2><p>Hive’s custom functions support Transform and UDF. UDF is to package and upload Java code. If you don’t want to write Java code, you can use Transform, write a script, and process it through the script.</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">--Example.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">add</span> file test.py; <span class="comment">-- Add the Python script to the distributed cache.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span></span><br><span class="line">  TRANSFORM (field1, field2, field3)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">USING</span> <span class="string">&#x27;python test.py&#x27;</span>  <span class="comment">-- Specifies the Python script to use.  It MUST be executable (chmod +x test.py)</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">AS</span> (field4, field5)  <span class="comment">-- Specifies the output columns and their names.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">FROM</span> mytable;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Among them, <code>transform(field1, field2, field3)</code> contains the three columns of data that need to be processed, which are the results directly queried by <code>select</code>. The above results are processed through the <code>test.py</code> file, and two columns of data, namely <code>field4</code> and <code>field5</code>, are output. The python script <code>test.py</code> will receive the input data on <code>stdin</code>, process each row, and output the result to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="IV-Others"><a href="#IV-Others" class="headerlink" title="IV. Others"></a>IV. Others</h2><p><strong>1. Data Visualization: R, Excel</strong></p>
<p>Most data visualizations can be completed using Excel charting. However, if you want to be more sophisticated and create violin plots, box plots, etc., you need to use R. You can learn about this on your own.</p>
<p><strong>2. Linux, Bash, Hadoop</strong></p>
<p>Many data analysis tasks now use big data platforms. If you still have energy after learning the above, you might as well take a look at Linux, Bash, and Hadoop. You don’t need to learn in depth at the beginning, but you can familiarize yourself with the basic operation statements, which will be more handy in future work.</p>

<p>This sharing focuses on data mining and modeling in data analysis:</p>
<p>After data exploration and data preprocessing, we obtain data that can be directly modeled. According to the mining objectives and data format, we can establish models such as classification and prediction, cluster analysis, association rules, time series patterns, and deviation detection.</p>
<h2 id="Classification-and-Prediction"><a href="#Classification-and-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="Classification and Prediction"></a>Classification and Prediction</h2><p>Classification and prediction are two main types of prediction problems. Classification mainly predicts class labels (discrete attributes), while prediction mainly establishes continuous value function models to predict the value of the dependent variable corresponding to a given independent variable.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-Implementation-Process"><a href="#1-1-Implementation-Process" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Implementation Process"></a>1.1 Implementation Process</h3><p>(1) Classification is to construct a classification model, input the attribute values of the sample, and output the corresponding category, mapping each sample to a predefined category.</p>
<p>The classification model is also established on the existing labeled data set, and the accuracy of the model on the existing samples can be easily calculated, which belongs to supervised learning.</p>
<p>(2) Prediction refers to establishing a functional model of interdependence between two or more variables, and then making predictions or controls.</p>
<p>(3) Implementation process</p>
<p>The first step of classification is the learning step, which establishes a classification model to obtain classification rules through inductive analysis of the training sample set. The second step is the classification step, which first uses a known test sample set to evaluate the accuracy of the classification rules and make predictions.</p>
<p>The first step of prediction is to establish a functional model of predictive attributes through the training set. The second step is to perform prediction or control after the model has passed the test.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-Common-Classification-and-Prediction-Algorithms"><a href="#1-2-Common-Classification-and-Prediction-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Common Classification and Prediction Algorithms"></a>1.2 Common Classification and Prediction Algorithms</h3><p>① <strong>Regression analysis:</strong> Regression analysis is the most common statistical method to determine the quantitative relationship between predictive attributes (numerical) and other variables. It includes linear and nonlinear regression, Logistic regression, ridge regression, principal component regression, partial least squares regression, etc.</p>
<p>② <strong>Decision tree:</strong> Adopts a top-down recursive method, compares attribute values at internal nodes, and branches down from the node according to different attribute values. The leaf node finally obtained is the class of learning division.</p>
<p>③ <strong>Artificial neural network:</strong> An artificial neural network is an information processing system established by imitating the structure and function of the brain’s neural network. It is a model that represents the relationship between the input and output variables of the neural network.</p>

<p>Note: Linear regression models are usually relatively simple regression models, but the independent and dependent variables can have some form of curved relationship, requiring the creation of a nonlinear regression model.</p>
<p>① <strong>Logistic Regression Analysis Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Logistic function: In the logistic regression model, the dependent variable has only two values, 0 and 1. The logarithm is taken after taking the event ratio, and the function is obtained:</p>
<p>  <code>log(p/(1-p)) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 +...+ βpXp</code></p>
<p>② <strong>Modeling Steps:</strong> First, set indicator variables according to the analysis objectives, then collect data and screen features; list the regression equation and estimate the regression coefficients in the model; perform model testing, including accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and KS value; model application, input the value of the independent variable, you can get the value of the predicted variable, or control the value of the independent variable according to the value of the predicted variable.</p>
<p>For example: Logistic regression modeling based on the data of a certain bank in reducing loan delinquency rate.</p>
<p>Use scikit-learn to perform logistic regression analysis on the data. First, perform feature selection. For example, simply use the F-test value to give the F value and P value of each feature, and select the one with a larger F value or a smaller P value. Secondly, there are recursive feature elimination and stability selection. Here, the random logistic regression in the stability selection method is used. First, feature selection, and then use the selected features to establish a logistic regression model and output the average accuracy rate.</p>
<p>The example code is as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># coding=utf-8</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="keyword">as</span> pd</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> sklearn.linear_model <span class="keyword">import</span> LogisticRegression <span class="keyword">as</span> LR</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> sklearn.linear_model <span class="keyword">import</span> RandomizedLogisticRegression <span class="keyword">as</span> RLR</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Parameter initialization</span></span><br><span class="line">filename = <span class="string">&#x27;Data and Code/chapter5/demo/data/bankloan.xls&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line">data = pd.read_excel(filename)</span><br><span class="line">x = data.iloc[:, :<span class="number">8</span>].values  <span class="comment"># Use .as_matrix() for earlier versions of Pandas</span></span><br><span class="line">y = data.iloc[:, <span class="number">8</span>].values  <span class="comment"># Use .as_matrix() for earlier versions of Pandas</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">rlr = RLR(selection_threshold=<span class="number">0.5</span>)  <span class="comment"># Establish a random logistic regression model to screen variables # Adjust the threshold</span></span><br><span class="line">rlr.fit(x, y)  <span class="comment"># Train the model</span></span><br><span class="line">selected_features = rlr.get_support()  <span class="comment"># Get the index of the selected features</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">u&#x27;The feature names after feature selection by random logistic regression are:&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">u&#x27;,&#x27;</span>.join(data.columns[:-<span class="number">1</span>][selected_features]))  <span class="comment"># Use data.columns[:-1] to remove the last column (target variable)</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">x = data[data.columns[:-<span class="number">1</span>][selected_features]].values  <span class="comment"># Use .as_matrix() for earlier versions of Pandas</span></span><br><span class="line">lr = LR()  <span class="comment"># Establish a logistic regression model</span></span><br><span class="line">lr.fit(x, y)  <span class="comment"># Train the model with the selected features</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">u&#x27;The model is built successfully.&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">u&#x27;The average accuracy rate is：%s&#x27;</span> % lr.score(x, y))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>After running, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>Effective features are: salary, address, debt ratio, credit card debt</p>
<p>From the results, it can be seen that the random logistic regression is used to eliminate variables, and x2, x8, x1, and x5 are eliminated respectively. The final model has four columns left, where the random threshold is 0.25, and this program uses 0.5.</p>
<p>Logistic regression is essentially a linear model. The model validity test here is essentially a linear test, that is, the selected variables have a strong linear correlation with the result, and the selected ones are not necessarily irrelevant, and may be non-linearly related.</p>
<p>For the selection of non-linearly related variables, there are decision trees, neural networks, etc., which is another field of knowledge.</p>

    <title>A New Beginning for Motion-Sensing Games</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201022/28584_911461.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="The-Beginning-of-Motion-Sensing-Games"><a href="#The-Beginning-of-Motion-Sensing-Games" class="headerlink" title="The Beginning of Motion-Sensing Games"></a>The Beginning of Motion-Sensing Games</h2><p>Motion-sensing games are not a new thing. As early as the beginning of video games, arcade games were the biggest promoters of motion-sensing games. Experiencing games with your body, the meaning of motion-sensing games is as literal as it sounds.</p>
<p>If you were to ask what the first well-known motion-sensing game was, Nintendo’s “Duck Hunt” on the NES sold 30 million copies. In that era of scarce game performance, without exquisite graphics and a vivid virtual world, motion-sensing elements could be said to be the most obvious way to enhance the gaming experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Ffd8874c3-7f76-4475-871b-3f31a8443511.jpg/size/" alt="fd8874c3-7f76-4475-871b-3f31a8443511.jpg"></p>
<p>Motion-sensing games rely heavily on specialized, unique input devices. This requires players who want to experience motion-sensing games to purchase expensive equipment to play, and these devices cannot support other games. From the very beginning of motion-sensing games, its advantages and disadvantages have been exposed. People cannot play motion-sensing games for a long time, nor can they play them lying in bed. The interaction form of motion-sensing games brings fun to players, but also brings experience problems: inaccurate recognition, discomfort caused by physical exertion, and space limitations.</p>
<p>The history of motion-sensing games is a game of trade-offs, how to make the interactive experience more interesting, and also make the input hardware more versatile. Or rather, the key problem that motion-sensing games need to solve is to find the best input device for controlling body movements. Personal computers require a mouse and keyboard, TV consoles cannot do without gamepads, and mobile phone interaction is based on touch screens. So what should the interactive device for motion-sensing games be?</p>
<h2 id="Expectation-and-Disappointment"><a href="#Expectation-and-Disappointment" class="headerlink" title="Expectation and Disappointment"></a>Expectation and Disappointment</h2><p>Then, time came to 2006, and Nintendo, which once used a laser gun to hunt ducks, came with its “big baby” again. Nintendo’s internal code name was “The Revolution”, and the TV console Wii, based on the concept of motion sensing and home entertainment mode, was released, with sales of 20 million units in the first year. As of December 2018, the cumulative global sales of Wii reached 101.63 million units, and 920.66 million copies of games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F2fc96b70-2e6e-4f72-b183-d69e4cfbf355.jpg/size/" alt="2fc96b70-2e6e-4f72-b183-d69e4cfbf355.jpg"></p>
<p>This console was conceived after the launch of GAMECUBE in 2001.</p>
<p>Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview that the plan at the time focused on a new way of interaction between the game console and the player.</p>
<p>The consensus at the time was that hardware capabilities were not the entirety of a game console. The market cannot allow too many high-performance consoles to coexist at the same time. Just like if there were only ferocious carnivorous dinosaurs on the earth, they might kill each other, eventually leading to their own extinction.”</p>
<p>Wii was very successful in that era, and it was from Wii that motion-sensing games entered a climax. Microsoft and Sony have successively launched their own motion-sensing kits. It seems that consoles without motion-sensing functions cannot be called good consoles. But each company also has its own views on how motion sensing should be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="Is-the-Motion-Controller-the-Future"><a href="#Is-the-Motion-Controller-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Is the Motion Controller the Future?"></a>Is the Motion Controller the Future?</h2><p>The motion-sensing interaction mode proposed by Nintendo relies on its motion-sensing controller. This is also a major interactive mode of motion sensing in the following ten years. The main difference of the motion-sensing controller lies in the use of gravity sensing and accelerometer sensors, so that the controller can sense the player’s waving action, as well as the approximate position and movement direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F1ac1aea0-ef7d-4765-afa4-b2aba81fa872.jpg/size/" alt="1ac1aea0-ef7d-4765-afa4-b2aba81fa872.jpg"></p>
<p>The advantage of the motion controller is that it is less affected by the environment. As long as the player holds it in his hand, he can operate freely. Secondly, with different device extensions, the shape and holding posture can be switched according to different game types, simulating the player’s physical touch in the game to a greater extent. But its disadvantages are also obvious. It cannot capture the player’s complete motion information. For example, in the “Just Dance” game, although the game requires corresponding actions to score, many times you can get a high score as long as you wave the controller according to the rhythm. At the same time, the gamepad also limits the number of operation inputs. In the simulated driving game, players can only control the direction, and the speed control can only be controlled by the computer. This greatly affects the original gameplay of the game. Because of this, there has never been a truly hardcore work in motion-sensing games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F03b4071a-a64d-4f6a-accb-df3de8310a0f.jpg/size/" alt="03b4071a-a64d-4f6a-accb-df3de8310a0f.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Motion-Capture-and-Gesture-Interaction"><a href="#Motion-Capture-and-Gesture-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Motion Capture and Gesture Interaction"></a>Motion Capture and Gesture Interaction</h2><p>In 2010, in order to catch up with the sales of Nintendo’s Wii console, Microsoft finally brought their motion-sensing device-Kinect. Kinect adopts a completely different interactive approach. It does not rely on any physical devices. Players only need to stand in front of the camera to capture the player’s complete body movements. Even on Kinect 2.0, the accuracy and effect of this capture are very good. In addition to motion capture, Kinect’s dot-matrix microphone also supports voice control. The high-tech Kinect created a world record for sales at the time, and even now it still is.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F07e92e64-5eee-4c7b-a92a-0a534f665a91.jpg/size/" alt="07e92e64-5eee-4c7b-a92a-0a534f665a91.jpg"></p>
<p>On Kinect, players control the cursor by the position of their hands, and holding is a click operation. They can also wave to do page turning and return operations. Gesture operation has always been considered a very cool interactive method by players, but many interactive studies show that the learning cost of gesture interaction is very high, and everyone’s understanding of gestures lacks basic consensus and habits. Secondly, gesture interaction itself cannot be precise, and it will also bring fatigue to players.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F0cd2cb55-a82d-4b98-8b3d-eaae99050b2d.jpg/size/" alt="0cd2cb55-a82d-4b98-8b3d-eaae99050b2d.jpg"></p>
<p>In the end, there were only a handful of successful games on Kinect. The relatively complete “Star Wars” can be said to be a work that was more recognized and accepted by players in terms of motion-sensing game operation at that time, and the game was no longer just a casual game. When the characters in the game make corresponding actions according to the player’s gestures, the player’s “scream level” is still very high.</p>
<p>The biggest difference from the Wii motion controller is that players can use their hands and feet together in the game and make more coherent and complex actions, such as kicking and jumping in fighting games. When designing these interactive actions, Microsoft also tried to minimize the physical exertion of players. For example, when controlling the character to move left and right, players do not need to actually make these actions, just slightly shifting their body can trigger it.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F088086ce-66aa-4196-a05b-c47bd7343e57.jpg/size/" alt="088086ce-66aa-4196-a05b-c47bd7343e57.jpg"></p>
<p>However, the biggest problem with motion interaction is also revealed, misoperation. This is also another drawback of gesture interaction. Users are no longer just operating in a single dimension, but in three-dimensional space, which makes the trigger conditions of actions themselves difficult to define and control. For example, now there is an operation called waving your arm. It seems like a simple command, but the actions that everyone may make are different; the distance, amplitude, and direction of the wave are uncontrollable. This makes the trigger conditions for gesture interaction very difficult to define, and the probability of misoperation and operation failure is very high.</p>
<h2 id="Players’-Coolness"><a href="#Players’-Coolness" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Coolness"></a>Players’ Coolness</h2><p>Therefore, after experiencing the wave of motion-sensing games in 2010, the still immature motion-sensing interaction gradually faded out of the vision of the console platform. The lack of motion-sensing game content, insufficient hardware capabilities, and the difficulty of sustaining interactive methods. When players have a taste, they are more disappointed.</p>
<h2 id="New-Exploration"><a href="#New-Exploration" class="headerlink" title="New Exploration"></a>New Exploration</h2><p>Of course, motion-sensing games were not abandoned after failure. On the contrary, it has always been the direction of future games. In the process of the gradual development of VR and AR, motion-sensing interaction has become a part of virtual reality technology, and even the only feasible form of interaction. On mobile games, motion-sensing technology will also be used as an auxiliary operation method, such as the “gravity-sensing aiming method” in <em>PUBG Mobile</em>. But motion-sensing games, as an independent and complete game system, are rarely mentioned again, until Nintendo brings its “big baby” again.</p>
<h3 id="Nintendo-Labo"><a href="#Nintendo-Labo" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Labo"></a>Nintendo Labo</h3><p>Nintendo has never given up on the exploration of motion-sensing games from beginning to end. At the beginning of the design of the new generation of mobile handheld Switch, the controller was designed as a motion-sensing controller, and an IR infrared camera was added. Although I don’t know the purpose of adding the infrared camera, in the later design of Labo, this camera can be said to provide new ideas for the entire motion-sensing game interaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Fb172612d-8487-4b5d-bd4e-453e15a2973e.jpg/size/" alt="b172612d-8487-4b5d-bd4e-453e15a2973e.jpg"></p>
<p>The Labo project is Nintendo’s another exploration of motion-sensing games. Although in the first version of Labo, the switch becomes a toy like a fishing rod, piano, etc., it seems that it cannot well reflect the concept of “motion-sensing games” (still lacking the necessary gameplay), but its working principle and design ideas have provided an interactive prototype for future series of products.</p>
<h3 id="Separate-Controllers-Work-Simultaneously"><a href="#Separate-Controllers-Work-Simultaneously" class="headerlink" title="Separate Controllers Work Simultaneously"></a>Separate Controllers Work Simultaneously</h3><p>The Switch has two independent game controllers. This design is to make it easier for you to operate with friends in multiplayer games. At the beginning of the design of Labo, the producer always hoped to make a breakthrough in operation, so that this set of interactions can give full play to the advantages of the Switch controller, instead of making settings similar to others.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have been thinking about the controller and its special features, and finally I realized that it is the sensor-there are sensors in both the left and right controllers. If we create while connecting two Joy-Cons at the same time, we can use the differences between their sensors to do various new things… This is the real beginning. ——Mr. Sakaguchi (Head of Labo Software)</p>
<p>This design concept runs through the entire Labo product, and also provides new possibilities for the design of motion-sensing devices. Usually, what people understand most easily is that two controllers are used separately, such as my right hand holding a “sword” and my left hand holding a “shield”, then they are a superimposed control relationship. But in the design of the “fishing rod”, by fixing the right Joy-Con to the handle of the fishing rod, and then fixing the left Joy-Con to the fishing reel, you can use the position of the handle to measure the rotation of the fishing reel. Or to put it another way, if you only use the Joy-Con on the left, you will not be able to distinguish the movement of the fishing rod from the movement of the fishing reel. However, if you then add the Joy-Con on the right and compare its sensor with the difference of the Joy-Con on the left, you can make it work normally. As they delved deeper into all the experiments, the Labo production team began to regard Joy-Con as a sensor bundle, which gave them a real opportunity to release the consideration of various possibilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F2bc906db-f384-4abd-897f-df7ab2b93583.jpg/size/" alt="2bc906db-f384-4abd-897f-df7ab2b93583.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="Infrared-Camera-in-a-Cardboard-Box"><a href="#Infrared-Camera-in-a-Cardboard-Box" class="headerlink" title="Infrared Camera in a Cardboard Box"></a>Infrared Camera in a Cardboard Box</h3><p>In addition to the collaborative work of the controller bundle, another interesting mechanism is the use of an infrared camera. In traditional motion-sensing games, infrared depth sensors are placed in space to capture the player’s movements. In the Labo project, this infrared camera is used in a closed box. The infrared camera no longer directly captures the player’s motion information, but captures the position and size changes of the “reflective strip” in the box due to the player’s operation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2Fca37f170-4d34-44b6-b491-e30a9c83c1b0.jpg/size/" alt="ca37f170-4d34-44b6-b491-e30a9c83c1b0.jpg"></p>
<p>The picture above shows the design of the control device of the Labo No. 2 project robot. Players only need to insert the controller with the infrared camera into the hole in the box, and the camera will capture the position changes of the four reflective strips in the box in the game. And the player ties the four ropes linked to the reflective strip to the feet and hands, and can control the movement of the robot in the game by pulling the rope during exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201022%2F9c2b9bff-0b9b-48e2-aabd-498af9367004.jpg/size/" alt="9c2b9bff-0b9b-48e2-aabd-498af9367004.jpg"></p>
<p>This design brings many benefits. First, the amount of input information has increased, and it is no longer limited by hardware. The camera can collect multiple different position variables at the same time, and each variable corresponds to the player’s different gesture operations. Second, gesture input information becomes controllable; as mentioned above, the problem with interactions like Kinect that rely on motion capture is that players can make many unpredictable gestures, which can lead to misoperation and operation failure; while the movement of the “reflective strip” in the box is very fixed and controllable, they can correspond very well to the fixed actions in the game, and are accurate enough. For example, in this robot game, there are only a few attack actions. Capturing the player’s extra actions (such as twisting the waist) will only increase the complexity of the trigger of the motion interaction. Converting the player’s effective actions into predictable input parameters and inputting them into the game control is the core highlight of Labo’s motion-sensing design.</p>
<p>Of course, the use of this camera also brings another benefit, which is to reduce electronification. In addition to the original Joy-con controller, the Labo controller no longer has other electronic sensors, which solves the cost problem well. This problem may be a难题 that has existed since the beginning of motion-sensing games, high cost and low versatility.</p>
<h3 id="Labo-Series-and-Ring-Fit-Adventure"><a href="#Labo-Series-and-Ring-Fit-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Labo Series and Ring Fit Adventure"></a>Labo Series and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></h3><p>The Labo series launched the third game of the series in the first half of this year. The biggest difference between the third part and the previous ones is that it is no longer a series of mini-games. This time it is a complete exploration game, and even added online and battle parts. At the same time, Labo’s motion-sensing design concept is also constantly exerting its advantages. The controller is like the key switch of the device, and players can quickly and freely switch between various motion-sensing devices; motion-sensing operations are no longer vague and inefficient, and players can very accurately control complex motion-sensing devices, and experience the fun of control at the same time.</p>

<p>Not only that, the recently released “<em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>“ has once again made motion-sensing games a big hit. The biggest change of “<em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>“ compared with traditional fitness games is the leap in its gameplay. Secondly, the interaction mode based on the fitness ring is also very interesting.</p>
<p>It seems that the second spring of motion-sensing games is coming.</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue"><a href="#Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2><p>Nintendo has always been a game company that I admire very much. When motion-sensing games are not favored by the market, they still insist on constantly trying motion-sensing creative elements in their own games. From Nintendo games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Mario Party</em>, we can experience those wonderful experiences that have disappeared. Of course, until now we dare not say whether motion-sensing games can really try to impact hardcore games, but it must be able to become the interactive mode of future immersive games. At the same time, we have also seen a clearer direction from the development of motion-sensing technology.</p>
<p>Motion-sensing games do not necessarily have to completely simulate human movement. Players can interact with the game through motion-sensing devices to complete more exciting operations. This is the goal of motion sensing. In addition, motion-sensing devices also need to have stronger scalability and be able to freely adapt to input information in different operating modes. Just like the hardware product structure designed by engineers in the past, the motion-sensing device is the “button” that guides the player to make interactive actions. In future motion-sensing games, whether this device is virtual or concrete, it will carry a more real and rich experience for players.</p>
<p>A new beginning for motion-sensing games, a new world.</p>

<p>A game community is an online community composed of a group of game-loving netizens who specifically discuss and interact with games and game-related content.</p>
<p>Similar to other online communities, game communities have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certain entry barriers:</strong> These game communities must be entered by players who have a certain understanding of the game and can accept specific interaction rules.</li>
<li><strong>Specific communication and interaction spaces:</strong> Unlike more comprehensive content platforms (such as Weibo and Tieba), these communities often have their own dedicated apps, forums, and other interaction spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Content production around specific themes:</strong> Game communities focus on games for content production and operation, and the content produced is highly specialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>For us game practitioners, the game community is a very important platform for game marketing and interaction with players, because it allows us to better understand the game content preferences and game experience ideas of higher-level players. In this series of studies, we will introduce several typical game communities and their differentiated user characteristics and service positioning characteristics.</p>
<p>First up: TapTap</p>
<p>TapTap is a game community and third-party game download application platform developed by ewan (Shanghai) Network Technology Co., Ltd. On this platform, users can easily discover games, purchase and install games, and can also publish game reviews and discuss games with other enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As a game community, TapTap has the following service features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clear access mechanism:</strong> By setting up an “Etiquette Exam” in the user registration process, TapTap clarifies a relatively clear user access mechanism - users need to understand and recognize certain community interaction rules, and master basic game common sense to enter the TapTap community.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F979984f7-6aa6-4041-b38d-28d73078cefb.jpg/size/" alt="TapTap Etiquette Exam Page"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emphasis on shaping the interactive atmosphere of community members:</strong> By setting up interactive review replies, likes, and thematic forums, TapTap emphasizes creating an atmosphere of communication between players and players, and between players and game developers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F8330793a-df1c-4640-a8ae-53d806c281c7.jpg/size/" alt="Game developers reply to player reviews on TapTap"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Featuring high-quality game review content:</strong> Compared with game reviews in mobile app stores, game reviews on TapTap are generally of higher quality. Even if players give a low-star rating, they will give detailed reasons. These quality-guaranteed game reviews provide game developers with many suggestions for game optimization.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Fa8cbd132-0d01-489e-95d9-674ac72edb16.jpg/size/" alt="Screenshots of the review pages of PUBG Mobile in Wandoujia and TapTap. It can be seen that the reviews given by TapTap are detailed and there are fewer emotional replies."></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are the service features of TapTap as a professional game community.</p>
<p><strong>User Portrait</strong></p>
<p>Some people may ask, what are the characteristics of TapTap users? Do they have preferences for specific game categories and gameplay? By querying Baidu Index (time window: September 29, 2019 - October 28, 2019) and referring to other industry reports, we have obtained the following TapTap user portrait information:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>User gender distribution:</strong> TapTap has significantly more male users than female users.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Ff356340b-3414-451c-96ad-563bc76d587e.jpg/size/" alt="User gender distribution"></p>
<p>(2) <strong>User age distribution:</strong> Among TapTap users, users aged 24 and below account for 78.6%.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F22e0c0c6-a271-4cbb-9452-ccbfaaff7f52.jpg/size/" alt="User age distribution"></p>
<p>(3) <strong>User geographical distribution:</strong> Mostly distributed in coastal areas, but also covers some central and western provinces. If calculated according to the frequency of users searching for TapTap in various places, users in coastal provinces (such as Guangdong and Jiangsu) rank higher, but it can be seen that the search popularity of TapTap is higher in some central and western provinces (such as Henan, Sichuan, Hubei, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F7d1353df-27d7-478d-b29d-acaa1b59d9d6.jpg/size/" alt="User geographical distribution"></p>
<p>(4) <strong>User game preference:</strong> Relatively prefer independent games. Compared with popular game categories, users have higher evaluations of games with innovative gameplay. Based on a study of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list in the first half of 2019 conducted by 36Kr website in May 2019, we can find that most of the games with good reputation (rating 8.0 and above) on TapTap are independent games, including independent studios and independent projects released by major manufacturers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Fa0ff8bf7-52c9-4f7c-9e7a-c14757375a74.jpg/size/" alt="TapTap&#39;s Top 12 Games by Reputation, from which it can be seen that most of them are produced by independent studios"></p>
<p>Based on this list, we can also find the following trends: popular categories in the mobile game market, such as MOBA, MMO, and battle royale, have been somewhat snubbed on the TapTap platform due to the large number of similar competing products and the convergence of gameplay. Games in categories such as puzzle, story, casual, and hardcore action are more likely to be praised by TapTap users because their audience is relatively small and there is more room for gameplay innovation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F8a915329-9625-4825-a48e-d18ea729bb2f.jpg/size/" alt="Category distribution of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list. It can be seen that casual puzzle, text story and other categories account for a relatively high proportion."></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F75c1b21a-cf87-4975-a0b7-72b06eaa3406.jpg/size/" alt="The above picture is a word cloud map based on the tags of the Top 50 games on the TapTap reputation list. It can be seen that tags such as single-player, casual, puzzle, and intellectual appear more frequently."></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>From the above analysis, we make the following summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>TapTap as a game community: has certain entry barriers, is highly specialized, and maintains a relatively neutral image among players and game manufacturers;</li>
<li>As a member of such a game community: young, with rich game experience, and relatively niche game preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>So do other game communities have similar user and service characteristics to TapTap?</p>

    <title>[UI Sharing] Three Basic Design Principles for Gesture Interaction in Mobile Games</title>
    <url>/2019/12/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20201029_28584_912724/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201029/28584_912724.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gesture interaction generally appears on the touch screens of various mobile devices. Mobile devices have become one of the important terminals for people to participate in entertainment games, and gesture interaction design for touch screens has become an important design topic in the field of game design.</p>
<p>How to design gesture interaction with higher usability? In practice, we have summarized three important design principles for gesture interaction.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gesture interaction needs to be simple and direct.</strong> Simple gesture operation design allows players of different ages to learn at a glance, thereby stimulating players’ game fun. For example, <em>Fruit Ninja (2010)</em> and <em>Angry Birds (2011)</em> can be completely controlled with just one finger throughout the entire game process.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F463923cb-f1b6-4ed7-ac37-725f04fce8c6.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;463923cb-f1b6-4ed7-ac37-725f04fce8c6.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F4e851406-173a-4060-b17f-334cb0917531.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;4e851406-173a-4060-b17f-334cb0917531.jpg"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gesture interaction needs to conform to common sense in life.</strong> The gesture design of the game should be as simple as possible and conform to the player’s habits in the same context in real life, and the metaphorical gestures should follow the universally recognized principles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interactive design of gestures in the <em>Florence</em> game fully reflects the respect for the cognition and experience gained by players in real life when designing gesture interactions, and uses them in gesture interaction design to reduce the cost of guiding players to learn interactive behaviors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F1f05538a-4226-48b8-baff-d8655a0e88a0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;1f05538a-4226-48b8-baff-d8655a0e88a0.jpg"></p>
<p>The method of turning off the alarm clock is to press the alarm clock; the method of brushing teeth is to drag the toothbrush left and right, up and down; liking and refreshing social software are the same as in daily life. In <em>Florence</em>, players can complete these interactive behaviors by instinct without any strong guidance or text introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Combined gesture interaction requires effective guidance</strong></p>
<p>Different from touch interaction, gestures such as dragging, pinching, long-pressing, or wiping belong to combined gesture interaction. Combined gesture interaction can often bring a more immersive interactive experience than a mouse or controller, that is closer to real life. For example, in the Apple system, operations such as switching screens and returning to the desktop use gestures with the touchpad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F8b2628ef-01ba-422f-85e9-df3e7aefde96.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;8b2628ef-01ba-422f-85e9-df3e7aefde96.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2F16c5330d-d39d-48d0-b9a5-0e30f2137cb0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;16c5330d-d39d-48d0-b9a5-0e30f2137cb0.jpg"></p>
<p>Players and users will feel that their fingers can control the screen as they wish. However, a user who has never been exposed to these interactive behaviors needs to read these gesture tutorials in detail to understand and use these interactive behaviors.</p>
<p>Combined gestures in games also require detailed teaching and guidance, otherwise some players will not be able to discover these interactions we provide to players, or after accidentally discovering these operations, they will not be able to use these interactive operations correctly again.</p>
<p><strong>Gesture interaction requires precise control</strong></p>
<p>Touch gestures are less accurate than a mouse in terms of operation. It is difficult for players to click very small buttons or drag controls to areas with pixel-level accuracy. Therefore, when designing gesture operations, we need to pay attention to the position, size, and number of buttons, as well as confirmation and undo operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201030%2Feb171910-a7ae-4397-a767-1b587d97d305.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;eb171910-a7ae-4397-a767-1b587d97d305.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>After completing an interaction design draft containing gesture interaction, we must verify its usability. The commonly used method is to implement a prototype based on the minimum viable solution of the design on a mobile terminal, and verify the rationality of the design through practice, research, and walkthroughs.</p>

    <title>Introduction to the KANO Model for Requirement Analysis</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20201030_28584_912958/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201030/28584_912958.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KANO is a method commonly used in the early stages of product development. I feel it is still worth taking some time to understand. Today, I will briefly introduce this method.</p>
<h2 id="Background-of-KANO"><a href="#Background-of-KANO" class="headerlink" title="Background of KANO"></a>Background of KANO</h2><p>Inspired by the two-factor theory of behavioral scientist Herzberg, Professor Noriaki Kano of the Tokyo University of Science, and his colleagues, first introduced the criteria of satisfaction and dissatisfaction into the field of quality management in the 1970s. They used a two-dimensional model to understand quality and proposed the famous Kano model. It is a tool for classifying and prioritizing user needs, based on analyzing the impact of user needs on user satisfaction, reflecting the non-linear relationship between product performance and user satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="Supplementary-Knowledge-Card-Two-Factor-Theory"><a href="#Supplementary-Knowledge-Card-Two-Factor-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Supplementary Knowledge Card: Two-Factor Theory"></a>Supplementary Knowledge Card: Two-Factor Theory</h3><p>Also known as the motivation-hygiene theory, it was proposed by American psychologist Herzberg in 1959. It mainly divides enterprises into two key factors, namely: motivating factors and hygiene factors. Motivating factors are factors that can make people feel satisfied and motivated (achievement, appreciation, challenge, responsibility…), and hygiene factors are factors that are prone to opinions and negative behaviors (salary, working conditions, company policies, management…).</p>
<h2 id="When-is-KANO-Suitable-for-Game-User-Research"><a href="#When-is-KANO-Suitable-for-Game-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="When is KANO Suitable for Game User Research?"></a>When is KANO Suitable for Game User Research?</h2><p>The product development cycle can be simply divided into these 5 periods. After the concept is confirmed and before the core gameplay MVP is completed, the product will go through a period of exploration. During this period, the product will sort out the main functions of the game and design the highlights and features of the game. At this time, some products will have a question: What do my users really want? Which functions&#x2F;features are more appealing to them?</p>
<p>When the product meets the first two conditions, the KANO requirement analysis can be used to help them solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>The product has a relatively clear target user (who I want to research).</li>
<li>The product has a preliminary design direction, brainstorming many special features or basic functional systems (what kind of game I want to make).</li>
<li>The product is a bit distant from their target users (non-essential condition: I don’t quite know what my users want).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two are actually easy to understand. Why do I mention the third? Because the main design team of some products is deeply rooted in the soil of their target users, and the information they know can represent the views of most of their users.</p>
<p>At this time, this kind of conceptual function research is not so significant for product reference. It is more necessary to focus on understanding the implementation standards of this feature, that is, how to express it and how it will better resonate with users. This is more common in some art material research, or combat method research.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction-to-the-KANO-Model"><a href="#Introduction-to-the-KANO-Model" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to the KANO Model"></a>Introduction to the KANO Model</h2><p>KANO divides needs into 5 types through the user’s attitude towards two situations – “having this function” and “not having this function”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attractive Needs:</strong> Needs that surprise users. If this need is not provided, it will not reduce user satisfaction. Once the attractive need is provided, user satisfaction will increase significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Needs (One-Dimensional Needs):</strong> If this function is provided, customer satisfaction increases. If this function is not provided, customer satisfaction will decrease.</li>
<li><strong>Must-be Needs (Basic Needs):</strong> These are the basic requirements of the product. If this need is not met, user satisfaction will decrease significantly. However, no matter how much the must-be needs are improved, customer satisfaction will have an upper limit.</li>
<li><strong>Indifferent Needs:</strong> Whether this function is provided or not, user satisfaction will not change. Users do not care whether this function exists or not. This kind of thankless need should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Needs:</strong> Users do not have this need at all. After providing it, user satisfaction will decrease. Improvement can greatly reduce dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>One important function of KANO is to help products prioritize players’ needs:</p>
<p>KANO’s ranking of requirements: Must-be &gt; Expected &gt; Attractive &gt; Indifferent</p>
<p>Games are not a very functional product. Users are unlikely to choose you because your basic functions are good, “for example, your game is particularly smooth”. They are more likely to choose you because of some differentiated features. In this case, letting the product know which content can be differentiated will be particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="Use-of-the-KANO-Questionnaire"><a href="#Use-of-the-KANO-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Use of the KANO Questionnaire"></a>Use of the KANO Questionnaire</h2><p>The original KANO questionnaire is mainly divided into two parts, requiring players to express their attitude from “very positive - neutral - very negative”.</p>
<p>KANO’s intention is to summarize the significance of the need for a single user by classifying the user’s attitude.</p>
<p>Note: The initial score is that one sample has a need classification for one function.</p>
<p>(A-Attractive needs, O-Expected needs, M-Must-be needs, Q-Questionable, R-Reverse needs, I-Indifferent needs)</p>
<p>The corresponding attractive, expected, must-be, reverse, and indifferent here are those that appeared in the previous quadrant diagram, so I won’t repeat them. What you need to pay attention to is your Q. If a need appears as Q, it is likely that there is a problem with this sample data, it may be an input error, or it may be a random fill-in. You need to consider deleting all the results of the sample. If there are many Qs, you should carefully review the question stem to see if there is an error in your question stem.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone will find that the results obtained by using KANO are based on the summary of the attitude of a single sample. Because each sample may have a different attitude towards the same function, coefficients&#x2F;algorithms need to be introduced for comprehensive evaluation.</p>
<p>In the Better and Worse system, R and Q are not included, so reverse needs need to be counted separately.</p>
<p>PS: When a need is rated as a reverse need a lot, this need needs to be excluded.</p>
<p>PPS: Under normal circumstances, reverse needs in games rarely appear. If they do appear, you need to pay attention to whether there is a problem with the description of the need.</p>
<p>Through score conversion, you will finally get a scatter plot.</p>
<p>No matter which method you use, you will eventually get a scatter plot. The KANO model does not give a fixed quadrant division standard. You need to set a dividing line to help you classify needs. This indicator line is the horizontal and vertical axes of the quadrant diagram.</p>
<p>Here are two division methods that I have used or seen:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Divide according to the distribution of current demand scores</strong></p>
<p>This method has a stronger directivity for the ranking of needs (internal relative value); the directivity for the category attribution of need classification will be weaker.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Divide according to the meaning of the attitude represented by the score</strong></p>
<p>① 0.5 Better&#x2F;Worse coefficient – at least 50% of people think it would be better to have this&#x2F;would be disappointed not to have this</p>
<p>② Average attitude score of 2 points – it would be okay to have this function (hope to have it, but it won’t add points)&#x2F;reluctantly accept not having this function (hope to have it, but not having it won’t deduct points)</p>
<p>This method has a clearer attitude towards the category attribution of need classification; but it is relatively strict. In non-essential products such as game products, because players have large differences in the fun they pursue in the game, the attitude will not be very concentrated. This method is still applicable when the differences within the group are small during the research, such as all of them being the same type of players (such as strong PVP players in a strong operation MMO).</p>
<h2 id="Practical-Operation-Process-of-KANO-Questionnaire"><a href="#Practical-Operation-Process-of-KANO-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Practical Operation Process of KANO Questionnaire"></a>Practical Operation Process of KANO Questionnaire</h2><p>As a questionnaire, KANO can be used for research alone, or it can be combined with in-depth interviews or focus groups. There are various ways to use it. The questionnaire itself has roughly these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requirement pool collection &amp; item confirmation.</li>
<li>Questionnaire design (determining question items and options, and confirming the presentation format)</li>
<li>Questionnaire testing</li>
<li>Data collection (distribution + recycling)</li>
<li>Data cleaning (exclusion of invalid questionnaires)</li>
<li>Data analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several points that must be paid attention to in actual operation:</p>
<p>① As a questionnaire, the text carries most of the product’s intentions, so it is necessary to ensure that the question stem can be understood by users, and the content understood by users is consistent with the original intention of the product. It is recommended to do at least two rounds of text material testing (testing to find problems to modification is one round).</p>
<p>② The filling method of KANO is relatively complicated, and users with different abilities have different understanding abilities. It is best to administer the test in person (the tester needs to understand the original intention of the product for the description of each item in the document), which can better explain the logic of the questionnaire and provide immediate interpretation help.</p>
<p>This article ends here. Thank you for reading. I hope it can be helpful to everyone in using the KANO tool~</p>

    <title>Seven Recommendations for Creating Game UI</title>
    <url>/2019/12/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20201102_28584_913356/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201102/28584_913356.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game user interface is the space where the user interacts with the machine.</p>
<p>The game user interface not only includes the GUI (graphical user interface) on the screen, but also includes touch controls on mobile phones, for instance - all controls that interact with the user in one or more ways. This is what we call interaction.</p>
<p>In the following text, we will discuss a lot about the graphical interface, but please keep in mind that it is part of a larger scope: the GUI is always affected by the interaction method, and it also affects the interaction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-Designing-UI-is-About-Space-and-White-Space"><a href="#1-Designing-UI-is-About-Space-and-White-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Designing UI is About Space and White Space"></a>1. Designing UI is About Space and White Space</h2><p>Controls bring structure, hierarchy, and clarity, giving the GUI a sense of breathing room.</p>
<p>The main task of design is to deal with screen space: when and where should players master what information on the interface?</p>
<p>We can use two design methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully add the information you think is necessary on the interface until the interface is almost arranged.</li>
<li>Put all the information you think may need to be placed on the interface, and then remove some information you think is not important until the white space of the interface reaches a comfortable value, and leaves enough important information for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Space is not just the blank part between two main elements, but also includes the white space between letters, the pixels between images… When it comes to space, everything is important.</p>
<p>Which of the above two design methods is used depends on the project, intention, and designer. When designing, keep an open mind and try new methods. (One note: Due to the prevalence of minimalism, many UI designers are now starting to work in this direction, but over-focusing on minimalism may lead to a lack of important game information. Minimalism is not as easy as it seems. In many cases, planners want to express a lot of information. Minimalism is not about deleting information, but about presenting more information with less content, which increases the requirements for designers.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-Art-Style-and-Immersion"><a href="#2-Art-Style-and-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="2. Art Style and Immersion"></a>2. Art Style and Immersion</h2><p>The UI style being consistent with the game’s art direction will greatly enhance the overall immersion of the game. However, if you don’t have enough resources or ability, please don’t try to make a very special GUI to fit your art style. Designing a mature flat UI is better than a strange “I think this GUI is very suitable for my art style”.</p>
<p>Flat design is like “black”, it is easy to get results.</p>

<h2 id="3-Form-Follows-Function"><a href="#3-Form-Follows-Function" class="headerlink" title="3. Form Follows Function"></a>3. Form Follows Function</h2><p>When designing, consider using color, shape, and other attributes to illustrate how to use elements. This design method is called “affordances”.</p>
<p><strong>1. Shape</strong></p>
<p>The shape, color, and size of UI elements really illustrate their position and purpose here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F0c7cf2b5-4bc9-4aa7-b592-14771b5a2cc9.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;0c7cf2b5-4bc9-4aa7-b592-14771b5a2cc9.jpg"></p>
<p>As shown above, the shadow of each button provides a lot of information to the user. The light comes from the top, and the shadow will cause depth and possible movement when pressed.</p>
<p><strong>2. Size</strong></p>
<p>We can use “Fitts’s Law” to scale the button to a degree proportional to its use.</p>
<p>But making information&#x2F;space huge is not the solution to everything. Too large is often ugly and feels inappropriate. Aesthetics are also very important. The more beautiful the appearance, the more it can bring players satisfaction and pleasure. We believe that this will also affect key performance indicators.</p>
<p>The proportion between elements is also very important. The following figure is a design sketch of a binary options game. The proportion of its interface elements is very poorly designed, which is why its bottom button appears completely unsuitable for the interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2Fee3a6501-d233-4df2-b528-3f517318fca8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;ee3a6501-d233-4df2-b528-3f517318fca8.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>3. Color</strong></p>
<p>Compared to shape, color should better illustrate “what this space should do”. You can ask yourself, what do you want to convey to the player with this control, is it good or bad? This should influence your color choices.</p>
<p>Color also depends on culture. For example, in foreign countries, red will be used for health-related content, as well as negative, warning, and feedback. But in China, red is mostly a very positive color, which means good luck and joy.</p>
<p>When designing international games, you need to consider this, but we don’t need to be too careful. In a globalized environment, the meaning of color is not so clearly demarcated. For example, many games in China now also use red as a warning, such as a strong red feedback when the health is low. The influence of culture on color will only slightly affect some special feedback and UI elements.</p>
<p>In addition, when designing, we should try to design in black and white as much as possible. This is a good technique to help you quickly obtain prominent information and identify key issues. In addition, about 10% of people can only see a limited range of colors, so we should also pay attention to how to match colors so that these people will not be confused because they cannot see the color difference.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-Consistency"><a href="#4-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="4. Consistency"></a>4. Consistency</h2><p>The UI needs to be consistent with player operating behavior, and so do color and space.</p>
<p>This is a rule of thumb to help you easily know how many colors should be in the UI palette:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F2c8d9d3e-1516-41bc-90a8-0a5b74d09e05.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;2c8d9d3e-1516-41bc-90a8-0a5b74d09e05.jpg"></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a dark&#x2F;black and a slightly lighter color</li>
<li>Choose a bright&#x2F;white and a slightly darker color</li>
<li>Choose a red color as a warning and negative feedback color</li>
<li>Choose green as the verification and positive feedback color</li>
<li>You can choose another “key” color as the color of all other content. This color needs to be neutral and not particularly positive or negative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, you can choose more or fewer colors according to the specific situation of the project. Choosing the right color is another matter. Trying to make the colors match well is also important.</p>
<p>If you need to use the same color to make changes, I suggest you only change the “saturation” and “brightness” of the color, as shown above.</p>
<p>We also need to pay attention to the number of fonts and font sizes used. We will only add fonts or sizes when it makes sense, and combine them with the creation of interactive levels for a purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-Usability-Efficiency-and-Satisfaction"><a href="#5-Usability-Efficiency-and-Satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="5. Usability, Efficiency and Satisfaction"></a>5. Usability, Efficiency and Satisfaction</h2><p>The player is never wrong.</p>
<p>Repeat, the player is never wrong.</p>
<p>If someone misuses your design, it means that your design is misleading, and the problem lies with the designer. Users don’t really misuse it, they just use it according to what they think is the correct understanding.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t meet everyone’s needs, so we need to focus more on the core audience. Sometimes making a tutorial can greatly help us improve usability.</p>
<p>In general, this is a very ideal point of view, and we should always strive for an experience without explanation and friction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-The-Art-of-Animation"><a href="#6-The-Art-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="6. The Art of Animation"></a>6. The Art of Animation</h2><p>Movement should be natural.</p>
<p>Animation is a bonus item for the interface, which can make our design change from “very good” to “wow”. Slight animation transitions can convey a lot of information and feelings in a very intuitive way.</p>
<p>It can also help the player’s brain transition from one state to another, and make the whole experience smoother. We believe that the best animation is one that players are not aware of, but is still useful to them.</p>
<p>Just like level design: the best designers are invisible, and players are unaware.</p>
<p>Sadly, this makes it very difficult to test animations and truly define whether they are correct.</p>
<p>The movement should last between 200 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds. Any animation over 500 milliseconds may be felt to be too slow.</p>
<p>Below we use Robert Penner’s easing animation example to explore the real skills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F7b4781e6-8c16-4a32-8679-886617bc1ed0.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;7b4781e6-8c16-4a32-8679-886617bc1ed0.jpg"></p>
<p>Most of the time, we will want to use cubic motion to make the animation feel natural. Depending on the game world, we will generally use “elastic”, “bounce” or “back” to get a cartoon-like feeling.</p>
<p>(Another indication about motion: elements moving within the screen range should accelerate and decelerate, elements moving out of the screen should only accelerate, and elements entering the screen should only decelerate.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-Frictionless"><a href="#7-Frictionless" class="headerlink" title="7. Frictionless"></a>7. Frictionless</h2><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201102%2F081c62df-88c3-49bb-a315-01297fb8fe4a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201102&#x2F;081c62df-88c3-49bb-a315-01297fb8fe4a.jpg"></p>
<p>Google’s undo button, designed with user fault tolerance in mind.</p>
<p>All of the above can be summarized in one word: frictionless - the user interface should provide players with the information they need at the right time and allow them to control it in the way they like.</p>
<p>This is largely ideological, but perhaps an AI-driven future can better achieve this. For now, our design goal is “fewer errors”. We can’t make a completely correct UI interface, which contains too many factors.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, UI design will be designed according to its purpose and according to what the player’s brain is familiar with.</p>

The differences between individuals are not as big as we think. For example, core usability problems can often be tested by just a few people. We invite more users to the lab, and we can indeed find more problems. But the more problems found are generally minor problems. The core problems will be repeatedly mentioned by different users.</p>

Second, every user who participates in the test needs to sign a confidentiality agreement. We have a very standardized confidentiality agreement. In addition, user researchers will actively screen some users to avoid testing industry practitioners or media personnel. Finally, when user researchers deal with confidential projects, they will not handle them publicly, but by authorized members.</p>

    <title>Python Learning Guide - Iterables, Iterators, and Generators</title>

<p>Generators and iterators are unavoidable topics in Python learning, and they are also frequently used in actual coding.</p>
<p>First, let’s clarify the relationship between several key concepts:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Iterable</th>
<th align="left">Iterator</th>
<th align="left">Generator</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">Object implementing <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__next__</code></td>
<td align="left">A special type of iterator</td>

<td align="left">Can traverse elements using <code>next()</code> or <code>for</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">Implemented using generator functions or expressions</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
<p><strong>Iterable (iterable)</strong></p>
<p>Objects that can be directly used in a <code>for</code> loop are collectively called iterables (Iterable), or in other words, objects that implement the <code>__iter__</code> method. An iterator must be an iterable.</p>
<p>You can directly use the <code>isinstance()</code> function to check if an object is iterable.</p>
<p>Lists, tuples, etc., are all iterables. You can call the <code>__iter__</code> method of the iterable using the <code>iter()</code> function to obtain the corresponding iterator, and then use <code>next()</code> to iterate through it.</p>
<p><strong>List Comprehension (List Comprehension)</strong></p>
<p>List comprehension, or list generation, are different terms for the same concept. Essentially, they create a new list directly using <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>It’s important to distinguish between generator expressions and list comprehensions:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># List comprehension</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">list</span> = [item <span class="keyword">for</span> item <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="built_in">range</span>(<span class="number">10</span>)]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="built_in">list</span>)  <span class="comment"># Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="built_in">next</span>(<span class="built_in">list</span>))  <span class="comment"># Output: TypeError: &#x27;list&#x27; object is not an iterator</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">list</span> = [item <span class="keyword">for</span> item <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="built_in">range</span>(<span class="number">10</span>)]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="built_in">list</span>)  <span class="comment"># Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</span></span><br><span class="line">list1 = <span class="built_in">iter</span>(<span class="built_in">list</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="built_in">next</span>(list1))  <span class="comment"># Output: 0</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>List comprehensions also leverage Python’s iteration features, using <code>[]</code> to enclose a <code>for</code> clause.  They are primarily used for creating new lists, and are efficient and highly readable.  However, the returned data is entirely stored in memory.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship between Generators and Iterators:</strong></p>
<p>An iterator is a broader concept. A generator is a special type of iterator, but the reverse is not true.</p>
<p>Generators and iterators are similar in that they can both be used to access elements through a <code>for</code> loop and are both iterables.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator (iterator)</strong></p>
<p>An iterator is an object that implements both the <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> methods, capable of remembering the position of each traversal.</p>
<p>Iterators can be traversed using the <code>next()</code> method or a general <code>for</code> loop.  Iteration terminates by raising a <code>StopIteration</code> exception, which is also part of the iterator protocol.</p>

A generator can be a function containing the `yield` keyword, used in a `for` loop to generate a series of elements.

A generator can be the iterator object returned by a generator function.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">3.  A generator can be an expression that returns an iterator, using `()` to enclose a `for` clause, and optionally an `if` clause.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">Implementing a generator with a generator function:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">```python</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string"># Generator function, using the yield keyword</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">def generate_squares(N):</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    for i in range(N):</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">        yield i ** 2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">for item in generate_squares(5):</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    print(item,)  # Output is a series of numbers, each on a new line.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string"></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">Implementing a generator with a generator expression:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">python</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string"># Generator expression</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">g = (item for item in range(10))</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">print(g)  # Output: &lt;generator object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x0095BBF0&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">print(next(g))  # Output: 0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">print(next(g))  # Output: 1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Generators are characterized by lazy evaluation, calculating only when used, saving memory space. This is why <code>print(g)</code> in the example above doesn’t directly return the values, but instead returns a <code>generator object</code>.</p>
<p>Generators are single-iterator objects.  They produce only one value at a time, and each value can only be retrieved once.  Attempting to retrieve a value more than once will raise an error.</p>
<p><strong>Design of Iterables and Iterators:</strong></p>
<p>Finally, let’s address why we need iterables if iterators alone can fulfill our needs for traversing collection elements. Iterables typically also need to call the <code>__iter__</code> method to return an iterator for element traversal.</p>
<p>The book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” describes the design of the iterator pattern very well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the contents of an aggregate object without exposing its internal representation.</li>
<li>Support multiple traversals of an aggregate object.</li>
<li>Provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>If an object implements the <code>__iter__</code> method, it is an iterable. If an iterable implements the <code>__next__</code> method, which provides iteration traversal, it is an iterator. Calling the <code>__iter__</code> method returns an instance of the current object’s iterator class.</p>

    <title>Game Product Design: Player&#39;s Sense of Achievement</title>
    <url>/2019/12/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20201103_28584_913633/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201103/28584_913633.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Game producer Jenova Chen mentioned in his GDC talk about <em>Journey</em> (the designer of <em>Journey</em> sharing the team’s process of developing the game) that movies are already very mature and have precipitated different emotions, but the sense of achievement provided by most games cannot be provided by movies. Only the feedback obtained after one’s own efforts will give you a sense of achievement. This feeling can only be achieved through interactive experience. Perhaps because of this, this is also the most explored emotional direction in games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2F034f4c58-4bda-4509-8439-0f70da5c3bf9.jpg/size/" alt="Journey"></p>
<h2 id="Goals-in-Games"><a href="#Goals-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Goals in Games"></a>Goals in Games</h2><p>The charm of games, or the reason why they attract players and make them unable to stop, is precisely this. There are many goals in games that can satisfy people with different needs. Those who like collecting have full collection achievements, and those who like cultivation have various cultivation elements. In the game, players are always in a state of striving to achieve a certain goal, from completing single-game goals to phased milestone goals, and then to completing the ultimate goal. In this way, players feel that they have something to do, and experience a strong sense of participation and immersion in the process of doing things. When the goal is completed, there is also a strong sense of achievement.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2F15e52019-7bd6-4791-be91-dd5feda53103.jpg/size/" alt="Game Goals"></p>
<p>During design, player goals and design goals can be achieved simultaneously. “Visible progress” in the game is a very important advantage compared to various learning and exercise goals in real life. Many times in real life, when we learn a piece of knowledge or a skill, we practice for a long time without seeing “visible” progress, and we even don’t know whether we are practicing in the right direction. But in the game, we can clearly see the “experience increase”, “current progress”, etc., so that we have more motivation to continue.</p>
<h2 id="User’s-Sense-of-Control"><a href="#User’s-Sense-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="User’s Sense of Control"></a>User’s Sense of Control</h2><p>Sense of control is a person’s belief in their ability to control the surrounding environment. In the context of user experience design, sense of control can be used to describe the user’s confidence or frustration in using the product, and can also be used to describe the usability of the product itself. If users have a high sense of control when using the product or completing tasks, their attitude will be more positive, they will be more willing to accept setbacks and make mistakes, and they will also have a greater sense of security. In the process of experience design, we should ensure the user’s sense of control to enhance the user’s participation and willingness to explore.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2Fcf4bb8be-15f8-4703-9ec0-0087fe3d3ded.jpg/size/" alt="Sense of Control"></p>
<p>Especially for racing games, you can experience a higher need for control - bypassing different corners, flying out, and most importantly, grasping your own direction, otherwise you will lose control. The sense of control and challenge it possesses is very fascinating. This fascination is very easy to enter a “flow state”, which is also the effect that game designers hope to achieve.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback-and-Satisfaction"><a href="#Feedback-and-Satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="Feedback and Satisfaction"></a>Feedback and Satisfaction</h2><p>When skills are improved or levels are raised, there is a certain sense of proficiency. At this time, players should have a feeling of encouragement. This kind of positive and rapid encouragement helps users form a positive attitude towards the use process. For example, when you are playing a game, the initial operational requirements make you feel a little uncomfortable, such as selecting minions and switching between heroes’ attacks. But when your level improves, you can easily control your operations, and the operation effects are fed back in real time, quickly informing you of the results, to obtain great satisfaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2Fc4356b53-5f6a-47ac-adba-d250510c1949.jpg/size/" alt="Feedback"></p>
<p>The game feedback system clearly tells players the current situation and shows how far they are from achieving their goals. It is reflected in the form of points, levels, scores, progress bars, equipment backpacks, etc. The feedback system is the most basic and simplest form. For players, real-time feedback is a promise: the goal can definitely be achieved, which gives people confidence to continue playing.</p>
<h2 id="Coda"><a href="#Coda" class="headerlink" title="Coda"></a>Coda</h2><p>Games make players feel happy. We must constantly create happy things in the game to satisfy players’ corrections to real-life dissatisfaction. Players will have a good impression of such games, and their psychology will be satisfied.</p>

    <title>2019 TGA Game of the Year &quot;Sekiro&quot; and Its Players</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20201106/28584_914219.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p><em>What is dark? But an excuse for light.</em></p>
<p><em>What is rot? But an excuse for ripe.</em></p>
<p><em>Without darkness, would stars be admired?</em></p>
<p><em>Without a burn, would man discover fire?</em></p>
<p><em>Without shadow, could you find the light source?</em></p>
<p><em>Without hunger could you serve a main course?</em></p>
<p><em>What is dark? But an excuse for light.</em></p>
<p><em>What is death? But an excuse for life.</em></p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Souls-like games are known for their “difficulty.” To beat a Souls-like game, players often have to die hundreds or even thousands of times. What kind of magic can make players enjoy “death,” a form of negative feedback? Defeated again and again, and picking up the controller again and again to embark on the journey. This poem can be said to be the best annotation of the Souls-like series.</p>
<p><em>When a general goes to war, he should consider it an honor to die in battle, and a disgrace to survive.</em></p>
<p>— <em>The Art of War by Wu Qi, Chapter 4: On Generals</em></p>
<p>Although the Souls series has gradually been recognized and received attention among players, it has never been able to win the “Oscar” of the game industry - the TGA Game of the Year. In 2014, <em>Dark Souls 3</em> failed to win the TGA in a year with few major game releases. In 2015, <em>Bloodborne</em> also lost to another masterpiece, <em>The Witcher 3</em>. In 2019, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> embarked on the journey again, and this time Hidetaka Miyazaki finally got his wish.</p>
<p>On December 13, 2019, Beijing time, Miyazaki finally ascended to the altar and won the TGA Game of the Year award. This process, just like the games he created, never gives up, never surrenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20201224%2F1fa88189-60e7-4f32-8ba8-062939dfa8f1.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20201224&#x2F;1fa88189-60e7-4f32-8ba8-062939dfa8f1.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Sekiro’s</em> 2019 keywords are not just limited to TGA Game of the Year. It can be said that <em>Sekiro</em> was a phenomenal game in 2019. The editor has summarized several key words about <em>Sekiro</em> players in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="Keyword-1-“Hesitation-is-Defeat”-“Hesitate-and-you-lose”"><a href="#Keyword-1-“Hesitation-is-Defeat”-“Hesitate-and-you-lose”" class="headerlink" title="Keyword 1: “Hesitation is Defeat” (“Hesitate and you lose”)"></a>Keyword 1: “Hesitation is Defeat” (“Hesitate and you lose”)</h2><p>“Hesitation is defeat” is a combat technique taught by Isshin Ashina, the Sword Saint, to “Wolf” in the game, just like <em>Sekiro’s</em> parrying gameplay. Players can no longer wait for the best time to attack like playing other action games. Hesitation is defeat. All players can do is pick up the sword in their hands, find the rhythm of the BOSS’s attack, and use offense to resolve the opponent’s attack. This novel action game play is nicknamed “clashing iron.” Playing <em>Sekiro</em> has also been nicknamed “going to clash iron.” Asking if someone has played <em>Sekiro</em> has become “Have you heard the sound of clashing iron in Ashina Castle at 4 am?”</p>
<p>The rise of live streaming platforms has fueled the popularity of <em>Sekiro</em>. Even if you haven’t played Sekiro, or even if you haven’t heard of Sekiro, you will definitely see “Hesitation is Defeat” frequently from March to June 2019, as well as various memes of this phrase. <em>Sekiro</em> made this phrase a popular online buzzword in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="Keyword-2-“Noob”-“Cai”"><a href="#Keyword-2-“Noob”-“Cai”" class="headerlink" title="Keyword 2: “Noob” (“Cai”)"></a>Keyword 2: “Noob” (“Cai”)</h2><p>Players failed again and again in Sekiro, and the word “死” (death) appeared on the screen again and again. Gradually, everyone found that the word “死” seemed to be less and less familiar, and they began to feel strange to it, not knowing how to write “死” - in 1960, psychologists Lambert and Jakobovits named this phenomenon “semantic satiation” (I won’t go into details here, if you are interested, please comment and forward, if there is high demand, the editor will publish a special article to explain this phenomenon).</p>
<p>Enthusiastic players began to make their own MODs on PC, replacing the word “死” with “菜” (noob&#x2F;vegetable), to encourage and mock themselves. As a result, everyone gradually found that they didn’t know how to write “菜” either.</p>
<h2 id="Keyword-3-Speedrun-and-“Cheesing”"><a href="#Keyword-3-Speedrun-and-“Cheesing”" class="headerlink" title="Keyword 3: Speedrun and “Cheesing”"></a>Keyword 3: Speedrun and “Cheesing”</h2><p>In the early days of <em>Sekiro’s</em> release, the two most popular (most viewed and commented) content about Sekiro on video websites were “speedrun” and “cheesing”. Within a week of the game’s release, expert action game players reduced the world record for Sekiro speedrun to 50 minutes and 52 seconds (from Russian player Darflesh). This means that you can buy Sekiro on Steam, beat the game, and then apply for a refund. It’s a legitimate way to “get” the game for free.</p>
<p>More interestingly, videos on video websites about “cheesing” and “copying homework” were also very popular, which can be said to be another extreme. Players are eager to defeat Genichiro Ashina, to defeat Owl, to defeat the Sword Saint. However, they are not skilled enough and their reaction is not fast enough. Therefore, this kind of cheesing video is extremely popular among players. Expert players upload some high-fault-tolerance gameplay for other players to learn, so that they can quickly beat the game.</p>
<p>I even think that this year’s “copying homework” trend on Double Eleven (Singles’ Day) is a continuation of the “copying homework” trend of Sekiro at the beginning of the year. It can be said to be a classic case of the influence of popular games on trend culture.</p>
<h2 id="Keyword-4-Sekiro-Lore"><a href="#Keyword-4-Sekiro-Lore" class="headerlink" title="Keyword 4: Sekiro Lore"></a>Keyword 4: Sekiro Lore</h2><p>Hidetaka Miyazaki’s consistent style in the Souls series is that the game’s narrative is always fragmented and incoherent. Players need to speculate on the structure of the world and the direction of the plot from the item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and even the arrangement and changes of items in the scene. <em>Sekiro</em> is no exception. Players often cannot grasp the whole story of the game in a single playthrough, or even have no idea what happened. As a result, videos on “Sekiro Lore Studies” have also received a certain amount of attention on video websites. The video authors will analyze the text and pictures in the game to analyze what happened in the world of <em>Sekiro</em>, and to speculate on what kind of story Miyazaki wants to tell the players. The editor strongly recommends the “Sekiro Lore Researcher” series by Bilibili user 龙崎棒棒糖 (Long Qi Bang Bang Tang), which is the best Sekiro plot analysis video I have ever seen.</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue"><a href="#Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2><p>In 2019, <em>Sekiro</em> brought countless joy to players. I hope that the cooperation between Miyazaki and another old thief, George R.R. Martin, can go smoothly, and that players can continue to experience pain and happiness. Let’s look forward to <em>Elden Ring</em> together.</p>

    <title>Randomness, Pseudo-Randomness, and Pseudo-Pseudo-Randomness in Games</title>
    <url>/2020/01/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20210112_28584_926555/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210112/28584_926555.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Randomness is an important characteristic that contributes to the fun of games. Every game incorporates randomness in its numerical design. Whether it’s opening loot boxes, drawing gacha, or experiencing critical hits and item drops during combat, these random probability events often leave the majority of players lamenting their bad luck, while a small minority rejoice in their good fortune. It is precisely because of this uncertainty that players have more anticipation and hope during their gaming experience. Each random outcome brings players a fresh experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210112%2Fd38f54cd-a8af-40c5-bdd6-ca80ebaf0158.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210112&#x2F;d38f54cd-a8af-40c5-bdd6-ca80ebaf0158.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="Pseudo-Randomness-and-Philosophy"><a href="#Pseudo-Randomness-and-Philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Pseudo-Randomness and Philosophy"></a>Pseudo-Randomness and Philosophy</h2><p>Just like the principle of moderation in philosophy, too little randomness reduces player enjoyment, while too much randomness affects the balance of the game. Different types of games require different degrees of randomness in different aspects. At appropriate times, it is necessary to manually intervene in randomness to ensure the game experience.</p>
<p>In computer language, 0 is 0 and 1 is 1. There is no data in a program that can be both 0 and 1. A quantum superposition state like Schrödinger’s cat cannot exist within a game program. To satisfy people’s need for randomness, programmers need to write a specific program to achieve random numerical changes within the game. In this sense, all so-called “randomness” in games is actually “pseudo-randomness” that has been manually intervened. Of course, whether all random events in nature should also be regarded as “pseudo-random” events belongs to the realm of philosophy, and we will not take up too much space to discuss it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210112%2Fbd5ca4e0-88da-4852-b5cc-8a0c5adfb519.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210112&#x2F;bd5ca4e0-88da-4852-b5cc-8a0c5adfb519.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Schrodinger’s-Cat"><a href="#Schrodinger’s-Cat" class="headerlink" title="Schrödinger’s Cat"></a><em>Schrödinger’s Cat</em></h2><h2 id="Pseudo-Pseudo-Randomness"><a href="#Pseudo-Pseudo-Randomness" class="headerlink" title="Pseudo-Pseudo-Randomness"></a>Pseudo-Pseudo-Randomness</h2><p>To prevent the random settings in the game from having a significant impact on game balance, and to protect the rights of players, most game manufacturers add some manual adjustments to the “pseudo-random” settings, namely “pseudo-pseudo-randomness”. This ensures that players with less-than-ideal luck obtain a basic gaming experience. Examples include pity systems in gacha mechanics, and making the frequency of some random skills, such as critical hits, constant during battles.</p>
<p>Let’s take the hero Axe from the game <em>Dota 2</em> as an example. One of Axe’s skills, “Counter Helix,” is described as follows: When taking basic attacks from the enemy, Axe has a chance to perform a helix counterattack, attacking all nearby enemies. In older versions, this probability followed a “random distribution,” meaning that every time Axe was attacked, there was a 17%-20% chance (which increased with level) to trigger Counter Helix. This led to situations where a lucky player using this hero might spin like a fan, achieving kills, while an unlucky player might be killed without triggering the skill even once, causing frustration.</p>
<p>In a later version, Valve adjusted all skills with “random distribution” in <em>Dota 2</em> to use “pseudo-random distribution.” This means that the actual probability of a skill triggering is different each time. Each attack that does not trigger the event increases the probability of the event occurring on the next attack. This ensures that the event will occur at least once within a fixed number of attacks&#x2F;casts. In simple terms, through manual intervention in “random events,” Valve ensured that Axe’s Counter Helix skill, at a 20% probability at max level, would trigger at least once every 5 attacks.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, randomness is important for enhancing the actual experience during the game. Adding appropriate random event gameplay in the game can effectively improve the player’s experience. Too high or too low a probability will have a negative impact. Choosing the appropriate type of randomness, pseudo-randomness, or pseudo-pseudo-randomness in the game is a decision that game designers need to make based on the game’s own gameplay attributes.</p>

    <title>Randomness and Positive Feedback Presentation in Auto Chess</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210318/28584_937546.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis of Auto Chess Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Dota 2’s Auto Chess mod suddenly became popular. After its launch, <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> became the number one map in the DOTA 2 Workshop, with an average daily online presence of 300,000. With the launch of other auto chess games in the future, I believe there is still a lot of room for optimization in auto chess.</p>
<p>Auto chess incorporates and optimizes the gameplay of mahjong, with automatic battles, a low learning curve, high randomness, and points for comebacks. There are many points where you can get happiness in random confrontations, rather than only the first place being able to get happiness.</p>
<p>So how do the auto chess games on the market show their randomness in the game interface, and provide real-time positive feedback to players?</p>
<p><strong>Randomness</strong></p>
<p>Randomness is mainly concentrated in the interface for selecting pieces. In <em>Auto Chess</em> (Drodo) &#x2F; <em>Dota Auto Chess</em>, this is mainly reflected in the pop-up window for displaying pieces during the battle interlude. It only pops up automatically during the battle interlude, and is not a permanent window. To call it up, you need to click the gold button or the chess piece button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210318%2F23562cc0-5838-4634-83d9-215a117c2e0c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210318&#x2F;23562cc0-5838-4634-83d9-215a117c2e0c.jpg"></p>

<p>Here, in order to emphasize its randomness, owned pieces or recommended pieces will have special effects around them, and there will also be upgrade prompts. <em>Arena of Evolution: Red Tides</em> even has a “luck rating”.</p>

<p><em>Teamfight Tactics</em> has it as a permanent page at the bottom. (Permanent menus are more friendly on the PC side. <em>Justice Online</em>‘s <em>Fight for Freedom</em> made it into a switchable piece pool.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210318%2F60f1432e-98f0-4d55-9b66-b0882f287dc8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210318&#x2F;60f1432e-98f0-4d55-9b66-b0882f287dc8.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Justice Online’s Fight For Freedom</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Positive Feedback</strong></p>
<p>The probability of each round of pieces appearing itself will bring certain positive feedback to the player, especially when there are two one-star pieces and the third one-star piece is drawn, when the key lineup card is drawn, and when the opponent of this round is defeated, there is a feeling of being the chosen one. (In contrast, the negative feedback content such as not drawing the card is not so strong.)</p>
<p>In addition, after the end of each game, there is a settlement interface. Some have a settlement interface that tells the player the income of each round (including losing streak income) and the skill gold bonus in some game mechanisms; others have the income display appearing in the battle interface. <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> will accumulate 10 gold coins into a golden shell on one side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210318%2F63baa8db-9eb6-433a-89f1-f88711b3272a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210318&#x2F;63baa8db-9eb6-433a-89f1-f88711b3272a.jpg"></p>

<hr>
<p>But there is a problem with auto chess, that is, the length of time for each group of players to finish the current round is different. While waiting for other players to finish the game, some players may upgrade their pieces, etc. If you need to constantly switch perspectives to get this information, it is easy to miss your own chess selection time.</p>
<p><strong>How to solve the problem of switching between rounds?</strong></p>
<p>Some star-up information or victory information, etc., are realized by some auto chess games through bullet comments (danmu - 弹幕).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210318%2Fe5ade8b0-35e3-4f0f-b3c6-830c0f696e35.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210318&#x2F;e5ade8b0-35e3-4f0f-b3c6-830c0f696e35.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Dota Auto Chess Bullet Comments</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Round Division</strong></p>
<p>In order to clearly divide the rounds, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> and <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> both use scene switching to distinguish.</p>
<p><em>Teamfight Tactics</em> realizes scene switching through the shuttle of different spaces, while <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> switches through the illumination of day and night.</p>

    <title>Game Community Research (2): Haoyou Kuaibao (AppChina)</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20210323_28584_938308/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A game community refers to an online community composed of a group of game-loving netizens who specifically discuss and interact with games and game-related content. It has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) It has a certain entry threshold;</p>
<p>(2) It has a specific space for communication and interaction;</p>
<p>(3) It produces content around specific topics.</p>
<p>For us game practitioners, the game community is a very important platform for interacting with players and conducting game marketing activities, because it allows us to better understand the preferences of players with rich game experience and high game skills for game mechanics and content. In the first<br>date: November 29, 2019), we introduced TapTap, a professional game community with a clear access mechanism, a strong interactive atmosphere among community members, and a commitment to high-quality game reviews. In this article, we will introduce another well-known game community platform - Haoyou Kuaibao (AppChina). Although it has some similarities with TapTap in terms of service content and member profiles, Haoyou Kuaibao also has its own unique positioning, which also affects the game marketing and operation strategies of game practitioners to a large extent.<br>categories:<br>    - NetEase UX<br>-## Part Two: Haoyou Kuaibao (AppChina)</p>
<p>Haoyou Kuaibao is a game enthusiast community developed by Xiamen Chunyou Interactive Technology Co., Ltd. In Haoyou Kuaibao, users can follow the real-time trends of the mobile game market through the rankings, and they can also experience beta versions of new games first and publish game reviews to communicate with millions of game enthusiasts and game developers. Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao has the following two unique service positions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focusing on the “Game Guides + Toolbox” integrated module as the main content feature:</strong> Compared with TapTap, which focuses on user social interaction and community operation, Haoyou Kuaibao is more practical - it focuses on meeting the specific needs of players to “play”. The main content feature of Haoyou Kuaibao is the integrated module of “Game Guides + Toolbox”, that is, players can not only share game guides in game reviews, but also launch self-created auxiliary tools for high-traffic games with a certain learning threshold, such as network accelerators, <em>Clash Royale</em> deck builders, <em>Arena of Valor</em> rune simulators, etc. In the main page of the Haoyou Kuaibao App, there are many entrances to game guides&#x2F;toolboxes, and they are all in a prominent position on the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F8d80454b-a85a-458a-b313-bb390685215d.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;8d80454b-a85a-458a-b313-bb390685215d.jpg"></p>
<p>Haoyou Kuaibao’s Toolbox Page</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Fd097be48-eebd-4da0-b45a-c1b0cff0b119.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;d097be48-eebd-4da0-b45a-c1b0cff0b119.jpg"></p>
<p>Different Toolbox&#x2F;Guide Entrances on the Haoyou Kuaibao Page</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Focusing on letting players recommend games independently:</strong> In the introduction of the previous article, we can know that TapTap values the cultivation of high-quality game review content, which requires TapTap to take the “high-end, elegant, and classy” “elite” route in user group cultivation and game review screening, that is, the reviews and guides written by players with rich game experience and high game skills are more credible and more likely to be recommended by TapTap editors, becoming an important force affecting the game experience and evaluation of other ordinary players. Different from TapTap, by setting up a distinctive player self-recommendation game list function, Haoyou Kuaibao gives more ordinary players the opportunity to independently recommend and review games. In the “Novelty - Game List” module on the App’s homepage, players can search for or create popular game lists. The games included in the list reflect more of the players’ personal preferences, rather than professionally evaluated and more popular games.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F3861992c-c377-4fb6-b660-5b369977e18c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;3861992c-c377-4fb6-b660-5b369977e18c.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Fac71c8db-418f-41d1-9aa9-def21f27198a.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;ac71c8db-418f-41d1-9aa9-def21f27198a.jpg"><br>Haoyou Kuaibao’s User-Created Game List Page, with a page style similar to NetEase Cloud Music’s Song List.</p>
<p>Why are there these significant differences between Haoyou Kuaibao and TapTap in service positioning and content features? This is related to the differences in user groups between the two. Compared with TapTap, what are the profile characteristics of Haoyou Kuaibao users? Do they have preferences for specific game categories and mechanics? By querying the Baidu Index (time window: September 29, 2019 - October 28, 2019) and referring to other industry reports, we obtained the following user profile information of Haoyou Kuaibao:</p>
<p>(1) User gender distribution: Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao users have a relatively balanced gender distribution, with slightly more males than females.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F32c12802-3b82-4b0e-bce6-1d638303d867.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;32c12802-3b82-4b0e-bce6-1d638303d867.jpg"></p>
<p>(2) User age distribution: Compared with TapTap, Haoyou Kuaibao users are older on average, with the highest proportion of users aged 30-39, exceeding 50%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Ff2e55c7d-c1a7-4791-8ddd-7a3de15c37a2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;f2e55c7d-c1a7-4791-8ddd-7a3de15c37a2.jpg"></p>
<p>(3) User geographic distribution: Compared with TapTap users who are mostly distributed in coastal areas, a considerable number of Haoyou Kuaibao users are distributed in central provinces. If calculated according to the frequency of users searching for Haoyou Kuaibao in various places, Henan, Hebei and other central provinces rank prominently, surpassing coastal provinces such as Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F216564ba-47e1-47ac-b9fa-4a682d3de2ac.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;216564ba-47e1-47ac-b9fa-4a682d3de2ac.png"><br>TapTap user geographic distribution, it can be seen that its users are mostly distributed in coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F3346c700-3519-44e7-88da-7bec8053816f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;3346c700-3519-44e7-88da-7bec8053816f.png"><br>Haoyou Kuaibao user geographic distribution, it can be seen that a considerable number of users are distributed in Henan and Hebei.</p>
<p>(4) User game preference: According to the introduction of the previous article, we can conclude that TapTap users relatively prefer indie games, and they rate games with innovative gameplay higher than popular game categories. In contrast, based on the research on the shortlist of Haoyou Kuaibao’s 2018 Best Game and Most Popular Game, we found that Haoyou Kuaibao users have a higher acceptance of popular games from major manufacturers. <em>PUBG Mobile</em> even won the Most Popular Game of the Year award. At the same time, compared with TapTap users, Haoyou Kuaibao users also prefer a more diverse range of game types, covering the popular battle royale, FPS, RPG, MOBA and the relatively niche sandbox and survival genres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2F034e94d2-18ea-4838-9dd1-a6e789c3cf72.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;034e94d2-18ea-4838-9dd1-a6e789c3cf72.jpg"></p>
<p>The red circles in the table indicate the games nominated for the 2018 Haoyou Kuaibao Best&#x2F;Most Popular Game by two major domestic game manufacturers - Tencent and NetEase. It can be seen that Haoyou Kuaibao users have a high acceptance of games produced by domestic major manufacturers</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210323%2Fbeb5a711-1801-470c-ae99-8b4ee2bbe399.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210323&#x2F;beb5a711-1801-470c-ae99-8b4ee2bbe399.jpg"></p>
<p>From the nomination of Haoyou Kuaibao’s 2018 Best&#x2F;Most Popular Game, it can be seen that its users prefer a more diverse range of game categories. Compared with TapTap users, Haoyou Kuaibao users have a higher acceptance of popular game categories</p>
<p>Conclusion: From the above analysis, we draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) As a game community, Haoyou Kuaibao: Compared with TapTap, it has a lower entry threshold, a more diverse user group, and focuses on meeting players’ practical needs for “playing”.</p>
<p>(2) As a member of such a game community: They may be relatively older and have a preference for popular game categories and gameplay.</p>

<p>Why does entering UNO feel like entering a black hole of happy time? Fun is a very complex word, with more dimensions than pleasure. There are many theories that explain the fun of games. Today, we will start with two perspectives: reinforcement theory and flow theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20200427%2Ff6b43234-81e2-4014-89bb-f9173c2e30a5.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20200427&#x2F;f6b43234-81e2-4014-89bb-f9173c2e30a5.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Official UNO mobile game “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Reinforcement-Theory-Skinner’s-Reinforcement-Theory"><a href="#Reinforcement-Theory-Skinner’s-Reinforcement-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Reinforcement Theory (Skinner’s Reinforcement Theory)"></a>Reinforcement Theory (Skinner’s Reinforcement Theory)</h2><p>Reinforcement theory was proposed by Skinner, also known as the operant conditioning theory. Positive reinforcement is more commonly used in games. Positive reinforcement, also known as positive reinforcement, simply means that by adding a certain stimulus, the probability of a certain behavior increases. For example, Xiao You completes her homework on time every day and gets 30 minutes of UNO time. In order to get 30 minutes of UNO time, Xiao You completes her homework on time every day. Thus, a connection is established: completing homework on time will be rewarded, and the reward brings happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Fcb05ffd4-9b6e-4a80-abc7-33aa543ac285.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;cb05ffd4-9b6e-4a80-abc7-33aa543ac285.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Skinner’s Operant Conditioning</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So how is reinforcement theory applied to games? By rationally utilizing the reinforcement formula, linking rewards to certain behaviors, and increasing the individual’s sense of gain and achievement, players can experience more fun.</p>
<p>Application of reinforcement theory: In the game “UNO!”, winning a game will earn coins. This is a kind of positive reinforcement. I win, I can get rewards, and thus get more satisfaction. Moreover, in order to expand the impact of this positive reinforcement, very rich special effects are usually used. This feeling of coins flying all over the sky, doesn’t it give a great sense of gain and achievement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Faac3aec2-1885-4008-961b-f08b95327e61.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;aac3aec2-1885-4008-961b-f08b95327e61.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players win a lot of coins in the high-stakes arena of “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Reinforcement theory is more biased towards the behavioral level. Players are reinforced by this, feel happy, and will invest more frequently in the game. But players don’t always win. Sometimes, due to the increased difficulty of the game, they will lose ten times in a row or be punished with 16 cards. So why are players still enjoying it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Fbb5b3387-f095-454d-b4f3-af3c4c5078be.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;bb5b3387-f095-454d-b4f3-af3c4c5078be.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players experience a ten-game losing streak in “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Flow-Theory-Mental-Flow"><a href="#Flow-Theory-Mental-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Flow Theory (Mental Flow)"></a>Flow Theory (Mental Flow)</h2><p>Flow theory was proposed by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He defined flow as a feeling of complete focus of one’s mental energy on a certain activity; when flow occurs, there is also a high degree of excitement and fulfillment. The generation of flow needs to consider five dimensions: challenge and skill, anxiety and boredom, and difficulty balance. In the figure below, A is our player. He will have different states due to the level of challenge difficulty and his own ability level. For example, if a high-difficulty challenge is matched with a low skill level, the player will be very anxious; if a low-difficulty challenge is matched with a high skill level, the player will be very bored. Only when the appropriate difficulty challenge is matched with the appropriate skill level will the player be in a state of flow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F48091321-fb57-4550-ba34-59b9d924e2a3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;48091321-fb57-4550-ba34-59b9d924e2a3.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Flow Channel (from Jesse Schell’s “The Art of Game Design”)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of game design is to adjust the appropriate difficulty so that players are always in a state of flow and get a very satisfying feeling. In the figure below, players reach the first stage (world1) with only a relatively low skill level, while reaching the last stage requires a very high skill level. This stage is the player’s growth process. In games, for example, in the “UNO!” novice tutorial, various gameplays are opened in sequence. Players need to learn how to play the classic mode first, and only after upgrading to level xx will other gameplays such as competitive events be unlocked. This kind of teaching conforms to the growth process of flow and is more likely to make players feel excited and satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study of Applying Flow Theory: “UNO!” Ranked Mode</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F84664d95-dc6a-4bd3-ab4a-ab67db15f6de.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;84664d95-dc6a-4bd3-ab4a-ab67db15f6de.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ranked Mode in “UNO!”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the current ranked match of “UNO!”, players can be matched with players one level above or below their own rank. In other words, players will always be matched with players of similar skill levels, so players are always challenging “appropriate difficulty” and are more likely to be in a state of flow. So why do players still want to continue playing even if they lose? From the perspective of flow, the flow state that players have experienced before gives them a foundation of skills and a psychological state of satisfaction and confidence, and they are more convinced that they can challenge this difficulty. Think about it, if you lose a ranked match, you always feel that “my skills should be fine, I was just unlucky, I will definitely win the next one.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F9dd3f50e-26d5-4f82-85a6-892e1f46c49e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210325&#x2F;9dd3f50e-26d5-4f82-85a6-892e1f46c49e.png"></p>

<p>The fun of games is still a relatively complex topic. In addition to reinforcement theory and flow theory, some scholars explain the fun of games from the perspective of evolutionary psychology and behavioral economics. So here’s a small question for everyone to think about. Why do people especially like to participate in game competitions?</p>

    <title>Applying the Hook Model to UNO!: How Do Players Get &#39;Addicted&#39;?</title>
    <url>/2020/05/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20210325_28584_938878/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210325/28584_938878.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an <em>UNO!</em> enthusiast, I often claim that “I’m addicted to playing UNO!”, but why am I addicted? Where does the “addiction” come from? In fact, it can be explained by a very specific model, namely the famous “Hook Model”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F3c74d161-4c35-4722-97c4-70ea3fb2506c.png/size/" alt="Hook Model"></p>
<p>The Hook Model was proposed by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover, authors of <em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em>. They attribute addiction to “behaviors done with little or no conscious thought.” And how to become “addicted” requires the four product elements of the Hook Model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong></li>
<li><strong>Action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Variable Reward</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Trigger"><a href="#Trigger" class="headerlink" title="Trigger"></a>Trigger</h3><p>“Trigger” is the first step of the Hook Model. If this step cannot arouse the user’s interest, the follow-up is out of the question. There are two forms of triggers: “external triggers” and “internal triggers”.</p>
<p>External triggers are external information that induces users to take action and enter the system. The external triggers after the launch of <em>UNO!</em> include: recommendations from app stores (including TapTap), information pushes on platforms such as Weibo and WeChat official accounts, and friend invitations among UNO players. It is worth mentioning that KOL (Key Opinion Leader) promotion is also an extremely effective external trigger. Many <em>UNO!</em> players said that they were hooked after watching the live broadcast of the famous up-host “Xiaoyao Sanren”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F2a352ee0-29f8-4dea-b82e-f89b6126bfc7.png/size/" alt="Xiaoyao Sanren&#39;s video"></p>
<p>Internal triggers are user self-directed triggers driven by their own emotions. Studies have shown that negative emotions, such as loneliness, fear, frustration, and confusion, can even affect our behavior more than positive emotions. The initial launch of <em>UNO!</em> coincided with the period of domestic epidemic, many users were isolated at home and felt bored and lonely, eager to communicate with others, and were very likely to get into new games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F9225403a-9464-435e-a35f-68465463fd74.png/size/" alt="The psychological journey before and after playing UNO"></p>
<h3 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h3><p>After the trigger, it is to make the user take action. The Hook Model is built on the Behavior Model of Stanford professor Bijou, that is, behavior &#x3D; motivation + ability + trigger. In life, no matter what we do, we have various motivations, and <em>UNO!</em> satisfies the following needs of users in terms of motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sociality</strong>: The two-player mode and room mode with limited free room cards in <em>UNO!</em> allow players to play with friends, especially former board game players, who can experience UNO cards online.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of Achievement</strong>: The ranking system, World Cup, various leaderboards, and rankings among friends can stimulate players to continuously challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Ability</strong>: that is, the user’s ability to complete the desired action. In terms of ability, the threshold of <em>UNO!</em> is low, and the low cost of user input makes it easy to get started:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Ffb139808-150d-4bbf-9e3f-bb1540fa113e.png/size/" alt="Three-minute time limit"></p>
<ol>
<li>The game time is short, basically 3 minutes per round.</li>
<li>The operation mode is simple, which is to draw cards and play cards, and occasionally there will be functional card options such as challenges and stacking.</li>
<li>The game rules are simple, and there are only two situations to win: play all the cards or have the lowest score when the time is up.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a sufficiently low threshold, the addition of the ranking system and custom rooms allows players of the same level to match each other, retaining high-level players.</p>
<h3 id="Variable-Reward"><a href="#Variable-Reward" class="headerlink" title="Variable Reward"></a>Variable Reward</h3><p>After the behavior is triggered, it is necessary to give users some rewards for continuous stimulation in order to cultivate their usage habits. But rewards alone are not enough, and Variable Rewards can make users truly “addicted”. Behavioral research shows that people’s satisfaction with products will gradually decrease over time. Maintaining variability can ensure the mystery and attractiveness of products, and maintain users’ long-term interest, which is also the reason why all games need to be updated regularly. The rewards in the Hook Model include three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Rewards</strong>: That is, cooperation and competition, sense of identity, and interpersonal rewards generated by interacting with others. The two-player mode of <em>UNO!</em> can freely match unfamiliar teammates. In the game, you can give flowers and rotten eggs to your teammates. “Not knowing what kind of teammates you will encounter” is an unknown expectation. The daily exchange of gold coins between game friends, the leaderboard, and the ability to open a room to customize the rules of the game, all give players the motivation to participate in cooperation and competition in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2Fb17410b4-5206-487d-9ab9-019e104bb67d.png/size/" alt="Can match with strangers to become teammates"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunt Rewards</strong>: That is, the specific resources or exclusive information obtained. <em>UNO!</em> has high-multiplier mode such as 40x and 80x. Once you win, you can get a lot of money. This kind of high-intensity reward stimulation will give players the desire to continuously challenge. In fact, all gold coins and prop rewards in the game belong to the category of hunt rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F3e5f65c7-891e-489e-a715-213967654b9d.png/size/" alt="High-multiplier rounds can get more gold coins"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self Rewards</strong>: That is, the sense of control, achievement, and other self-emotional rewards experienced from the product. <em>UNO!</em> has set different ranks, and self-recognition can be obtained through promotion. The World Cup “representing China” also gives players a sense of honor and achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F9b63bcf8-5228-4663-af96-2be7dfb9fc50.png/size/" alt="There are big differences between ranks"></p>
<h3 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h3><p>Psychological research shows that the time and energy a user invests in something is directly proportional to the degree of dependence, just like you won’t cherish free things, but you will recharge more and more in paid games. Therefore, the last step of “addiction” is to invest.</p>
<p>The simplest investment is time and money. When a person has played 200 rounds of UNO or recharged 200 yuan of gold coins, no matter how many gold coins he has left or whether he is bankrupt, he will want to get more or even multiple times more gold coins, and will further invest in the game.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <em>UNO!</em> is a game with a low entry barrier, but it is not easy to become a master. It requires a process of learning and continuous practice, which is also an investment in self-improvement. When you become a master of a game, it will be more difficult for you to leave the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210325%2F4c502198-d6e6-49ec-ba9a-29e7bce893ea.png/size/" alt="Masters are &quot;on the list&quot;"></p>
<p>In addition, the accumulated appearance and ranking in the game are also an investment in “content” and “data”.</p>

    <title>[User Research] From UNO to the Street Vendor Economy - Anchoring and Reciprocity Principles in Consumer Psychology</title>
    <url>/2020/06/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20210331_28584_939715/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210331/28584_939715.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, the street vendor economy has become very popular. While surfing the internet, I found that everyone is setting up stalls, and there is a lively atmosphere everywhere. As a game developer, I am not to be outdone. I want to discuss with everyone how to use the experience of making games to become the king of street vendors, and introduce how consumer psychology effects can be applied from games to street vending. This sharing uses the official UNO mobile game <em>UNO!™</em> as a case study.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F413937a6-5608-47f0-a820-2c4ca2c6b044.png/size/" alt="UNO!™ Dev Team Setting Up a Stall"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Anchoring-Effect"><a href="#Anchoring-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Anchoring Effect"></a>Anchoring Effect</h2><p>The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for individuals to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the “anchor”) when making estimates or decisions, even if that information is irrelevant. When making decisions, people unconsciously give too much weight to the information they first obtain. For example, when a salesperson wants to visit a customer, they will specifically propose a time to visit, such as “Are you free at two o’clock on Saturday?” If the customer is not available, they will generally look for another suitable time based on this time, rather than setting aside the “two o’clock on Saturday” time anchor and expressing that they do not need to meet the salesperson.</p>
<p>In the <em>UNO!™</em> game, you will see some discounted items. Discounted items are often marked with the original price and the discounted price. Since the discounted price already provides the information, why mark the original price? The original price is the “anchor”, which affects your estimated value of this item. When you estimate the value of this item to be 10 diamonds, but now you can buy it for 8 diamonds or even 5 diamonds, wouldn’t you think “it’s a steal, buy!”</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F907ec0cc-a290-452c-92c9-7d2821ce20e7.png/size/" alt="Important UNO!™ Item, Shields, Are Sometimes Sold at a Discount"></p>
<p>Then when we go to set up a street stall, we can use this experience. Whether we want to sell clothes or snacks, don’t forget to give customers an “anchor” first, quietly lock the value of the goods, and then give customers a discount, so that customers have a feeling of “getting a bargain”. Of course, it should also be noted that if this “anchor” deviates too far from the value of the goods, it will not be effective.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F3b9ad5a3-3635-44c7-a262-e2e7d04e67a1.png/size/" alt="An Exaggerated Anchor Will Make Customers Feel It&#39;s Too Exaggerated"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Reciprocity-Principle"><a href="#Reciprocity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Reciprocity Principle"></a>Reciprocity Principle</h2><p>The reciprocity principle suggests that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. In summary, it is a behavior that should be reciprocated with a similar behavior. For example, on your birthday, someone gave you a birthday present. Then you must be thinking about giving him a birthday present on his birthday, or giving him some gifts at other suitable times.</p>
<p>In the <em>UNO!™</em> game, players can give each other coins. If a friend gives you ten coins, then you must be thinking about giving them back. If your daily coin gifting limit is used up, and you play a game with him, you may also want to give him a small gift in the game to give back.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fbb10463b-2d65-491d-b3da-e4dcec9578c1.png/size/" alt="Players Can Give and Receive Coins from Friends in the Social Function"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F359f78ae-df76-4bfe-8578-c023fe65ca36.png/size/" alt="Players Can Give Gifts to Each Other in Matches"></p>
<p>So how can the reciprocity principle be applied to street vending? Suppose we go to set up a stall to sell fruit and occupy a high-traffic area of the street. We pull in passers-by for free tastings. People who have eaten the fruit will want to reciprocate with some behavior, and may choose to buy some fruit, or of course they may say thank you. Stalls selling clothes don’t have tastings, but don’t worry, put two buckets of low-cost flowers at the door, and give one to everyone who passes by. Someone holding a flower will always want to give back to you, and by the way, take a look at the clothes and buy some clothes.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fe94873fd-caad-4d79-9ce9-a35174172171.png/size/" alt="Reciprocity Between Merchants and Customers"></p>
<p>I have to say, psychology is really everywhere in daily life and games. Using game experience to become the king of street vendors, we game people never give up. Leave a small question, what is going on with the queuing to enter the server in the game and the “shills” at the entrance of the milk tea shop?</p>

    <title>Introduction to Flat Illustration Design</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20210331_28584_939794/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Illustration, as an art form, with its intuitive imagery and profound appeal, can attract the attention of a wide range of consumers in commercial applications, and also has strong communication power.</p>
<p>Therefore, illustrations are widely used in advertising, posters, product packaging, web pages and other platforms, such as <em>Monument Valley</em>, the packaging of Cha Pi (茶π), and Ziroom’s splash screen. Against this background, flat illustration emerged as a relatively popular illustration style.</p>
<p>Next, we will understand the principles and production of flat illustration, roughly learn and grasp the main points, and create our own flat illustrations.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Flat-Illustration"><a href="#What-is-Flat-Illustration" class="headerlink" title="What is Flat Illustration?"></a>What is Flat Illustration?</h2><p>Flat illustration is a non-realistic illustration technique that summarizes the outline of an object, extracts its features, and retains the original recognizability of the object. It is generally drawn by combining and changing basic geometric shapes (ellipses, circles, triangles, rectangles, etc.).</p>
<p>Flat illustration has the advantages of high versatility (wide application), easy to get started, short production time, and good effect, and the picture is simple, the subject is clear, and the “information” to be displayed can be highlighted. Therefore, it is highly praised by illustrators and designers.</p>
<p>For example, in the mobile game <em>UNO!</em>, the map part of the “World Tour” mode is a typical example of the application of flat illustration.</p>
<p>Because the overall game style is relatively clean and simple, it is not suitable for realistic depictions with too many details. In this case, simply flattening the photo (landmark building) can achieve the effect of retaining regional characteristics and perfectly integrating with the game, and the picture can also be appropriately beautified according to needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Ffc408599-4ee0-4827-b452-72f27e06813f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;fc408599-4ee0-4827-b452-72f27e06813f.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="Flat-Illustration-Deconstruction"><a href="#Flat-Illustration-Deconstruction" class="headerlink" title="Flat Illustration Deconstruction"></a>Flat Illustration Deconstruction</h2><p>Since flat illustration is basically composed of simple geometric shapes, complex illustrations can be deconstructed into combinations of multiple geometries.</p>
<p>The following uses a few simple icon examples to illustrate the basic expression forms of flat illustration.</p>
<p><strong>① Solid Color Blocks</strong></p>
<p>The basic shape is obtained through Boolean operations, and simple color blocks are laid flat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F636a2f4d-1368-4b9e-92cf-7084baaa62f2.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;636a2f4d-1368-4b9e-92cf-7084baaa62f2.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F559ee611-ceae-4b82-8a2d-102d5a62fd50.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;559ee611-ceae-4b82-8a2d-102d5a62fd50.png"></p>
<p><strong>② Lines</strong></p>
<p>Use lines to shape the outline</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fa99c5c0e-e50e-4990-b9d9-4f020868300a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;a99c5c0e-e50e-4990-b9d9-4f020868300a.png"></p>
<p><strong>③ Gradient</strong></p>
<p>Also on the basis of color blocks and lines, gradient processing is performed on the color blocks to increase details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F8e12ef7a-46d1-48fb-96ca-2545941632e5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;8e12ef7a-46d1-48fb-96ca-2545941632e5.png"></p>
<p><strong>④ Color Overlay</strong></p>
<p>Use methods such as reducing opacity to achieve a rich picture effect through color overlay contrast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F1482b9ea-5a8e-444c-9755-12ef63c8fbb2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;1482b9ea-5a8e-444c-9755-12ef63c8fbb2.png"></p>
<p><strong>⑤ Texture</strong></p>
<p>Flat texture is a very popular style.</p>
<p>It aims to use grain effects, textures, etc. to enhance the texture of the illustration and increase the durability of the picture.</p>
<p>Grain texture effects can be used to add a sense of space to the foreground and background, or to add shadows and highlights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fdad7af4a-77fe-4429-b6a6-29501fd379db.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;dad7af4a-77fe-4429-b6a6-29501fd379db.png"></p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>Recommended tools for beginners here include AI, PS, drawing tablets, etc.</p>
<p>The steps for beginners can be divided into copying, semi-original, and original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F2df7f5ec-1e59-42b8-88f4-5bea0722f206.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;2df7f5ec-1e59-42b8-88f4-5bea0722f206.png"></p>
<p><strong>① Copying</strong></p>
<p>Copying is the simplest.</p>
<p>What we have to do is find a picture we like and copy a picture as similar as possible next to it.</p>
<p>This can familiarize you with the operation of the software, such as shortcut keys, some small skills, etc.; on the other hand, by copying, you can roughly understand the completion process of a picture and the expression of professional illustrators.</p>
<p><strong>② Semi-original</strong></p>
<p>The semi-original here refers to taking a photo and performing simple artistic processing on it.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if the final image is to be used commercially, then you must pay attention to copyright issues. Therefore, the photos we choose should meet the following two conditions:</p>
<p>One is that the subject of the photo has no copyright, such as a roadside rose;</p>
<p>The second is that the photo is preferably taken by yourself. If it is someone else’s photograph, be sure not to pick those photos with special shooting angles, as this type of photo also belongs to the author’s creation.</p>
<p>In addition, for the selection of photos for secondary creation, it is recommended that beginners choose front or full-side views as much as possible. In this way, there is less interference from perspective when drawing, and try to choose things with clean outlines to reduce the difficulty of outline extraction.</p>
<p>Next, we will use a brief process demonstration to talk about how to create flat illustrations. If you are interested, come and try it out~</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Take a photo you are interested in and analyze it</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F9bf75e82-e966-4402-9f1c-9d29f83b5ffc.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;9bf75e82-e966-4402-9f1c-9d29f83b5ffc.jpg"></p>
<p>The entire Christmas decoration actually has a lot of details. Keep in mind the suggestions just now, choose the front + outline feel, so you must first crop the photo content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fc2023afe-cc88-4a31-8272-f884aaa998c3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;c2023afe-cc88-4a31-8272-f884aaa998c3.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Create a new artboard in AI and reduce the opacity of the photo</strong></p>
<p>Create a new A4 size file in AI, drag the picture in and adjust the opacity.</p>
<p>This can be adjusted according to your own comfort, to ensure that you can see the structure without affecting the next step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fbbc87e1c-3ba8-43da-8703-3588868cb791.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;bbc87e1c-3ba8-43da-8703-3588868cb791.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Extract the outline</strong></p>
<p>Note that you don’t have to restore the photo one-to-one, try to summarize it with complete geometry</p>
<p>(Note: For specific operations on AI, you can search for relevant tutorials online~)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fe8158ba4-e9c0-4f0a-a142-b446d85d8459.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;e8158ba4-e9c0-4f0a-a142-b446d85d8459.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Fill in the color</strong></p>
<p>Use different colors to distinguish different hierarchical relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F6996b1ec-23c0-448a-af58-5612412691d8.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;6996b1ec-23c0-448a-af58-5612412691d8.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to draw the required parts</strong></p>
<p>Then adjust some of the sizes and positions, and you can get the following picture that is roughly close to completion.</p>
<p>(Note: This part requires a lot of patience, and you may feel bored when drawing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Ff1e13a89-f3e5-4073-a97b-1dd8acf66541.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;f1e13a89-f3e5-4073-a97b-1dd8acf66541.png"></p>
<p>The following steps are slightly difficult, and beginners can choose to learn:</p>
<p><strong>Step 6. Enrich the picture</strong></p>
<p>You can add some scene content around it to fill it~</p>
<p>At this point, a simple pure flat illustration is almost complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fa1ef4639-345b-4706-ac83-5d7e236ac1df.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;a1ef4639-345b-4706-ac83-5d7e236ac1df.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 7. Add texture</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the picture richer and more beautiful, we can add a layer of texture in PS.</p>
<p>Remember what I said in the previous introduction? Graininess can be used to express the dark or highlight of an object.</p>
<p>So when drawing texture, you can choose different colors to draw in the dark or highlight positions, remember to check the entire picture content~</p>
<p>Add some missing details, and you can also adjust the color scheme if you don’t think it looks good before,锵锵锵~ (onomatopoeia)</p>
<p>(Note: The grain effect can be achieved with Dissolve + Airbrush in PS. For detailed tutorials, you can search for it yourself.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fdfcde5ef-ebba-44c3-8fb9-287b324277d9.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;dfcde5ef-ebba-44c3-8fb9-287b324277d9.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 8. Try to make the windmill in the picture move!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fddd51ef1-a632-49f2-991f-dbe40c2c8e8b.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;ddd51ef1-a632-49f2-991f-dbe40c2c8e8b.gif"></p>
<p><strong>③ Original</strong></p>
<p>After mastering the operation of copying and semi-original, it is very simple to create original works~</p>
<p>Just find a few more photo materials for reference, and then choose different content for combination and creativity, and it will be your own original work~</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The above is the idea process of getting started with flat illustration.</p>
<p>First of all, you must have a certain understanding of flat illustration, including understanding what flat illustration is and what its expression techniques are.</p>
<p>Then it is to deconstruct the object information and summarize it with geometry as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that beginners must copy a lot when getting started, and summarize the rules of extracting object outlines, that is, how to better express object characteristics with geometry.</p>
<p>In the process of copying, you must proceed step by step, starting with simple icons, and then to complete illustrations; when you have accumulated a certain amount, you can start to try semi-original or original.</p>
<p>By then, you have accumulated a lot of materials in your mind, and it will be easier to draw.</p>
<p>I hope everyone can draw beautiful illustrations~</p>

    <title>Gestalt Principles - Making Design Easier (Part 1)</title>
    <url>/2020/08/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20210331_28584_939884/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210331/28584_939884.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Gestalt principles are a fundamental theory in design, widely used in many aspects of visual design and interaction design.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Gestalt principles to make design easier.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Gestalt-Principles"><a href="#What-are-Gestalt-Principles" class="headerlink" title="What are Gestalt Principles?"></a>What are Gestalt Principles?</h2><p>Gestalt is the transliteration of the German word “Gestalt”, which means form, shape, or structure.</p>
<p>Gestalt principles are actually a psychological concept, also known as Gestalt psychology.</p>
<p>Gestalt psychology mainly studies the visual and sensory fields, advocating the integrity of perception.</p>
<p>The human vision has a tendency to generalize and simplify graphics.</p>
<p>In other words, when we look at things, the eyes and brain work together.</p>
<p>It is not to distinguish the individual components of an image at the beginning, but to combine the various parts into a more easily understood unity.</p>
<p>Gestalt principles include multiple principles. Here we mainly share four of them: similarity, proximity, closure, and continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F91984a67-0274-49ca-bb86-88e1f7297fde.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;91984a67-0274-49ca-bb86-88e1f7297fde.png"></p>
<h3 id="①-Principle-of-Similarity"><a href="#①-Principle-of-Similarity" class="headerlink" title="① Principle of Similarity"></a>① Principle of Similarity</h3><p>The meaning of the principle of similarity is very simple, that is, elements that are similar in a certain aspect tend to form a whole.</p>
<p>For example, in the figure below, people’s first impression of this picture is 2 kinds of circles, not 15 circles.</p>
<p>This is because our eyes and brains automatically group the solid circles into one group and the hollow circles into another group.</p>

<p><em>People usually think of it as 2 kinds of circles instead of 15 circles</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When elements are similar in shape, size, or color, the principle of similarity can work.</p>
<p>For example, in the figure below, we can easily distinguish between similar and different, and group similar ones together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F7ed9833a-da37-4d87-b9c3-eb12f146f459.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;7ed9833a-da37-4d87-b9c3-eb12f146f459.png"></p>

<h3 id="②-Principle-of-Proximity"><a href="#②-Principle-of-Proximity" class="headerlink" title="② Principle of Proximity"></a>② Principle of Proximity</h3><p>The principle of proximity means that elements that are close in distance or position tend to form a whole.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, we will naturally think that these are 3 groups of circles, not 6 independent circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F0824238b-c9b2-4512-9fe7-b12e50775b62.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;0824238b-c9b2-4512-9fe7-b12e50775b62.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>We will naturally think that these are 3 groups of circles, not 6 independent circles</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Proximity is actually the primary principle of Gestalt, and its influence is so great that it can offset other principles.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, even if the shapes are not similar or the colors are not similar, as long as the distance between the elements is close enough, we will be more inclined to regard them as a group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F730ac902-a3d9-42a4-9d11-06c7413ffecd.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;730ac902-a3d9-42a4-9d11-06c7413ffecd.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>When the distance between elements is close enough, they tend to be regarded as a whole even if they are not similar</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Generally speaking, proximity &gt; color similarity &gt; shape similarity. The arrangement of the three groups of patterns in the figure below can well reflect this point.</p>
<p>Therefore, in interface design, we often use the principle of proximity to distinguish large functional modules, and then use color similarity to distinguish states (such as selected states, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F733b24aa-7ffd-4713-a5de-abcda2fd25a2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;733b24aa-7ffd-4713-a5de-abcda2fd25a2.png"></p>

<h2 id="Application-of-Similarity-Principle-and-Proximity-Principle"><a href="#Application-of-Similarity-Principle-and-Proximity-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Application of Similarity Principle and Proximity Principle"></a>Application of Similarity Principle and Proximity Principle</h2><p>In practical applications, similarity and proximity are usually used together.</p>
<p>The simplest principles are often the most powerful and useful. Similarity and proximity are widely used in various UI designs.</p>
<h3 id="①-Control-Layout"><a href="#①-Control-Layout" class="headerlink" title="① Control Layout"></a>① Control Layout</h3><p>The navigation bar, which is used by almost all apps, contains the principles of similarity and proximity.</p>
<p>Take the navigation bar of the “NetEase OA” app as an example.</p>
<p>The form and size of each group of tabs are similar, and users can easily identify that they belong to the same functional module.</p>
<p>At the same time, the color of the selected tab is different, highlighting its different state (this is also the reason why we often use color to represent special states such as selected states).</p>
<p>And when we analyze these, we actually default that these are five groups of elements.</p>
<p>Although the similarity between the icon and the text is very low, because they are close enough, we will default that they are a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2Fba3c7457-a538-4307-a720-5e3995af15ef.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;ba3c7457-a538-4307-a720-5e3995af15ef.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The control layout of the navigation bar cleverly uses Gestalt principles</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="②-Functional-Partitioning"><a href="#②-Functional-Partitioning" class="headerlink" title="② Functional Partitioning"></a>② Functional Partitioning</h3><p>In game interface design, proximity and similarity are also very important.</p>
<p>Because a game interface often contains multiple functional modules, proximity can help us perform functional partitioning.</p>
<p>For example, the deployment interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>.</p>
<p>We will separate different functional modules, so that the functional division of the entire interface is very obvious.</p>
<p>The most important deploy button is separated from other functional blocks, and the prominent size and color are used to make it easier for players to notice the button.</p>
<p>In the same functional module, such as the densely arranged information area on the left, the distance between rows is also separated to clarify that each row is the information of the same player.</p>
<p>At the same time, the similar icon forms and arrangement positions make it easier for players to identify similar information and compare information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F0e37126d-ca04-4c5f-b79a-86f80c88ba87.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;0e37126d-ca04-4c5f-b79a-86f80c88ba87.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Gestalt principles help with functional partitioning within the game interface</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="③-Information-Clustering"><a href="#③-Information-Clustering" class="headerlink" title="③ Information Clustering"></a>③ Information Clustering</h3><p>The principles of proximity and similarity can also help us cluster information and show the differences and connections between large amounts of information.</p>
<p>For example, the Soul interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> contains a lot of grid and icon information, which uses the distance between different grids for clustering.</p>
<p>At the same time, size similarity is used to enhance the distinction. The larger ones in the middle are the installation slots, and the two sides are the Soul libraries.</p>
<p>The principle of symmetry is also implied here. The symmetrical form will make people feel more comfortable and holistic.</p>
<p>In addition, the background pattern of the installed Soul and the background pattern of the slot are the same, which builds a connection between them through shape similarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F7c730e65-9745-462c-8e11-077feea9d928.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;7c730e65-9745-462c-8e11-077feea9d928.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Using Gestalt principles can show the differences and connections between large amounts of information</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="④-Use-Containers"><a href="#④-Use-Containers" class="headerlink" title="④ Use Containers"></a>④ Use Containers</h3><p>Sometimes there is too much information in the same interface, and there is no space to separate them.</p>
<p>In this case, in addition to using distance for clustering, we can also use “containers” to frame the same group of information in one area.</p>
<p>The container can be a background or a line.</p>
<p>For example, the tournament interface of <em>UNO!</em> needs to accommodate a large amount of information. In order to be able to clearly classify and display this information, we use different backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition, the score panel here uses the principle of proximity to separate “Classic Single Player” and “Fun Single Player”.</p>
<p>Color similarity is used to distinguish between positive and negative score levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210331%2F5971fd26-1976-4b8e-911d-fe90307c2fbb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210331&#x2F;5971fd26-1976-4b8e-911d-fe90307c2fbb.png"></p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210401/28584_940140.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Gestalt principles are a fundamental theory in design and have been widely used in many aspects of visual design and interaction design.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Gestalt theory and how it can make design easier.</p>
<p>Gestalt principles include several principles. Here we mainly share four of them: similarity, proximity, closure, and continuity.</p>

<p>The previous article has introduced the principles of similarity and proximity. This article will continue to explain the principles of closure and continuity.</p>

<p>As shown in the figure below, we usually think there is 1 circle and 1 point, not 9 points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F9cb6cb6e-92c8-43f5-9817-b8c735365efb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;9cb6cb6e-92c8-43f5-9817-b8c735365efb.png"></p>
<blockquote>

<p>There are three types of closure: shape closure, negative space closure, and experiential closure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Fa92a7d4d-43e2-489e-93cd-57b9d1285268.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;a92a7d4d-43e2-489e-93cd-57b9d1285268.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three Types of Closure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very classic example can illustrate both shape closure and negative shape closure.</p>
<p>In the figure below, we can identify two triangles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Fbfc3631b-7b38-48c3-a753-699647a9ec8e.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;bfc3631b-7b38-48c3-a753-699647a9ec8e.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two triangles can be seen in the figure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connecting the black borders, the resulting triangle is shape closure.</p>
<p>Connecting the outlines of the three black circle depressions, the resulting white triangle is negative shape closure.</p>
<p>Experiential closure, to a certain extent, relies on people’s existing experience, as detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="②-Application-of-the-Principle-of-Closure"><a href="#②-Application-of-the-Principle-of-Closure" class="headerlink" title="② Application of the Principle of Closure"></a>② Application of the Principle of Closure</h3><p>The principle of closure is often used in visual design to increase the sense of variety.</p>
<p>Applying the principle of closure in interaction design can express more information with fewer elements, making the interface content simple and not redundant.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Truncation Design</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Truncation design, which is very frequently used in UI design, is based on the principle of closure.</p>
<p>How can we let users know that a list is scrollable?</p>
<p>For example, the list interface of “UNO!” adopts two methods - truncation and paging controls.</p>
<p>At the end of the list, a part is truncated. Because of closure, we will naturally imagine a complete whole below through the remaining part, so we know that we can slide down to view.</p>
<p>In many cases, this method can reduce the use of controls and reduce the burden of interface layout.</p>
<p>And the three-level tabs here, because of their small area, using controls can better attract users’ attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Fa92dac3b-cc3e-486d-9e3d-62a02a63b982.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;a92dac3b-cc3e-486d-9e3d-62a02a63b982.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list interface of “UNO!” uses truncation and paging controls</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Whitespace Implication</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Closure can also help us with cognition in some cases.</p>
<p>Clever use of whitespace will not affect our cognition, but can add more possibilities to the design.</p>
<p>For example, the game <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em> uses only a very small part of the arc to represent an entire planet, reducing the burden of the picture while having a sense of mystery waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F663be568-9498-44ce-904b-355c5fa6743e.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;663be568-9498-44ce-904b-355c5fa6743e.gif"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Experiential Closure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The common tab design is a form of experiential closure.</p>
<p>The older tab design used a very realistic and complete closure form, similar to the tabs of a notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F746cfccd-ca93-4421-9112-8cd6b2fe4b2b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;746cfccd-ca93-4421-9112-8cd6b2fe4b2b.png"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>With the evolution of the visual style of the Internet, people have experience in using the Internet, so simplifying it to the form of only one line can also make users understand the selected state.</p>
<p>People will naturally regard the tab and the corresponding content below as a closed whole through their own experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F64d8c8b3-6137-434f-85b1-3168437f095d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;64d8c8b3-6137-434f-85b1-3168437f095d.png"></p>

<p>Human vision tends to perceive continuous forms in order to connect elements together, rather than scattered fragments.</p>
<p>For example, the dots in the figure below will be seen as lines bending in two directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Ff88c3a9e-5e8f-4f6d-be7e-f841c2f1d861.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;f88c3a9e-5e8f-4f6d-be7e-f841c2f1d861.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will see the dots in the picture as lines bending in two directions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared with the principle of closure, continuity emphasizes the guidance of direction, rather than beginning and end.</p>
<p>If some parts of a graphic can be seen as connected together, it is also easy to be seen as a whole.</p>
<p>By finding very small commonalities, we can connect two different elements into a whole.</p>
<p>For example, the letter H and the leaf in the figure below are two completely different graphics.</p>
<p>But even so, it can still be connected into a whole through curves and leaf veins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Fecd09052-0c32-407b-bf61-ee4f84971fe4.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;ecd09052-0c32-407b-bf61-ee4f84971fe4.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="②-Application-of-the-Principle-of-Continuity"><a href="#②-Application-of-the-Principle-of-Continuity" class="headerlink" title="② Application of the Principle of Continuity"></a>② Application of the Principle of Continuity</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Visual Guidance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Around the World mode of “UNO!” is a basic application case of the principle of continuity.</p>
<p>The icons of each chapter are arranged continuously. It is obvious that they are extending backwards and can be slid backwards.</p>
<p>Without the arrangement of these icons, we might just think it is a static landscape picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F347e0518-d2d3-4a8e-9df9-ef535c5aed1c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;347e0518-d2d3-4a8e-9df9-ef535c5aed1c.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The arrangement of icons in the Around the World mode in “UNO!” adopts the principle of continuity</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Establish Connections</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Continuity can also help us establish connections to different UI elements.</p>
<p>For example, the personal goal interface of “UNO!”.</p>
<p>When we complete the task on the right, there will be an animation of a badge flying to the progress bar on the left.</p>
<p>This form can very clearly let users know that the increase in the progress bar on the left is composed of completing the tasks on the right. Clarify the connection between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F39442dde-63da-4681-be46-accbd7cf23ff.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;39442dde-63da-4681-be46-accbd7cf23ff.gif"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuity helps different UI elements establish connections</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Form a Whole</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Continuity can also help us form a whole.</p>
<p>Take McDonald’s two coffee posters as an example.</p>
<p>The coffees on the left are arranged continuously one after another, which will guide our sight to look down one by one.</p>
<p>And it also integrates the principle of closure, making them look like a cup of coffee as a whole.</p>
<p>The picture on the right is an arc-shaped arrangement, forming a feeling of C, which is the first letter C of coffee.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Space Construction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes continuity can also construct some invisible lines, and these invisible lines can help us create a sense of space.</p>
<p>For example, the poster of “Call of Juarez: The Cartel”.</p>
<p>The guns of these people are pointing at others in a staggered manner, which will give us a feeling of lines crossing in space.</p>
<p>This can very well increase the sense of space and dramatic conflict of this static poster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2Ffb6c5f27-8abe-4ae7-8547-dacbdb5f3664.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210401&#x2F;fb6c5f27-8abe-4ae7-8547-dacbdb5f3664.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle of continuity constructs “invisible lines” and creates a sense of space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes in UI design, we can also use the orderly arrangement between elements to construct some invisible lines.</p>
<p>For example, the figure below is a concept design drawing of “Anthem”.</p>
<p>No borders or backplanes are used here.</p>
<p>Instead, it relies only on the alignment and continuous arrangement of text elements to form invisible lines.</p>
<p>This outlines the effect of 3D UI, which is very spatial and futuristic.</p>
<p>It also helps us focus our sight on the image in the middle.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In addition to the four principles shared above, Gestalt principles also include simplicity, symmetry, common fate, experience principles, etc., and also have a wide range of applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210401%2F8fc51b75-b626-48de-8109-c72edba05634.png/size/" alt="Many Principles of Gestalt"></p>
<p>As a basic design theory, Gestalt’s principles are actually very simple, and have been applied in many designs.</p>
<p>So why do we still need to understand these?</p>
<p>In many cases, we judge what kind of design is reasonable based on our own experience, but we cannot say the reason for this design.</p>
<p>Gestalt theory can provide a basis and guidance for our design, and give us a thinking framework;</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also provides a basis for us to elaborate and explain our own solutions, making our solutions appear more reasonable.</p>

    <title>Consistency Principle and Game Design (Part 1)</title>
    <url>/2020/08/11/netease-ux-articles/news_20210420_28584_943139/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210420/28584_943139.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The direction of escalators in shopping malls is always consistent. It will not be the case that the escalator on the first floor is up on the left and down on the right, while on the second floor it is up on the right and down on the left.</p>
<p>Imagine how much inconvenience it would cause people if the escalators going up from the first floor to the fourth floor were all on the left, while the one on the fifth floor was on the right?</p>
<p>This reflects the consistency principle.</p>
<h2 id="The-Consistency-Principle-and-Its-Importance"><a href="#The-Consistency-Principle-and-Its-Importance" class="headerlink" title="The Consistency Principle and Its Importance"></a>The Consistency Principle and Its Importance</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Consistency Principle?"></a>1. What is the Consistency Principle?</h3><p>Within the same product, the navigation methods, naming methods for the same functions, visual presentation of similar elements, and interaction rules for operational behaviors should be consistent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the product should also be consistent with common industry standards.</p>
<p>The consistency principle is ubiquitous in life and is also widely used in the field of game design.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Importance-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#2-The-Importance-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="2. The Importance of the Consistency Principle"></a>2. The Importance of the Consistency Principle</h3><p>For players, the consistency of interfaces and functions can greatly reduce the learning cost for players.</p>
<p>When players are familiar with the basic operations, they can quickly learn other systems and gameplay, reducing the sense of interruption for players in the game, thereby improving the player’s operational efficiency.</p>
<p>There are many games where we can “blindly operate” after our operational proficiency improves, and even form muscle memory, allowing us to enjoy the exciting battles in the game.</p>
<p>For developers, the consistency of the interface allows many art resources to be reused.</p>
<p>For example, the consistent style of buttons in the game allows designers to quickly reuse them without having to redesign them for each interface.</p>
<p>The same is true for programmers. The same functions can also be directly reused, reducing development costs.</p>
<p>In addition, consistency can help the game maintain a consistent style and form the game’s unique style and impression.</p>
<p>Moreover, for newcomers, they can quickly get started with the project according to development or design specifications, reducing learning costs.</p>
<p>The consistency principle is reflected in many aspects of design.</p>
<p>This article mainly divides it into four parts for introduction: visual consistency, text consistency, functional consistency, and special effects consistency.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Application of the Consistency Principle"></a>Application of the Consistency Principle</h2><h3 id="1-Visual-Consistency"><a href="#1-Visual-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="1. Visual Consistency"></a>1. Visual Consistency</h3><p>Visual consistency is mainly reflected in the consistency of visual style and visual elements.</p>
<p>Here’s a concise example:</p>
<p>The following two games have a strong difference in visual style.</p>
<p>The cold gray atmosphere of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> is embellished with bright red, rendering a strong sense of war epic and history.</p>
<p>The high-purity colors of <em>UNO!</em> are cheerful, lively, and bright.</p>
<p>Each game has its own unique visual style, and when designing, it is also necessary to comply with the style attributes of the project itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2Ff3f3beee-22a6-482f-8591-be84ae4ad2da.jpg/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade Screenshot"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F1f620338-692b-459a-a11f-38b2781f6193.png/size/" alt="UNO Screenshot"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different games have different visual styles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consistency also needs to be considered in the details of visual presentation.</p>
<p>For example, we often use red and blue colors in games to represent conflicting sides.</p>
<p>Sometimes blue represents the friendly side and red represents the enemy side; sometimes blue represents defense and red represents attack.</p>
<p>In the design of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, there is a gameplay where two sides duel in the world, and other players can also join the battle. When joining, they need to choose a faction.</p>
<p>At this time, it is natural to think of using the red and blue colors of the duel to represent the two factions in the battle.</p>
<p>So the question is, what should the semantics of red and blue be?</p>
<p>The simplest solution is that red represents attack, but is it really appropriate?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F54ae6e08-a74a-44b6-bbc7-224b7d9b7635.png/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade World Pursuit Battle Interface"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> World Pursuit Battle participation interface, red and blue represent enemy and friend, not attack and defense</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this problem, after re-examining the game, it was found that in the core battles of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, red and blue always represent the friendly side and the enemy side, and have nothing to do with attack and defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was finally decided to maintain the consistency of color semantics, with blue representing the friendly side and red representing the enemy side.</p>
<p>So how do you determine the enemy and friend?</p>
<p>We have specially designed a set of calculation methods, which compare the initiator of the two sides of the battle with the player based on elements such as family relationships.</p>
<p>The relatively friendly side is placed on the left as the blue side, and the other side is on the right.</p>
<p>If the degree of friendship is the same, the blue side on the left is the defending side. After all, the pursued side should be more protected and supported.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F0fe2e090-52bd-463e-b332-52137856fb3f.jpg/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade Screenshot"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F2b5a5372-01e4-4393-b5d6-017a9f029139.jpg/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade Screenshot"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In game design, it is necessary to maintain the consistency of color semantics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the font size, spacing, and positional relationship of the text in the game also need to be consistent.</p>
<p>We often set several font sizes for the game at the beginning of the design, which are used for titles, subtitles, and body text, respectively.</p>
<p>In most cases, the default font size and spacing will be used to ensure visual consistency, making it easier for players to quickly locate the information they want to know.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2Fc3d8eac5-4f29-44c5-903f-12d9303c17a9.png/size/" alt="Font Example"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Font size, spacing, and positional relationships need to be consistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the size relationship of elements also needs to be consistent.</p>
<p>This is mainly reflected in the use of icons and some materials in the game.</p>
<p>For example, at the beginning of the design, the size and style of the “unit cards” of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em> lacked consistency. The position and proportion of the characters in the cards were different, and other elements were not kept in the same position and relative size.</p>
<p>After the later optimization, the size of the cards was clustered, and the overall visual feeling was more consistent, making it easier for players to form image memory and improve the player experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F2e7e1b9c-4012-4378-964a-58f63f36ede4.png/size/" alt="Inconsistent Unit Card Example"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210420%2F92a67966-b8c1-42ef-b518-a5e5b09c4245.png/size/" alt="Consistent Unit Card Example"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-Text-Consistency"><a href="#2-Text-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Text Consistency"></a>2. Text Consistency</h3><p>The style and semantic expression of the text also need to be consistent.</p>
<p>For example, the feedback pop-up window for errors should use the same language and structure when describing the same thing, otherwise it will cause players to pay higher reading comprehension costs.</p>
<p>For example, the text on the confirmation button cannot be called “OK” at one time, “Confirm” at another time, and “Got it” at another time, otherwise the player will have to react to the meaning of the button every time, causing a pause in the experience.</p>
<p>This unnecessary burden and pause are very unnecessary.</p>
<p>However, because this kind of pop-up window is spread all over the game, omissions and occasional inconsistencies often occur. More care and attention must be paid during the design.</p>

    <title>The Consistency Principle and Game Design (Part 2)</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210422/28584_943577.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Within the same product, the navigation methods, the naming of identical functions, the visual presentation of similar elements, and the interaction principles of operational behaviors should maintain consistency.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the product should also maintain consistency with common industry standards.</p>
<p>This is the Consistency Principle.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle"><a href="#Application-of-the-Consistency-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Application of the Consistency Principle"></a>Application of the Consistency Principle</h2><p>The Consistency Principle is ubiquitous in daily life and is also widely applied in the field of game design.</p>
<p>This article mainly divides it into four parts for introduction: visual consistency, text consistency, functional consistency, and special effects consistency.</p>
<p>The previous article has already introduced visual consistency and text consistency. This article will continue to explain functional consistency and special effects consistency.</p>
<h3 id="1-Functional-Consistency"><a href="#1-Functional-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="1. Functional Consistency"></a>1. Functional Consistency</h3><p><strong>(1) Position</strong></p>
<p>In games, key bindings are the premise of all operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, key prompts are crucial for novice players, helping them quickly get through the novice period.</p>
<p>The figure below shows two key prompts in <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>.</p>
<p>The prompt order for skill releases of “QERT” is exactly the same as the key bindings, which players can quickly learn;</p>
<p>However, the prompt for the unit operation keys of “XCV” is a bit “awkward”.</p>
<p>Not only are the horizontal keys not displayed horizontally, but the order is also reversed.</p>
<p>Players need to repeatedly confirm the operation and the position of the keys during learning, which increases the learning cost.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2Fbd4959f4-19e3-4bd6-a0bb-316fb65065c4.png/size/" alt="Conqueror&#39;s Blade key prompts and their correspondence to the keyboard"></p>
<p>In addition to the correspondence of key bindings, the position of identical elements in different interfaces should also be as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s take the position of the simplest and most basic “close button” as an example:</p>
<p>Generally, the position of the close button in the same game is the same. If one of them suddenly changes position, it will be difficult for the player to find this close button.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the deployment interface and the unit formation interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>.</p>
<p>One is to select soldiers to deploy for battle, and the other is to preset the combination of soldiers to deploy in advance, which is a bit like a deck-building system.</p>
<p>In the design, considering the user’s habits, try to unify the operation area for selecting soldiers in the same position.</p>
<p>In this way, players only need to learn one system and they will be “familiar at first sight” with the other system, making it easier to get started without additional learning costs.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2Fd7d14cfa-97ab-42bf-8ec5-3f55ee59d811.png/size/" alt="Selection Area"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>The soldier selection operation positions of the deployment and unit formation interfaces in “Conqueror’s Blade” are consistent</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(2) Interaction Method</strong></p>
<p>Taking PC games as an example, mouse operations mainly include left-click, double-click, drag, right-click, and middle scroll.</p>
<p>These operations should also be kept as consistent as possible in the selection.</p>
<p>For example, in the armory (warehouse) interface of <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, players mainly use right-click and left-click drag to transfer items.</p>
<p>Therefore, the operation of disassembling and assembling the abilities of the unit’s soul also follows the operation of right-click and left-click drag, ensuring the consistency of operation, so that players do not need to repeatedly memorize two sets of operating logic.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2Fcb679717-08d7-4a4d-924a-0b14011956d0.gif/size/" alt="Right-click and drag"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F3bb65f29-4fa3-483f-ba60-5119f479ba3b.gif/size/" alt="Left-click and Drag"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The armory interface and the unit soul installation interface of “Conqueror’s Blade” use similar operating methods</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-Special-Effects-Consistency"><a href="#2-Special-Effects-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Special Effects Consistency"></a>2. Special Effects Consistency</h3><p>It is often said that Apple phones seem to be smoother than Android phones, and Android phones always lag.</p>
<p>This is because the animation design of each app on Android is different, which gives people a feeling of fluctuating speed.</p>
<p>In contrast, slower animations seem to have slower loading speeds.</p>
<p>The iOS system is relatively more unified, so users will feel more comfortable and smooth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the design of the game, for common animations, we should also establish a general animation library and animation specifications to ensure the unity and consistency of sound, animation, and special effects.</p>
<p>The figure below is the basic animation document of <em>UNO!</em>, which is convenient for quick search and reuse during design.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F78a9e364-9c60-4c4f-bc13-cef70b2cfffa.jpg/size/" alt="Basic Animation Doc"></p>

<p><em>Basic animation document of “UNO!”</em></p>

<h3 id="3-Inconsistency"><a href="#3-Inconsistency" class="headerlink" title="3. Inconsistency"></a>3. Inconsistency</h3><p>The Consistency Principle does not always bring positive effects and a comfortable experience in all situations.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of this article, let’s talk about “inconsistency”.</p>
<p>Inconsistency is actually a dialectical way of using consistency.</p>
<p>Simply put, we make the same thing as consistent as possible, but two different things or similar things are made very “inconsistent” to help players distinguish and prompt.</p>
<p>For example, when buying items in the store, buying for yourself and buying for others seem to be the same purchase behavior, but they are actually different.</p>
<p>At this time, it is necessary to deliberately make the two “purchase” buttons very different to remind players that these two choices are different.</p>
<p>By making similar but different elements inconsistent in design, the consistency of the design is further highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210422%2F6ad57c3e-202f-435c-9d3d-7b8ef70c2271.png/size/" alt="Purchase VS Gifting"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Conqueror’s Blade》 store purchase and gifting pop-up window</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, we can also create surprises for players through inconsistency.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Conqueror’s Blade</em>, most of the system interfaces are in shades of gray and black.</p>
<p>Then, in the optimized design of the unit soul system, which is the main feature of the latest season, a very bright color representing the unit’s quality is used as the background, giving players a refreshing feeling;</p>
<p>At the same time, colors are also used to help players classify the categories and qualities of units.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Consistency is a very basic principle and method in design, and it is also a way of classifying and recognizing the world and processing complex information. It is very important for every designer and needs to be implemented throughout.</p>
<p>But it is a tool, not a shackle. It should not be followed rigidly during use, but the Consistency Principle should be viewed with a progressive eye, and it should be balanced and updated.</p>
<p>For example, design specifications should also be updated simultaneously as the design progresses, otherwise the guiding significance of the specifications will be lost.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also possible to appropriately jump out of the norms and make certain innovations and breakthroughs, otherwise it is easy to make players feel boring and monotonous.</p>
<p>Under the condition of local unity, seek common ground while reserving differences, and make continuous progress.</p>

    <title>Interest Curves and Game Novice Guides (Part 1)</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210510/28584_946545.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interest curve was proposed by Jesse Schell in <em>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>.</p>
<p>In games, movies, or performances, interest curves are often used to record the changes in audience or player interest over time.</p>
<p>The novice guide of a game, in addition to letting players understand the basic rules of the game, is also the “face” of a game to attract new players’ interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can start from the perspective of the interest curve to analyze how to make the game novice guide quickly capture the player’s heart in a short time.</p>
<p><strong>01 The Concept of the Interest Curve</strong></p>
<p>We use the horizontal axis of the coordinate system to represent time and the vertical axis to represent the degree of interest.</p>
<p>According to Jesse’s theory, a good interest curve template will show the following form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2Fdd3b0725-dacc-41b5-9c30-b068316444d0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;dd3b0725-dacc-41b5-9c30-b068316444d0.png"></p>
<p><em>Example of a good interest curve in “The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses”</em></p>
<p>The degree of interest at point A represents people’s first impression of a segment, which is often influenced by rumors, advertisements, and other pre-promotion.</p>
<p>It quickly reaches point B.</p>
<p>Point B, as an exciting “hook” for the audience, gives the audience a happy signal and makes the audience look forward to the next paragraph.</p>
<p>After point B, the audience’s emotions gradually stabilize, and at point C, it reaches the peak of a paragraph.</p>
<p>The stability of point D then sets the stage for the next peak at point E.</p>
<p>At point F, it enters a gentle transition period again.</p>
<p>Finally, it reaches point G, reaching the climax of the entire segment, and ends the entire segment at point H.</p>
<p>As shown below, Jesse also mentioned two examples of interest curves that need to be improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F3771d065-8a72-401f-b652-35dd2eb7d52c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;3771d065-8a72-401f-b652-35dd2eb7d52c.png"></p>
<p><em>Two examples of less-than-ideal interest curves</em></p>
<p>In Figure A, the highest point of interest does not appear at the end of the segment, which will give the audience a feeling of anticlimax.</p>
<p>In Figure B, there is a long period of dullness between two points of interest, which may easily cause the loss of audience or players during this process.</p>
<p><strong>02 Examples of the Application of Interest Curves</strong></p>
<p>Similar application cases of interest curves can be found in many works of art.</p>
<p>Let’s take the performance of “Big Bowl Thick Noodle” in the variety show “Sisters Who Make Waves” as an example:</p>
<p>There are 4 sections of opera singing in the whole performance, all of which are highlights.</p>
<p>If we arrange them according to the timeline, we can get the following interest curve:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F0197fc9d-8ec1-4398-a38c-5df01753beb8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;0197fc9d-8ec1-4398-a38c-5df01753beb8.png"></p>
<p><em>The distribution of opera singing and the interest curve of “Big Bowl Thick Noodle (Sister Lang Version)”</em></p>
<p>At the beginning of the performance, Yu Kewei’s opera singing opening suddenly raised the audience’s expectations.</p>
<p>Then the two sections of opera singing by Zhang Hanyun are also the focus of everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, it is still Yu Kewei’s singing, accompanied by the chorus of other sisters, pushing the entire performance to the highest climax.</p>
<p>Similarly, this curve is also applied in many three-act movies, such as “The Shawshank Redemption”.</p>
<p>In the cause, process, and result stages of the movie, we can all see several plots that can stimulate the audience’s strong interest.</p>
<p>It is under the continuous advancement of “foreshadowing-climax-foreshadowing-climax-…” that the audience’s attention can closely follow the fate of the protagonist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F89c93397-a3b2-4fa0-8d0c-c6e45d50d6b5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;89c93397-a3b2-4fa0-8d0c-c6e45d50d6b5.png"></p>
<p><em>The plot interest curve of the movie “The Shawshank Redemption”</em></p>
<p><strong>03 The Composition of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Since we want to arouse interest, we must understand what constitutes interest.</p>
<p>In “The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses”, three main components of interest are mentioned:</p>
<p>(1) Inherent interest</p>
<p>Adventure, fantasy, specials, and reward mechanisms are inherently interesting.</p>
<p>(2) Artistic expression</p>
<p>That is, aesthetics in the game.</p>
<p>(3) Immersion</p>
<p>When players have a strong empathy for the tasks in the game, interest also arises.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about these three constituent points in detail with specific examples in the game.</p>
<p><strong>1. Inherent Interest</strong></p>
<p>In “Uncharted: The Lost Legacy”, the protagonist needs to go through a series of level challenges.</p>
<p>For example, jumping with the help of billboards, lurking with the help of cover, sliding on tall buildings, etc.</p>
<p>A certain degree of difficulty and thrilling pictures are already interesting enough for players.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be some calm and soothing passages between several levels, such as the dialogue between two characters, to avoid the appearance of interest points being too dense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F9aeca807-bed9-4c3a-a17c-45860b28e658.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;9aeca807-bed9-4c3a-a17c-45860b28e658.gif"></p>
<p><em>In “Uncharted: The Lost Legacy”, the protagonist jumps between billboards</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F7f22e396-0d89-414d-a7c5-78210339b2d4.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;7f22e396-0d89-414d-a7c5-78210339b2d4.gif"></p>
<p><em>In “Uncharted: The Lost Legacy”, the protagonist jumps onto the high wall and slides on the electric wire</em></p>
<p>In “Luigi’s Mansion”, a series of fright events and novel and fun interactive methods also give players a very strong interest.</p>
<p>While the player thinks the game is fun, they also memorize the game operation of using the flashlight to shine around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F6ed1a12b-2413-4693-b89c-876cc1d1517e.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;6ed1a12b-2413-4693-b89c-876cc1d1517e.gif"></p>
<p><em>In “Luigi’s Mansion”, Luigi opens the closet and is scared by the bouncing toy</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F037d1ed9-7277-44c9-a32b-e00ded0c2415.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;037d1ed9-7277-44c9-a32b-e00ded0c2415.gif"></p>
<p><em>In “Luigi’s Mansion”, the combination of vacuum cleaner and flashlight can pull objects closer or push them away</em></p>
<p>In the novice tutorial of “UNO Together”, the player narrowly defeats the system opponent with the advantage of one card.</p>
<p>This arrangement greatly stimulates the player’s interest in the game and gives the player a deeper impression of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210510%2F31dd3013-504b-4eb8-bc33-ce3edb579ed7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210510&#x2F;31dd3013-504b-4eb8-bc33-ce3edb579ed7.png"></p>
<p><em>The opponent has also called UNO, but the player still wins</em></p>
<p>Artistic expression, immersion, and analysis of the application of interest curves in novice guidance will be detailed in the next article.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210511/28584_946848.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Interest Curve was proposed by Jesse Schell in his book <em>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>.</p>
<p>In games, movies, or performances, interest curves are often used to record how the audience’s or player’s interest changes over time.</p>
<p>And the game’s novice tutorial, in addition to allowing players to understand the basic rules of the game, is also the “face” of a game to attract new players’ interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can analyze how to make the game novice guide quickly capture the player’s heart in a short time from the perspective of the interest curve.</p>
<h2 id="01-The-Composition-of-Interest"><a href="#01-The-Composition-of-Interest" class="headerlink" title="01. The Composition of Interest"></a>01. The Composition of Interest</h2><p>In <em>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</em>, three main parts that make up interest are mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Inherent Interest</strong></p>
<p>Adventure, fantasy, uniqueness, and the reward mechanism itself are all interests.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Artistic Expression</strong></p>
<p>That is, the aesthetics in the game.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Sense of Immersion</strong></p>
<p>When players have a strong empathy for the tasks in the game, interest also arises.</p>
<p>In the previous article, we have already understood “Inherent Interest”;</p>
<p>Below we will continue to introduce the other two main components of interest - artistic expression and the sense of immersion.</p>
<h3 id="1-Artistic-Expression"><a href="#1-Artistic-Expression" class="headerlink" title="1. Artistic Expression"></a>1. Artistic Expression</h3><p>The aesthetics in the game are usually reflected in exquisite graphics, eye-catching special effects, excellent camera language, beautiful music, and cute little details.</p>
<p>These aesthetic enjoyments can also bring certain spiritual stimulation to players.</p>
<p>Taking the game <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em> as an example, it firmly grasps the player’s heart in the early stage of the plot with its highly recognizable art style and excellent camera narrative method.</p>
<p><strong>Cute Animation</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning, Ori, the child of the Spirit Tree, falls into the forest and is picked up and adopted by the mother beast Naru.</p>
<p>The scene where Naru gently holds Ori in her arms is particularly warm in a dark storm.</p>
<p>In this way, the audience is brought to the first emotional high point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Fde8febb3-cd68-439a-a311-7543b3328f50.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;de8febb3-cd68-439a-a311-7543b3328f50.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Naru found Ori and held Ori in her arms</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ingenious Details</strong></p>
<p>Naru takes Ori out to find food and makes a mark on the tree that has been picked.</p>
<p>This kind of small and clever detail, which is relatively secondary to the plot but can give the audience a knowing blow, is often very moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Fa4d55557-859a-4a9b-9139-41d8cadffc15.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;a4d55557-859a-4a9b-9139-41d8cadffc15.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Naru takes Ori out for food and draws a small cross on the tree that has been picked</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Excellent Camera Language</strong></p>
<p>In the next paragraph, the Spirit Tree is severely damaged, and the entire picture darkens.</p>
<p>In the process of Ori going out to find food for the exhausted Naru, the shadows of the past reappear one by one at the location at that time.</p>
<p>This scene further intensifies the player’s emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F3fcfd515-f082-450f-8a79-db05260bf462.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;3fcfd515-f082-450f-8a79-db05260bf462.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ori goes out to find food for the exhausted Naru, and the past emerges</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It should be noted here that low emotion does not mean low interest.</p>
<p>When the player’s emotions follow the game’s sadness or anger, it is often the peak of interest.</p>
<p><strong>The Use of Light, Shadow and Tone</strong></p>
<p>In the above scenes, we can clearly feel the changes in tone, light, and shadow in the three clips.</p>
<p>The quiet blue, the bright yellow-green, and the terrible dark red make the scene atmosphere very prominent.</p>
<p>In addition, Ori and Naru are always the brightest presence in the picture, allowing the audience to clearly focus their vision.</p>
<h3 id="2-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#2-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="2. Sense of Immersion"></a>2. Sense of Immersion</h3><p>When players empathize with the protagonist of the game, they will naturally have a strong interest in the fate of the protagonist.</p>
<p>Jesse mentioned that when players first come into contact with the game, the protagonist is a stranger to them;</p>
<p>If a good sense of immersion can be achieved later, the player will treat the protagonist as their friend, and even eventually bring it into themselves and empathize.</p>
<p>The game <em>Florence</em> does a very good job in terms of “sense of immersion”.</p>
<p>First of all, the game uses a plot that is highly consistent with the real life of most players.</p>
<p>Such a plot itself will give players a feeling of “you have me, I have you”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F896443e4-87dd-4be1-b21b-1e5433ceae66.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;896443e4-87dd-4be1-b21b-1e5433ceae66.gif"><br>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F5e3241fb-2430-4504-8525-b24974ea28f5.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;5e3241fb-2430-4504-8525-b24974ea28f5.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Florence’s growth process</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the same time, immersive interaction can also make players empathize.</p>
<p>When Florence has problems with her boyfriend’s relationship, the player wants to put together puzzles and photos from Florence’s perspective.</p>
<p>When starting to put the puzzle together, the player will think that the two protagonists should sleep facing each other;</p>
<p>But after putting it together, it is found that the two are not only back to back, but also have irreparable cracks in the middle.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the player tries to put the photo together, the photo keeps drifting away, which can evoke the player’s inner melancholy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F64f93cb5-ec43-4a50-a875-6d5f61c18d8b.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;64f93cb5-ec43-4a50-a875-6d5f61c18d8b.gif"><br>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Fbd4851b1-8ee2-49a9-9468-47f01c80d148.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;bd4851b1-8ee2-49a9-9468-47f01c80d148.gif"></p>

<p><em>Players can no longer repair the relationship between Florence and her boyfriend</em></p>

<h2 id="02-The-Embodiment-of-Interest-Curve-in-Novice-Tutorials"><a href="#02-The-Embodiment-of-Interest-Curve-in-Novice-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="02. The Embodiment of Interest Curve in Novice Tutorials"></a>02. The Embodiment of Interest Curve in Novice Tutorials</h2><p>We can use the above three key points that make up interest to analyze the interest curve of a novice tutorial.</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> is a game that does a very good job in novice tutorials.</p>
<p>We measure its interest points from the three perspectives of inherent interest, sense of immersion, and aesthetics, and we can get the following curve:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2Ff88d46d4-875b-47fc-b324-4a03b9cbeb7b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;f88d46d4-875b-47fc-b324-4a03b9cbeb7b.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The interest curve of “Super Mario: Odyssey” in the novice tutorial stage</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The first peak point appears in the plot animation - Mario’s hat is trampled and torn by the boss.</p>
<p>The player’s interest is composed of the smoothness of the animation and the plot itself.</p>
<p>At the second peak - the hat ghost becomes Mario’s red hat, and the player shakes the switch handle to throw the hat forward.</p>
<p>The cute and immediate feedback and the near-real physical interaction make the game very interesting.</p>
<p>After the operation practice of Mario possessing the frog, it finally comes to the climax of the novice level - fighting the small boss.</p>
<p>The funny animation and challenging level design also push the player’s interest to the highest point.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also see a similar curve in <em>UNO</em>.</p>
<p>Animation, preliminary rule guidance, and the final stage of actual combat drills constitute the nodes in the novice tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210511%2F898d748e-2066-4c0b-8b86-f52957b3f973.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20210511&#x2F;898d748e-2066-4c0b-8b86-f52957b3f973.png"></p>

<h2 id="03-The-Inspiration-of-Interest-Curve-to-Game-Novice-Tutorials"><a href="#03-The-Inspiration-of-Interest-Curve-to-Game-Novice-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="03. The Inspiration of Interest Curve to Game Novice Tutorials"></a>03. The Inspiration of Interest Curve to Game Novice Tutorials</h2><p>Through the analysis of the above content, we can summarize that the interest curve provides the following three new thinking directions for analyzing the rationality of novice tutorials:</p>
<p>① Designers can analyze whether the setting of interest points of the novice tutorial on the timeline is reasonable from the time point, whether there is a long dull period that is likely to cause churn, or whether the setting time of the peak of interest is reasonable.</p>
<p>② We need to think about more directions that can be tried from the three constituent elements of inherent interest points, artistry, and sense of immersion, so as to make the interest curve better.</p>
<p>③ Understanding the composition of interest is also of reference significance to interaction designers:</p>
<p>   Novel and fun interactions can touch players;</p>
<p>   At the same time, immersive interaction can allow players to improve their understanding of the game and game characters in the process of interacting with each other.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20210518/28584_948505.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>There are many kinds of mechanical elements in games, such as mechanical characters, mechanical equipment, vehicle games, construction games, etc. This article will discuss them from two dimensions: the creation of a sense of mechanics and the enhancement of immersion.</p>
<p>“Sense of mechanics” refers to the player’s subjective feeling about the characters, items, scenes and other elements in the game, whether they feel that these elements are like machines. “Sense of immersion” is whether the player is easy to enter the “flow” state during the game, and whether there is an experience of “I have become a mechanical element”.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The vehicles of <em>World of Tanks</em> and the mechanical structures of <em>Besiege</em> have a stronger sense of mechanics than the protagonist of <em>NieR:Automata</em> and the cartoon wheel of <em>UNO</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The wheel of <em>UNO</em> is only used as a lottery prop, and the construction of <em>Besiege</em> uses a God’s perspective. The sense of immersion is not as good as the other two games that directly let players control characters and tanks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Creating-a-Sense-of-Mechanics"><a href="#Creating-a-Sense-of-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Sense of Mechanics"></a>Creating a Sense of Mechanics</h2><h3 id="01-Following-the-Worldview-Setting"><a href="#01-Following-the-Worldview-Setting" class="headerlink" title="01 Following the Worldview Setting"></a>01 Following the Worldview Setting</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fba2c4908-91b9-4c00-8c64-940ff6727b80.jpg/size/" alt="《Final Fantasy XIII》 Mech Soldier"></p>
<p>The character above uses sheet metal structure and metal materials to reflect the sense of mechanics. From a realistic point of view, its design is not reasonable, and it is suspected of showing off force. But this design is in line with the worldview in the game, that is, a technologically advanced centralized society.</p>
<h3 id="02-Detail-Obsession"><a href="#02-Detail-Obsession" class="headerlink" title="02 Detail Obsession"></a>02 Detail Obsession</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F58f5759b-68d5-410c-b091-54145ae8d0ff.jpg/size/" alt="《Warframe》Character"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fc584d56b-ecab-4d48-92bf-596fe89db43a.png/size/" alt="《Frostpunk》Building"></p>
<p>The same rich details, <em>Warframe</em> focuses on decoration; <em>Frostpunk</em> depicts the steel frame. These functional structures have stronger credibility.</p>
<h3 id="03-Reasonable-Structure"><a href="#03-Reasonable-Structure" class="headerlink" title="03 Reasonable Structure"></a>03 Reasonable Structure</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F91a48388-71f5-4882-9567-931fc73593c8.png/size/" alt="《Oblivion》Drone"></p>
<p>Form follows function. It can be seen from the appearance alone that the weapons and engines can rotate (“circle” and “sphere” shapes, meaning “rotation”). The internal structure explains the reason for this design from a rational point of view.</p>
<h3 id="04-Obeying-the-Laws-of-Physics"><a href="#04-Obeying-the-Laws-of-Physics" class="headerlink" title="04 Obeying the Laws of Physics"></a>04 Obeying the Laws of Physics</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210519%2F4e093805-e15a-4f8c-a7e7-d1492f5500d7.gif/size/" alt="World of Warships (PC), Acceleration and Steering"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F8406d2a5-26d1-4fa5-ab5b-ac9a7df84e7d.gif/size/" alt="World of Warships Blitz (Mobile), Steering While Stationary"></p>
<p>In reality, it takes about 30 minutes for a warship to reach full speed. In the PC game, it is adjusted to about 30 seconds, which can still reflect the sense of cumbersomeness. In the mobile game, the ship turns while it is stationary, and it can even move, which is not realistic.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Ff17dbc9b-33d0-4b16-8059-fb00c18dd5cb.gif/size/" alt="《UNO!》 Spinning Wheel"></p>
<p>The pointer rebound of the wheel in <em>UNO!</em> is well handled, simulating the effect of a ratchet.</p>
<h3 id="05-Interface-Design-and-UI-Design"><a href="#05-Interface-Design-and-UI-Design" class="headerlink" title="05 Interface Design and UI Design"></a>05 Interface Design and UI Design</h3><p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fae008f16-2593-4034-a29f-ce9a595b2e94.jpg/size/" alt="《Soul Knight》 Using Mechs"></p>
<p>Putting on the mech, the appearance and skills of the character change, and borders and hexagons appear on the edge of the screen. Changing or strengthening the mech will change the color and style. Although it is a simple design, it is “rough but reasonable”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fd4f1aaa5-d50d-4c60-9350-8f031f1ea4a7.jpg/size/" alt="《Titanfall 2》 Pilot View (Top) and Titan View (Bottom)"></p>
<p>The difference between the pilot view and the Titan view is: In the Titan view, the skill bar in the lower left corner of the screen has changed, and at the same time, elements of the cockpit have been added to the screen. In addition, the shaking, footsteps and mechanical sounds when walking have been adjusted, and the Titan’s weapon interface has been added.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Gameplay-and-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#Gameplay-and-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay and Sense of Immersion"></a>Gameplay and Sense of Immersion</h2><p>Next, take “ship” as an example to discuss the sense of immersion in the game from the perspective of gameplay.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F9b4f89e8-ce46-4f58-8f31-fd79a833b001.gif/size/" alt="《World of Warships》"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210519%2F2ab4b1e4-67dc-4019-8c5f-6f3f6a573c7f.gif/size/" alt="《Assassin&#39;s Creed IV: Black Flag》"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210519%2F319137dd-1d79-4e23-a5f0-7125fc597357.gif/size/" alt="《Fortnite》"></p>
<p>The coordinate axis below reflects the difference in immersion between these 3 games. Their core gameplay can be simply summarized as “displacement” and “action”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F087b3910-3b6b-4f07-8bdf-ffdc0efa471b.png/size/" alt="Feelings brought by 3 games to players"></p>
<p><strong>World of Warships</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the other 2 games, the gameplay is the simplest, only operating the warship.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the forward, backward and turning of the warship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - artillery, fish, consumables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The object of the player’s operation is always the warship, directly creating the feeling of “I am driving a ship”.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</strong></p>
<p>An RPG game with a naval battle mode. Players can switch between controlling the character or operating the ship (the character walks into or leaves the helm).</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fb7bbf560-7c08-457f-97e2-fd0b74f7101d.gif/size/" alt="Player switching from operating the ship to operating the character"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the movement of the protagonist and the movement of the ship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - the attack, dodge, etc. of the character, and the firing, collision, etc. of the ship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the stage of driving the ship, the object actually operated by the player is the ship, but the game uses camera movement and adds character animation to “deceive” the player.</p>
<p>In the animation, the perspective is close to the third person of the protagonist, and the animation of the protagonist turning the helm can be seen; when firing, the perspective needs to be adjusted to the side of the ship, and the player can see the animation of the protagonist steering (left) and the sailor firing (lower right) at the same time.</p>
<p>After introducing the element of “person”, it will make players feel that “I am operating the character, and the character is driving the ship”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2Fe4a12b9d-bcc5-4692-b898-9573927f3fe3.jpg/size/" alt="The screen when firing"></p>
<p><strong>Fortnite</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Assassin’s Creed, there is a switch between characters and vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Displacement - the walking and jumping of the character and the movement and acceleration of the ship;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action - the attack, construction, and use of consumables of the character, and the attack and use of consumables while sitting on the ship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F1ca40b0f-c4f8-48ec-93d8-3a756cc1857a.jpg/size/" alt="《Fortnite》, Driving and Sitting on a Boat"></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> has a novice tutorial, and the two gameplays are slightly different in operation, while <em>Fortnite</em> directly uses the keys and perspectives when operating the character. One player can only choose to drive the boat (mainly considering displacement) or sit on the boat (mainly considering action, using weapons to attack), and the learning cost is low.</p>
<p>In the vehicle mode, the camera is the same as the normal mode, which further reduces the feeling of switching between the character and the ship. It is the game that is most like “I am operating the character” among the 3 games.</p>
<h3 id="Methods-of-Designing-a-Sense-of-Immersion"><a href="#Methods-of-Designing-a-Sense-of-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Designing a Sense of Immersion"></a>Methods of Designing a Sense of Immersion</h3><p><strong>01 The object actually controlled by the player is a machine</strong></p>
<p>The previous article analyzed this point from the perspective of gameplay. If the control object is a character, but still needs to operate the machine, what will happen?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F35b7ba17-b719-462d-9942-ecb30a1cd111.gif/size/" alt="《RAFT》, Simulating Rafting at Sea"></p>
<p>Players need to turn on the engine, light up the radar, and operate the rudder. This gameplay is suitable for business simulation games. The ship is not like a whole, but a combination of parts; The player’s attention is not on the ship, but on the character.</p>
<p><strong>02 The player’s psychological feelings can be realized through guidance</strong></p>
<p>The camera movement and character animation in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> are examples of excellent use of this method.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can also use the switch between pilots and Titans in <em>Titanfall</em> to illustrate:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F2b903c83-af4a-4d40-85f2-b9ebd3092a44.gif/size/" alt="Game video, the pilot boards the Titan"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F97e060c8-297c-4b4c-8751-c8feaa5d3934.gif/size/" alt="Processed video with boarding animation removed"></p>
<p>In the first picture, players will feel that the Titan belongs to the pilot’s equipment;</p>
<p>In the second picture, the pilot and Titan seem to have become two independent characters in the game, and players can choose one to control.</p>
<p>The guidance method can adjust the sense of immersion in the game.</p>
<p><strong>03 Switching control objects cannot bring cognitive burden</strong></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, switching from controlling the character to controlling the ship is a positive case.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug 1</em> is a counterexample:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20210518%2F23ea9a0a-4892-49a0-9962-3848b855415e.gif/size/" alt="《Metal Slug 1》, Operating the Machine Gun"></p>
<p>In other levels, the shooting direction is the same as the moving direction, but in this level, it is opposite. If you want to shoot from right to left, the player needs to press the right direction key.</p>
<p>Because it uses the action of the gun (shooting), but matches the displacement of the character (opposite to the shooting direction), it may be a mechanism to increase the difficulty, but it does destroy the sense of immersion during the game.</p>
<p>How to design the mechanical elements in the game well is a huge topic. This article only makes some thoughts on the mentioned games from some angles. “Sense of mechanics” and “sense of immersion” are both ways to construct the game experience. I hope this sharing can bring you some inspiration.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-GDC"><a href="#What-is-GDC" class="headerlink" title="What is GDC?"></a>What is GDC?</h3><p>GDC (Game Developers Conference) is the world’s most influential game developer conference, held annually in San Francisco, and has a history of 35 years. Although tickets for the week-long conference cost up to $2,000, as many as 27,000 industry professionals attend in person, demonstrating its value and authority. The highlight of GDC is the non-sponsored keynote speeches. Each year, the organizers invite less than 300 presentations on average, divided into two categories: Core and Summit. These speakers are carefully selected and invited by the organizers and their global advisory committee. They are highly recognized by the industry for their high quality and innovation, and to some extent represent the current highest level and development trend of the game industry.</p>
<p>Since 2020, due to COVID-19, it has been changed to an online format. The 2021 GDC conference was held from July 19th to 23rd.</p>
<hr>
<p>A presentation titled “Queuing: Let Data Guide Your Server Opening Strategy” was selected for this year’s GDC Online Game Technology Summit. This is the second time that NetEase Games Leihuo UX User Experience Center’s data mining team has been selected since its first participation in GDC in 2020. The presentation mainly discusses how to analyze the queuing mechanism from the perspective of game big data to assist games in flexibly adjusting server opening strategies and their application technologies. Two flexible server opening strategies are proposed in the presentation: “diversion” and “redirection”. The former avoids the risk of high server load by real-time monitoring and calculation of game queues and server logs, and opens servers in time to divert queues. The latter strategy is suitable for planned operational activity plans, combining player game portraits and players’ autonomous choices to direct players to designated servers in the plan, thereby bringing a better gaming experience.</p>
<p>The speaker is Sure from the data mining team of NetEase Games Leihuo UX User Experience Center. Today, Leihuo UX official website will give you an introduction.</p>
<p>As a senior data mining engineer, he joined the Leihuo UX data mining team as an intern in 2017 during his graduate studies at Zhejiang University, and took on the data mining work for the third test of <em>Justice</em>. His love for games and excellent data mining skills enabled him to grow rapidly during his internship and join the Leihuo UX data team. The first game he was independently responsible for data mining as a full-time employee was <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em>. During the launch period of the game’s national server, with his data mining foundation, he took the initiative to undertake the game’s full-process data mining work, and helped the game launch smoothly. He then took on the data work for the game’s overseas version throughout its entire life cycle. Half a year later, he began to follow up on the PC version of <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, during which he greatly optimized the PC game’s log processing process and established PC game log specifications, further ensuring data quality. The PC and mobile game work experience accumulated during his work was summarized into processes and specifications and widely used within the team.</p>
<p>Following the growth and expansion of Leihuo and the Leihuo UX team, in early 2019, he began to serve as one of the leaders of the data mining team, leading team members to be responsible for more game product data services, including <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, <em>Lovebrush Chronicles</em>, <em>Hyper Scape</em>, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, <em>UNO!</em>, <em>Revelation Online</em>, <em>MARVEL Duel</em>, and more. “Data creates more game value” has always been the team’s goal. With the team’s unremitting efforts, the test and launch data work of game products has been successfully completed time and time again, and the player’s game experience has been continuously improved, helping game products achieve success.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="Game-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Game-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Game: Naraka: Bladepoint"></a><em>Game: Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><p>In addition to providing high-quality and agile basic data work, as the leader of the data mining team, he began to think about and upgrade existing businesses and expand new businesses. At the end of 2019, he participated in and led the data-side development of the new Tianyan BI data platform, which was officially launched. The platform launched a general BI module, integrated general logic, greatly reduced the development manpower of key indicators, provided richer visualization controls, and brought a standard data BI development model, which was well received by product owners after launch. Subsequently, he led the team to develop Leihuo UX’s self-developed recommendation system in stages, successively launching an AB test platform and algorithm services, which were applied to <em>UNO!</em>.</p>

<p><em>Game: UNO!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the beginning of this year, he was successfully promoted to Data Mining Supervisor, and he is also one of the youngest supervisors to be promoted in NetEase in the same period. Let us look forward to his more achievements in the field of data mining and more active presence on the GDC stage!</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211012/28584_977961.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Literary works use words to express ideas, film and television works use images and sounds to convey themes, while games can both carry the content that words want to express and borrow the techniques of movies to create an immersive feeling. Games also have an irreplaceable advantage - players can participate in interactions and write the direction of the story themselves. As a game designer, how do you build this grand “virtual world”?</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-Worldview-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-Worldview-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does Worldview Mean?"></a>What Does Worldview Mean?</h2><p>Games are the inner expression of the creators. Whether it is an independent game, a single-player game, or a commercial game, the design of the worldview is a crucial part. Its existence will set the tone for the game framework and will also guide most of the text creation and element design in the game. A successful game must have an excellent worldview to support it - like the “iceberg theory”, what we can see is only a part of the game creator showing to the players, and a larger part of the world is hidden in a deeper level, unknown to people.</p>
<h3 id="Consistency-of-Worldview"><a href="#Consistency-of-Worldview" class="headerlink" title="Consistency of Worldview"></a>Consistency of Worldview</h3><p>A well-structured game worldview needs to be composed of various connections and meanings. When such a worldview is running, every part of this world will abide by its operating rules, and these parts can coexist reasonably. An excellent worldview, because the internal logic of its composition is too large, although it has a grand story background that can be tapped, it is almost never presented to players in a straightforward manner.</p>
<p>If a game designer wants to build a consistent worldview, the challenge they need to face is to “understand the internal connections of the world”. Just like the real world, the virtual world also has backgrounds in physics, history, politics, culture, and other levels. At the same time, it can also incorporate virtual elements such as science fiction and gods to add novelty to the game settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Fdfcfc577-0866-48fa-8ae8-c68ba3d64718.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;dfcfc577-0866-48fa-8ae8-c68ba3d64718.png"></p>
<p>In <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, the structure of the world has reached a very high degree of completeness. When players complete the main line, they have actually only explored a small part of the world. If you are a warrior, you can experience the faith of the Companions; if you want to become an Arch-Mage, you can go to the College of Winterhold to challenge yourself; you can also experience the arduous and exciting life of a thief, or enter the romantic world of a bard… In addition, there are many tasks unrelated to careers waiting for players to experience. Therefore, players will feel that this is a real world, there seem to be endless stories to experience, and it seems that they can always adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Fa8181589-03bb-4e58-a0e9-aca281e83e38.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;a8181589-03bb-4e58-a0e9-aca281e83e38.png"></p>
<p>It is not only plot games that need to construct a complete worldview. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, as a battle royale game, also insists on building a worldview IP during design. In the process of players experiencing the game, the background stories of different characters are different, and players can start to explore the world gradually from different branches of the story. By talking to different heroes, you can get fragments related to the background story. This makes players, after experiencing the exciting battles of the game, still have the enthusiasm to explore the game world.</p>
<h3 id="Internal-Logic-of-Worldview"><a href="#Internal-Logic-of-Worldview" class="headerlink" title="Internal Logic of Worldview"></a>Internal Logic of Worldview</h3><p>In Europe, which has many mountains, few plains, and blocked land transportation, a maritime civilization that loves freedom and adventure has developed; in the two river basins with vast plains and a suitable climate, an agricultural civilization that is attached to the land has been nurtured. There is always a causal relationship between the development of time and space in the world, and the construction of the virtual world must also follow the rationality of logic.</p>
<p>When creating a virtual world, it is best to have the subconscious of cognitive principles and perceptual principles, rather than being too radical and subversive, challenging the player’s cognition, because it is very difficult to challenge the existing cognitive system to reconstruct logic. If you are not careful, the game will collapse in the player’s mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Fb1fac686-9eec-42b2-8e14-94de260ee031.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;b1fac686-9eec-42b2-8e14-94de260ee031.png"></p>
<p>In <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, the game company created a world where androids and humans coexist, allowing androids to have self-awareness, simulate humanity, obey human control, but also have the impulse to resist and escape. All settings are fantasies that are divorced from the real world, but they secretly follow the logic of the world line.</p>
<p>In the movie-like plot advancement, <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> prompts players to think about the balance between technology and ethics, as well as deeper social issues, racial issues, and political topics.</p>
<h2 id="World-Narrative"><a href="#World-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="World Narrative"></a>World Narrative</h2><p>Everything in the game world tells a story, and players can learn about the history of the virtual world by exploring the space. The way of telling stories through buildings, scenes, sound effects, and things in them is world narrative.</p>
<p>The information that makes up the worldview is like pieces of a puzzle, each piece showing a small part of the world. Players collect pieces of information through continuous exploration. When the information obtained reaches a certain amount, they will build a basic understanding of the virtual time and space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Fcfd12930-3b27-441d-8a10-21ef7ae83311.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;cfd12930-3b27-441d-8a10-21ef7ae83311.png"></p>
<p>World narrative is not limited to the statements of words and characters, it is more about creating an “atmosphere” to allow players in it to get deep resonance. A devastated city can tell players that there was a war here; magnificent buildings can be associated with the prosperity of empires, royal families, and countries; secret underground organizations indicate that the local customs are strict, but there are still villains lurking in the dark.</p>
<h3 id="Non-linear-Storytelling"><a href="#Non-linear-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Non-linear Storytelling"></a>Non-linear Storytelling</h3><p>The narration of a world narrative does not have to follow a linear narrative method, that is, players do not need to follow a designated route to explore the plot during the game. This means that in the process of exploring the world, players have the freedom to explore the game according to their own behavioral logic. For example, during the game, players need to solve a mystery, and two clues are needed to solve the mystery. In the narration of the world story, no matter which clue the player finds first, it can guide the story to the final answer. In the process of exploration, other clues in other environments will also be used to learn about other information about the world.</p>
<p>In contrast, scripted stories rely on pre-made events to control the key process of the game. Scripted stories sometimes block all interactive behaviors, so too many scripted stories will destroy the game experience, but appropriate addition can allow players to better understand the main plot that the developer wants to convey and relax the player’s mood appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F07dc5604-e40e-4b62-a4e3-1ba3bc1d681f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;07dc5604-e40e-4b62-a4e3-1ba3bc1d681f.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2Faa0a7834-4c73-45d4-85b2-a2debdfff39e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;aa0a7834-4c73-45d4-85b2-a2debdfff39e.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Tomb Raider》 combines scripted stories with world stories; the sorting ceremony in 《Harry Potter》 is a scripted story</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the content of the world narrative allows players to experience it multiple times. Like the player’s cognition of the real world, in the process of multiple experiences, from rough to specific, slowly discover all the details of the event and improve the plot of the story.</p>
<h3 id="Recording-Stories-Through-Carriers"><a href="#Recording-Stories-Through-Carriers" class="headerlink" title="Recording Stories Through Carriers"></a>Recording Stories Through Carriers</h3><p>When we tell stories in an open world, since players can freely control the actions of the characters, they may make various behaviors that deviate from the expectations of the game designers. Therefore, in game design, various methods need to be used to restrict the player’s behavior, which makes game design more tricky and also increases the development cost. But world narratives are often events that have already happened, and no matter what choices the player makes, they are already established facts that cannot be changed.</p>
<p>With this advantage, world narrative has become an important tool for storytelling in game design, used to solve a large number of key problems caused by interaction. It can be described in words, for example, through various character dialogues and letters, postings, to convey information, it can also use sound instead of words, or be placed in some video carriers - news broadcasts, video tapes, street screens, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F7339e45d-47fb-439d-9f03-5ab3bc92b2f9.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;7339e45d-47fb-439d-9f03-5ab3bc92b2f9.png"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The game industry is paying more and more attention to the design of worldview and story. To make a game that allows players to have an in-depth experience, the needs of functions alone are not enough. Game developers create a game world that is both real and illusory in various ways, creating flesh and blood beyond cold data, so that they can create works that touch people’s hearts again and again.</p>

    <title>When Players Say &quot;I Don&#39;t Like the Game&#39;s Art Style,&quot; What Do They Really Mean?</title>
    <url>/2021/10/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20211012_28584_978014/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211012/28584_978014.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sentiment analysis, user researchers often encounter players giving vague, subjective feedback, especially in areas such as game art and story, such as: “I don’t really like the art style of your game”, “I feel the world-building is not good, not interested” … What’s more troublesome is that these feedbacks seem to be mostly “emotional output”, and cannot clearly point to problems that the product can perceive and ultimately form落地 (luò dì, meaning ‘grounded’ or ‘practical’) improvement measures.</p>
<p>Do players dislike the overall style? Or do they dislike the specific art or story design? Why don’t they like it? What targeted adjustments can the product make to reverse the player’s evaluation? If we want to understand these deep-seated needs behind players’ “emotional output”, user researchers need certain research methods to dig into their real thoughts, such as more detailed 1v1 interviews. How to do it specifically? This sharing will take the player’s evaluation of the game’s art style as an example to show you how to deeply understand the real thoughts of players by splitting and detailing the “art style” in the design and actual use of interview questions.</p>
<h2 id="Deconstruction-Which-Details-in-the-Game-Will-Affect-Players’-Perception-of-the-Overall-“Art-Style”"><a href="#Deconstruction-Which-Details-in-the-Game-Will-Affect-Players’-Perception-of-the-Overall-“Art-Style”" class="headerlink" title="Deconstruction: Which Details in the Game Will Affect Players’ Perception of the Overall “Art Style”?"></a>Deconstruction: Which Details in the Game Will Affect Players’ Perception of the Overall “Art Style”?</h2><p>To understand what specific factors prompted players to give negative reviews of the game’s art style, the first thing to do is to deconstruct the relatively general term “art style”: when players evaluate the game’s art style, what modules and details will they think of? Based on past experience in art style research, we have compiled the following detailed elements:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Module</th>
<th align="left">Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Overall Atmosphere</td>
<td align="left">Overall color, lighting, saturation, brightness, whether the elements are in harmony, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Character Design</td>
<td align="left">Character modeling, clothing, accessories, body proportions, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Scene Design</td>
<td align="left">Building modeling, special effects, color matching, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">UI Design</td>
<td align="left">Interface fonts, frame design, color matching, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Animation and Special Effects</td>
<td align="left">Action fluency, special effects presentation, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Other</td>
<td align="left">Whether it conforms to the world view, whether it matches the gameplay, etc.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>With the deconstruction of all the module details that may affect the player’s evaluation of the game’s “art style”, in the questionnaire and interview question settings of the 1v1 art style test, we can design specific questions for these detailed points. For example, in a test on players’ art style evaluation, we carried out some detailed digging for product needs and some feedback points that players might have in the pre-test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>“Do you think the overall art style is acceptable?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Completely Unacceptable”</li>
<li>“Unacceptable”</li>
<li>“Acceptable”</li>
<li>“Can fully accept”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“What are the reasons for your previous choice?”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“What do you like about the art design of this game?”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“What do you <em>not</em> like about the art design of this game?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only in questionnaire and interview design, but also in the final presentation of player feedback, user researchers also need to explore and summarize the details of different aspects, and strive to provide a complete blueprint for the product’s art improvement strategy. For example, in one test, overall, players were not satisfied with the game’s art style, but when analyzing player feedback, we found that players’ specific dissatisfaction with the game’s art could be roughly categorized into three aspects: in-game art, appearance art, and interface art.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Main Dissatisfaction Aspect</th>
<th align="left">Specific Issues</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Combat Scene Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Scenes are monotonous, lacking atmosphere, character models and actions are stiff, special effects are not gorgeous</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Character&#x2F;Item Appearance Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Character models are not good-looking, clothing lacks characteristics, wings are too large</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>UI Interface Art</strong></td>
<td align="left">Fonts are not beautiful, icons are not exquisite</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Therefore, when providing suggestions for modification, we will also look for details of relevant competing products for reference according to the players’ art needs at different levels. For example, in terms of in-game art, we referred to some designs of Onmyoji and provided some more practical suggestions, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adding scene interactions with the environment (Grass interactions, environment destruction)</li>
<li>Add Weather Effects, and have them tied into environment interactions (Rain effects)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Mining-Beyond-Art-Design-Factors-That-May-Also-Affect-Players’-Style-Evaluation"><a href="#Mining-Beyond-Art-Design-Factors-That-May-Also-Affect-Players’-Style-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Mining: Beyond Art Design, Factors That May Also Affect Players’ Style Evaluation"></a>Mining: Beyond Art Design, Factors That May Also Affect Players’ Style Evaluation</h2><p>Some may think that as long as all the elements in the game that may affect the player’s art style evaluation are listed, the player’s one or several specific deep-seated needs can always be found. In fact, this is not the case. When evaluating some special styles, the influence of art design itself may not be as great as imagined. Instead, there are other things outside the game that may affect the player’s “first impression”. For example, in a research on the art style of a game with a Western fantasy background, a player said:</p>
<p>“I don’t really like the art style of this game… I can’t say exactly, I just don’t like it. I usually prefer to play games like Onmyoji.”</p>
<p>Although the player did not give specific art feedback suggestions, his words actually hid the reason why he did not accept the art style of the research game - the influence of other games. Obviously, the player’s game experience will shape his game art preferences to a large extent.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Players will have their <em>own</em> preferences that have been shaped by their <em>prior</em> experiences.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Different types of games will tend to have distinct styles.</li>
<li>If you are attempting to deviate, expect resistance from players who prefer a certain style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The art preferences of players of different game genres are largely influenced by popular games of that genre. How to attract players of different genres into the game as much as possible and meet their art-related needs has become the focus of many game development teams.</p>
<p>In addition, other media or pop culture product experiences also affect some players’ art evaluation of some specific style games to a considerable extent. Still in this research on the Western fantasy background game, some players gave feedback like this:</p>
<p>“I don’t really like the art style of this game, I just think it’s very ordinary… I have actually seen the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series before, and I feel that some of the elements inside are too familiar…”</p>
<p>Obviously, the player buried a pitfall in this feedback. Does he accept the Western fantasy art style? If you only look at the first half of the feedback, the answer may be yes. But later, when he mentioned the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, a new question arose: if he can accept movies of this style, why didn’t he accept games of similar styles and elements? Obviously, behind this answer, there are still some deeper art needs waiting for us to explore.</p>
<h2 id="In-Conclusion"><a href="#In-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In Conclusion"></a>In Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is the product or the user researcher, when facing players’ evaluations such as “I don’t like the art style” and “I don’t like the world view and story style”, they may be somewhat confused - where are their points of dissatisfaction? Do we really have such a problem? If so, what improvements should we make? In fact, we can deconstruct these general feedback points through forms such as 1v1 player interviews or research, and finally dig out the needs behind these dissatisfaction emotions. Here, the spirit of “getting to the bottom of things” is very important.</p>

    <title>Is Beauty Objective or Subjective? - Characters and Appearances in Games</title>
    <url>/2021/09/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20211012_28584_978017/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211012/28584_978017.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>In the 1999 International Varsity Debate final, the University of Malaya and Xi’an Jiaotong University brought a wonderful battle of wits to debate enthusiasts. Relying on “solid argumentation, quick thinking, and beautiful imagery”, the four swordsmen of Xi’an Jiaotong University were invincible, easily winning the national debate, and the topic of “Is beauty objective or subjective” also triggered reflection.</p>
<p>But let’s be a little more down-to-earth, take “beauty” down from the crown of philosophy, and put it in the more approachable game, will the conclusion change? This is also a question that many game products are concerned about: what kind of characters and appearances will be favored by players?</p>
<h2 id="There-is-no-harm-without-comparison"><a href="#There-is-no-harm-without-comparison" class="headerlink" title="There is no harm without comparison"></a>There is no harm without comparison</h2><p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, female character appearances are more popular than male character appearances. Kurumi, with her rambling voice pack, is already half-way out of the circle. The phrase “Can you come and help Kurumi?” has penetrated deeply into the hearts of players. However, the popularity of female character appearances is not only related to the design of female characters, but more importantly, people’s aesthetics of men have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F47b5c848-852d-424f-9bbe-6b5dc287a088.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;47b5c848-852d-424f-9bbe-6b5dc287a088.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1: Male and female characters in Justice Online</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We may wish to list some of the characters of martial arts MMORPGs, it is not difficult to find that all the male characters in the game have long been out of the traditional martial arts image of the strong man, and move towards the direction of the celestial being. Just like the popular animated film Ne Zha, the image of the dragon prince is exactly like this (including Ne Zha after transformation). If the dragon prince is replaced by an image with a more martial arts flavor like Li Kui or Lu Zhishen, it is estimated that no one will ship them anymore.</p>
<p>As for the female image, foreign game manufacturers have begun to try to make a lot of changes. For example, Rob Gallerani, the game design director of the recent Diablo II: Resurrected, also said that the female Amazon warrior will be greatly modified in the remake. The new Amazon warrior looks stronger and more sturdy. The reason for this design is to make the Amazon female warrior look more like a warrior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F4cc6288e-f295-4ea9-addf-5330c66ee4bb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;4cc6288e-f295-4ea9-addf-5330c66ee4bb.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 2: The original and remastered Amazon warriors</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The same situation also appears in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, “Only for PlayStation”. Aloy goes from an unrecognized marginal character to a hero with a mission. Her agility and wisdom are no less than any male. The game strongly downplays the sense of gender in the tribe. Perhaps the development team hopes that players will feel the charm of the character itself, not her gender or appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F7e1f0cbd-09d1-4f86-9dc5-148afa9175d6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;7e1f0cbd-09d1-4f86-9dc5-148afa9175d6.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3: Horizon heroine Aloy</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Such examples are becoming more and more common in overseas masterpieces, and these situations have indeed been resisted by some players. At this time, bring the topic back. The male characters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> did not take the route of the celestial beings in the previous domestic online games and single-player RPGs, but chose a more tough guy route, which is determined by the project team’s positioning of each character. But the result is that no matter how the style of fashion is designed, it will not be as acceptable as the female characters when placed on the tough guy role. This is a choice.</p>
<h2 id="Unified-Aesthetics-but-Not-Completely-Unified"><a href="#Unified-Aesthetics-but-Not-Completely-Unified" class="headerlink" title="Unified Aesthetics, but Not Completely Unified"></a>Unified Aesthetics, but Not Completely Unified</h2><p>The above-mentioned is indeed the change of all the major trends, but people’s aesthetic preferences must be different. For example, men and women have different aesthetics for specific skins. For example, a costume called “Butterfly Dream” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has reached the highest quality - red. As a red skin, whether compared with the red skin of the same level or with other appearances of Kurumi, the popularity of this appearance has not reached the expected level. Because as the highest quality skin, the developer certainly believes that this skin’s design sense, special effects and gorgeousness have reached the highest level. We also hope that this skin will become the most acclaimed skin, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211012%2F971183d8-12cc-4f9f-b77f-568f18659f3a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211012&#x2F;971183d8-12cc-4f9f-b77f-568f18659f3a.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4: Red skin “Butterfly Dream”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>According to our research, most men praised the “Butterfly Dream” costume, but when it came to female players, the girls’ praise for Butterfly Dream plummeted, and they also put forward various suggestions about the costume. Of course, gender is only one of the important influencing factors. If other cross-analysis is done, other interesting answers may be obtained, but it is certain that the aesthetics of different players are absolutely different. Previously, it was said that tough guys may not be as popular as tall and slender men, but it is only a trend. The composition of players is still a factor that game developers have to consider.</p>
<h2 id="Rationality-in-Sensibility"><a href="#Rationality-in-Sensibility" class="headerlink" title="Rationality in Sensibility"></a>Rationality in Sensibility</h2><p>Regarding whether the character&#x2F;skin looks good, there is actually another rule, that is, white&#x2F;light-colored skins will be more popular than black&#x2F;dark-colored skins. In skins of the same quality, light-colored skins will be better than dark-colored skins. This has almost become an objective rule, and even the color system has become the most important factor for players to choose, and the sensitivity has exceeded the quality. A purple-quality light-colored skin may be more popular than a yellow-quality dark-colored skin. But why is this the case?</p>
<p>This question seems very emotional and there is no logic to speak of. This is indeed the case. It is difficult for you to directly answer why the same skin is more popular in white than in black. But in fact, there must be a trace of rationality in sensibility. We have considered many factors, such as the background when trying on clothes, the relationship between texture and color, the fit of the skin and the character, and so on. For example, the influence of background and light. Under daily light, the lighter the shape, the more obvious the light and shadow effect, and the more obvious the contrast between light and dark. This is why beginners in sketching initially draw white plaster geometric bodies instead of black geometric bodies. The more common principle is makeup. Eyeliner, nose shadow, lipstick, and eyebrow trimming are all to highlight the facial features, while the foundation is to weaken the details of the cheeks, such as some spots, scars, and pores, so that people’s attention is focused on the facial features. So much effort is spent on the facial features, it is to make the contrast stronger. Of course, a whiter skin tone can also be easier to set off.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5: White makes objects more three-dimensional</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the fit of the skin and the character is another very key factor. In our research process, we found that players have a specific “color positioning” for each character of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. For example, players think that Ning Hongye should be red, Kurumi should be pink, and Canaan should be white. This will also become another important factor affecting players’ purchase. For example, although the quality of Kurumi’s pink appearance is not the highest, even just blue, players’ evaluation of it will exceed many higher-quality skins.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Returning to the question at the beginning of the full text: what kind of characters and appearances will be favored by players, it is difficult to come to a certain answer. People’s views on “beauty” have been changing and have never been unified, but from the above discussion, we may be able to get a glimpse of the aesthetic concepts of different players. In fact, from another perspective, the design of each character image or skin is the product of the careful conception of art designers. After being imported into the game, there may be comparisons of high and low sales, but everyone’s pursuit of beauty is always unrelenting. Perhaps it is precisely because of their wild imagination that people’s cognition of “beauty” has no conclusion.</p>

<p>Do you remember the frog son you raised in those years? When you open <em>Tabi Kaeru (Travel Frog)</em> with a忐忑 (tǎn tè - uneasy; apprehensive) mood, not knowing if your baby frog has come home, packing his bags for him, paying attention to his every move, and smiling like a loving mother when you see the postcards he sent back… That’s right, you are hooked. This type of education simulation game (养成游戏 - yǎng chéng yóu xì) is a branch of simulation games. “Raising” (养成 - yǎng chéng) is its core element. Players need to cultivate a specific object (human or animal) in the game and make it successful. The sense of accomplishment brought by the game is the key to keeping players hooked.</p>

The Psychological Mechanism Behind “Raising”</h2><p>Raising games are divided into many categories, such as love raising, assistant raising, pet raising, and parent-child raising. The attributes of the raised object determine the development of the game plot and the outcome of the player’s game. For example, the object’s level qualifications, item equipment, skills, image skins, etc.</p>

<p>The addictive feeling in raising games lies in people’s psychology of “the more you get, the more you want” (Diderot effect or matching effect), which refers to the phenomenon that when people don’t get something, they feel very calm, but once they get it, they are not satisfied and constantly configure items that match it. In the game, the novice tutorial triggers new players to act, complete tasks, and receive corresponding rewards; then it triggers user investment and forms a closed loop. In the process, the attributes of the object are constantly changing and upgrading. Players get satisfaction from it, and the sunk cost continues to push users to enter the next round of closed loop.</p>

The child’s attributes determine the direction of the plot and the ending. Players need to arrange the child’s learning tasks with limited physical strength. According to the different schedules arranged by the player, the child’s IQ, EQ, physical strength, memory, imagination, and courage will change accordingly. Players also need to balance parental satisfaction and the child’s stress. In the game, the child’s admission results and future development are the incentives for players to constantly invest time. In essence, it is an opportunity for players to “redo” their lives in the game. It is to satisfy the player’s self-actualization and high-level needs, and it is also the reason why this type of raising game makes players play happily.</p>

<p>In the game, in addition to being expressed in the form of numerical values, these attributes are also designed in the form of elimination games as a brain map.

<p>The game also includes many interesting plots and settings —– face-to-face battles between parents, class committee elections, red envelope wars, Chinese talents, and so on. The authenticity of these details makes many players see their childhood selves.

<p>For players, winning in fierce challenges is the main source of their satisfaction. When the difficulty continues to increase, players may feel frustrated in the challenge, and the raising system will come into play at this time; on the one hand, by increasing the level, the player’s winning rate is improved. On the other hand, the raising system provides players with feedback and rewards, invisibly helping users to subdivide tasks. Through the cycle of raising and challenge, users are guided to invest more time and cost. Offset the accumulation of users’ negative emotions, and improve users’ stickiness and loyalty.</p>

<p>This is actually the application of Pavlov’s classical conditioning theory. Pavlov’s experiments show that neutral stimuli (bells, red lights, etc.) that originally could not cause a certain instinctive reflex, when they appear repeatedly with stimuli that can cause instinctive reflexes, this neutral stimulus can also cause instinctive reflexes.</p>
<p>Players constantly train the raised objects in the process of challenge, and the objects win in the duel. Strengthens the connection between raising and victory, making the raising process more “enjoyable”. Form a learned reflex and increase the satisfaction that users get during the raising process.</p>
<p>Different behaviors of players in the raising system. Such as collecting materials, upgrading, training, etc., will bring users a certain sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Repeating the “raising - challenge” cycle strengthens the player’s association with raising and victory.</p>
<p>Under repeated cycles, the satisfaction brought by the raising system is enhanced.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to challenge, the raising process has also become an important source of the game’s sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The two cooperate to effectively balance the negative emotions brought by players facing stronger opponents, balance the rhythm of the game, and constantly give players positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>The interaction between the raising system and the challenge system</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Establish a connection between the raising system and the challenge system, and constantly cycle to improve the positive experience of user raising.</p>
<p>Of course, the setting of the raising system needs to consider the following two points:</p>
<h3 id="Rhythm"><a href="#Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="Rhythm"></a>Rhythm</h3><p>It is mainly manifested as the time and frequency of the player’s actions on the raised object. High-frequency raising can make players get greater satisfaction in experience, but the player’s excitement will also decrease with the marginal effect. In addition, if the raising takes too long, players may lose patience before they are willing to invest a lot of time and cost, and directly abandon the pit. But on the other hand, the rhythm of the raising system determines the time and cost spent by players in the strategy. When the game update speed cannot keep up with the player’s strategy speed, it may also face a decline in player loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="Balance"><a href="#Balance" class="headerlink" title="Balance"></a>Balance</h3><p>The number of raised objects is related to the scalability of the game. Raised objects with different attributes and characteristics can bring higher degrees of freedom to the challenge system, and also determine the development space of the game. However, when designing raised objects, attention should be paid to grasping their balance and making them restrain each other. At the same time, avoid homogenization and retain uniqueness. Avoid players losing their sense of freshness and enthusiasm.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Raising games take advantage of the player’s psychology of “the more you get, the more you want”, allowing players to invest time and energy. In this process, the satisfaction that players get is an important reason for their addiction. Whether it is victory in battle, the growth of the raised object, the direction of the plot… These feedbacks meet the player’s needs for self-actualization in the game, so that they can learn conditioned reflexes in the cycle, and constantly bring players a sense of pleasure.</p>

    <title>Emotional Design Reference for NPC Affinity System</title>
    <url>/2021/10/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20211018_28584_979609/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211018/28584_979609.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emotional design refers to a design approach that takes users’ feelings and emotions as the starting point. Emotional thinking is ubiquitous in games, such as the atmosphere created in the game world during real-world festivals, game sprites with cute appearances that greet you, and world announcements when rare treasures are unearthed (the system helps you show off), and so on. Among the various emotional design elements in games, falling in love and making friends with NPCs is a relatively unique experience for many players. Especially in recent years, in order to make this process feel more realistic, and not just a stack of numbers, planners will plan the interactive content between players and NPCs based on emotional development. To be more realistic, it must be more like the emotional development between two “living people.” The most commonly referenced rule for emotional development between people is “Social Penetration Theory.”</p>
<h2 id="Social-Penetration-Theory"><a href="#Social-Penetration-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Social Penetration Theory"></a>Social Penetration Theory</h2><p>Social penetration theory refers to the process of relationship development that individuals experience from superficial communication to intimate communication. This theory was proposed by Irvin Altman and Dalmas Taylor (1973). Social penetration theory believes that intimacy is not only manifested physically, but also includes intellectual, emotional, and participation in activities together. Therefore, the social penetration process must include verbal behavior (our words), nonverbal behavior (body posture, expressions, etc.), and environmentally oriented behavior (the distance between the communicator and the audience, etc.).</p>
<p>In social penetration theory, the escalation of intimate relationships between people can be divided into the following stages:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Orientation</td>
<td>Individuals reveal small parts of themselves, engaging in small talk and simple, harmless clichés.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exploratory Affective</td>
<td>Individuals start to reveal more about themselves, such as their opinions and attitudes on moderately personal topics. This is the stage where casual friendships develop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Affective</td>
<td>Individuals become comfortable discussing private and personal matters. Criticism and arguments may arise. Close friendships and intimate relationships develop at this stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stable</td>
<td>The relationship reaches a plateau where personal aspects are shared openly and freely. The individuals have a deep understanding of each other, and their communication is highly efficient and predictable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Depenetration   <em>(not always present)</em></td>
<td>When the relationship starts to break down and costs exceed benefits, there is a withdrawal of disclosure, which leads to termination of the relationship.  This theory does not typically include depenetration stage.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Specifically in the game, taking the example of <em>Revelation M</em> and the interaction with Sikong Wangyue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F2cc1bf84-a7e4-4ae3-a124-d889eab480ab.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;2cc1bf84-a7e4-4ae3-a124-d889eab480ab.png"></p>
<h3 id="Orientation-Stage"><a href="#Orientation-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Orientation Stage"></a>Orientation Stage</h3><p>In the orientation stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of unexpected encounters and casual acquaintances. The topics of conversation are relatively shallow, the NPC’s attitude is not proactive, there is little interaction, and at least one party in the conversation is relatively polite. Wangyue will accept gifts from the player, but will not be proactive towards the player. Activities only include accepting the player’s team invitations and rumor commissions. The player’s understanding of Wangyue is limited to Wangyue’s displayed personality and behavior, and they do not understand Wangyue’s own story. They can only unlock some daily polite phrases (Echo Shells).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F80867190-93b5-4e77-a81f-395defbf03ee.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;80867190-93b5-4e77-a81f-395defbf03ee.png"></p>
<h3 id="Exploratory-Affective-Stage"><a href="#Exploratory-Affective-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Exploratory Affective Stage"></a>Exploratory Affective Stage</h3><p>In the exploratory affective stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of like-mindedness and regret not meeting sooner. There is some two-person interactive content, and they will expose themselves more in the conversation, and even proactively trouble the player. Wangyue is willing to be dressed up by the player (after being dressed up, Wangyue in the open world will look like the player dressed him up), and Wangyue will invite you to participate in a friend’s gathering.</p>

<h3 id="Affective-Stage"><a href="#Affective-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Affective Stage"></a>Affective Stage</h3><p>In the affective stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of mutual support. The chat topics involve emotional attitudes and more intimate two-person interactions. The interaction of drinking with Wangyue is unlocked. In the process of chatting with the player, Wangyue will act coquettishly (not so polite and distant) and will also tease the player (unlocking the Echo Shell “Reluctant to part with me?”), and will also reveal some of his own views on life and emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211018%2F31cc5abb-3dc2-41ca-98ed-48f5cf7b739c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211018&#x2F;31cc5abb-3dc2-41ca-98ed-48f5cf7b739c.png"></p>
<h3 id="Stable-Stage"><a href="#Stable-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Stable Stage"></a>Stable Stage</h3><p>In the stable stage, the player and Wangyue are in a state of mutual understanding and mutual affection. There are more private interactions and a more proactive attitude, and even more intimate nicknames. In the open world, the player can summon Wangyue to their side. Wangyue will send private messages to the player and proactively invite the player to go out (previous invitations were after the player talked to Wangyue, Wangyue invited the player to go together, this time Wangyue discovered something interesting and invited the player to go together).</p>

<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Reference of Social Penetration Theory for the design of NPC affinity activity content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Orientation Stage:</strong> The player and NPC have just met. The topics of conversation are relatively shallow, the NPC’s attitude is not proactive, there is little interaction, and at least one party in the conversation is relatively polite.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exploratory Affective Stage:</strong> The player and NPC begin to understand each other. There is some two-person interactive content, and they will expose themselves more in the conversation (past experiences, discussions of opinions on things), and even proactively trouble the player (implicitly inviting the player).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Affective Stage:</strong> The player and NPC become good friends. Chat topics involve more emotional attitudes (such as some deep reflections on life and emotions), more intimate two-person interactions (such as going out together), the tone becomes relaxed, and the words reveal familiarity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stable Stage:</strong> The player and NPC become close friends. The NPC becomes more proactive (when the player does not contact them, the NPC will actively contact the player). The player can trouble the NPC with more things, even including some high-value&#x2F;troublesome content (such as accepting the player’s invitation anywhere, sharing their unique skills with the player), and even have more intimate nicknames (a nickname for each other).</p>

    <title>Designing for the Real World: Game Accessibility Features (Control)</title>
    <url>/2021/10/13/netease-ux-articles/news_20211019_28584_979912/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211019/28584_979912.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The essence of games lies in setting obstacles, creating challenges, and making players feel the illusion and achievement of overcoming them all by themselves. Designing for the real world aims to serve all types of players that actually exist. Therefore, it is necessary to fully consider the unintended obstacles that players in different situations may encounter when experiencing the game, and provide them with solutions.</p>
<p>To this end, designers have added many accessibility features in the game for various players to adjust according to their own situation. Maybe you are confused about some functions when browsing some function setting interfaces in the game. This article will explain a thing or two from the control level.</p>
<p>Control represents the entire process from input to response. The first thing to consider for control is whether the interactive buttons conform to the player’s habits and ergonomics. Since gaming devices have basically taken shape after decades of development, and most game developers only make game software, game developers rarely need to consider the design of hardware. They usually pay more attention to the matching rules of buttons, the interaction methods of UI, etc.</p>
<h2 id="I-Button-Mapping-and-Operation-Methods"><a href="#I-Button-Mapping-and-Operation-Methods" class="headerlink" title="I. Button Mapping and Operation Methods"></a>I. Button Mapping and Operation Methods</h2><p>In terms of button mapping, the key layout designed for right-handed people largely does not allow left-handed players to play the game conveniently. Faced with games that cannot be remapped, players can only use “cross-handed” or squeeze their hands together for difficult operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the accessibility feature of custom button remapping has its indispensable significance.</p>
<p>Besides the key layout, players with mild paralysis and joint strain should not be ignored. Long presses, frequent taps, and other operations in combat add obstacles to them or cause muscle fatigue and other problems. Changeable operation settings can avoid this situation.</p>
<h2 id="II-Interaction-of-Music-and-Sound-Effects"><a href="#II-Interaction-of-Music-and-Sound-Effects" class="headerlink" title="II. Interaction of Music and Sound Effects"></a>II. Interaction of Music and Sound Effects</h2><p>For some players with visual impairment and sensory processing disorder (SPD), the former are more sensitive to sound, and the latter have difficulty processing complex sensory signals. Therefore, overly rich sound effects in the game may interfere with these players’ judgment of their own and other players’ status in the game.</p>
<p>Players can adjust the volume of some background music that has a shocking effect but does not benefit the battle, and increase the volume of some sound effects that prompt enemy attacks and environmental traps, so that the game experience becomes no longer difficult.</p>
<h2 id="III-Camera-and-Picture-Settings"><a href="#III-Camera-and-Picture-Settings" class="headerlink" title="III. Camera and Picture Settings"></a>III. Camera and Picture Settings</h2><p>In addition to buttons and interaction, control also covers “how to give feedback to the player when the player performs an operation.” Specifically, after we press the button, how much time does the player have to react to the next step; what changes should there be in the movement speed, camera, UI, and sound effects of the characters in the game; and how should the rules of change be communicated to the player, etc.</p>
<p>In this regard, players with motion sickness have a lot to say. When watching realistic game screens, the optic nerves of these players will feel large-amplitude and high-frequency movements. At the same time, other motion sensory organs (such as the ear vestibular apparatus) do not feel any movement. This situation is very contradictory to the nerve center, so the nerve center strongly issues a dizziness command, hoping that the body can stop and get rid of this ominous situation. In severe cases, players even vomit while playing.</p>
<p>If you have experienced motion sickness, you can probably empathize with these players.</p>
<h3 id="Switch-View"><a href="#Switch-View" class="headerlink" title="Switch View"></a>Switch View</h3><p>Players with motion sickness mostly experience dizziness when playing first-person perspective games. This is because the game screen presents the protagonist’s subjective perspective, and the picture will move with every movement of the character. At this time, the player’s eyes do not have an object to focus on accurately, and dizziness is likely to occur.</p>
<p>In the third-person perspective, players can find an object to focus on accurately in the game. Therefore, even when the camera and characters are moving, the overall change of the picture will not be as drastic as the first-person perspective, and dizziness is not easy to occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, for some games where the picture and lens may have rich changes, a flexible switching perspective can better improve the game experience of players with motion sickness and increase the player’s game time.</p>
<h3 id="Change-Field-of-View"><a href="#Change-Field-of-View" class="headerlink" title="Change Field of View"></a>Change Field of View</h3><p>The field of view determines the amount of scene information. The natural field of view of humans is 120°, while the default field of view of traditional first-person perspective games is 85-90°. In the case of a narrow field of view, the scene changes greatly, and any abrupt action may cause discomfort. Nowadays, many games have settings to adjust the range of change in the game’s field of view. In order to reduce motion sickness, players can increase the field of view. In this way, the range of scene changes when turning is reduced, and relatively speaking, it gives the brain more time to react.</p>
<h3 id="Camera-Drive"><a href="#Camera-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Camera Drive"></a>Camera Drive</h3><p>Some games, in order to create a realistic game experience, will increase the shaking of the camera in some situations, such as walking stairs and being attacked, giving people a strong stimulation, which may affect players with motion sickness to control the character normally.</p>
<p>In addition, if the perspective rotates too sensitively when the mouse is rotated, it will also make these players feel dizzy.</p>
<h3 id="Motion-Blur-Dolly-Zoom-Effect"><a href="#Motion-Blur-Dolly-Zoom-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Motion Blur &amp; Dolly Zoom Effect"></a>Motion Blur &amp; Dolly Zoom Effect</h3><h4 id="Motion-Blur"><a href="#Motion-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Motion Blur"></a>Motion Blur</h4><p>Motion blur is the moving effect in the image of a scene. It is more obvious in situations where the exposure time is long or the objects in the scene are moving fast.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to motion blur in TV or movies, so it feels unreal not to see it in moving images. In order to enhance the realism of the game, game developers often add motion blur effects.</p>
<p>The picture with motion blur will bring a strong motion effect. When the motion blur effect is reduced, the motion effect of the picture is also weakened accordingly, thereby reducing the possibility of dizziness.</p>
<h4 id="Dolly-Zoom-Effect"><a href="#Dolly-Zoom-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Dolly Zoom Effect"></a>Dolly Zoom Effect</h4><p>The Dolly zoom effect is the instant when the camera is switched while moving backward and zooming, thereby producing a disorienting effect.</p>
<p>This effect is often performed simultaneously with zoom and camera movement, but the main space in the picture remains unchanged. It is generally used to render a certain tense emotion or emphasize the environment in which the character in the picture is located. Slowly performing this process can achieve the effect of highlighting the target object; it can also be deliberately performed quickly to create an impression of disorientation, thereby causing dizziness.</p>
<p>These are all methods adopted by game designers to make the game world more realistic. However, while adding these effects, they do not forget some players with motion sickness in the real world, and set up adjustment mechanisms for them, which is truly “designing for the real world.”</p>
<h2 id="IV-Conclusion"><a href="#IV-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="IV. Conclusion"></a>IV. Conclusion</h2><p>In the process of designing games, if the designer only starts from himself or daily situations, it is difficult to comprehensively consider the needs of all players, and it is bound to discourage some people. Adding some accessibility features that are beneficial to players with disabilities to experience the game, without affecting the normal experience of other players, is precisely the meaning of “inclusiveness”. We use this to attract and accept as many player groups as possible, and open our arms to a wider world. And this is precisely the meaning of “designing for the real world.”</p>

    <title>What We Talk About When We Talk About Map Data Visualization</title>
    <url>/2021/10/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20211019_28584_979953/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211019/28584_979953.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cognitive science research shows that illustrations can help people understand knowledge faster and retain it for longer periods. In the era of big data, we have also reached a consensus: data visualization can help us gain insight into the meaning of data. Map data visualization can express the spatial relationship between data in the most intuitive form, and has capabilities that no other method has. So what is map data visualization? What are its application scenarios? What are the implementation schemes on the Web? This article will discuss these one by one, and at the end of the article, some tools for map visualization will also be introduced.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Map-Visualization-and-Its-Application-Scenarios"><a href="#What-is-Map-Visualization-and-Its-Application-Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="What is Map Visualization and Its Application Scenarios"></a>What is Map Visualization and Its Application Scenarios</h2><p>Map data visualization does not have a very official definition. It can be summarized as: Map data visualization is a data visualization method that visually presents data with geographical characteristics or analysis results on a geographic information map, which makes it easier for users to understand data patterns. The definition in words is not intuitive, and the following examples of application scenarios will make the definition easier to understand.</p>
<p>Starting from our surroundings, querying scenic spots and routes through map software (web pages) is a kind of map visualization, which visually marks locations, paths, road conditions and other information on real geographic information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F1c78154a-2945-43bd-80b1-3076fa2ba7e6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;1c78154a-2945-43bd-80b1-3076fa2ba7e6.png"></p>
<p>From a higher perspective, statistical analysis of earthquakes around the world over a period of time, the following figure marks the earthquake points on the world map, which can visually show the seismic zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F320b0e4c-a310-43a9-aec6-8b12d2037f07.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;320b0e4c-a310-43a9-aec6-8b12d2037f07.png"></p>
<p>In business activities, map visualization often appears in various reports to clearly show the distribution of data in geographic space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fef7cb52f-d744-474b-a59b-edccf0f877af.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;ef7cb52f-d744-474b-a59b-edccf0f877af.png"></p>
<p>In addition to real-world, national and other geographic information, other data visualizations related to spatial location can also be called map data visualization. For example, data visualization on a game map to show the distribution of birth points, character movement trajectories, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F4f3d3d95-d12e-46b4-924f-15590e331e06.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;4f3d3d95-d12e-46b4-924f-15590e331e06.png"></p>
<p>Through the above examples, the rules of map visualization can be summarized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map visualization uses geographic information as the base map, and uses points, lines, and surfaces to represent data on the upper layer.</li>
<li>Map visualization is usually used to represent the distribution and flow of data in geographic space.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Related-Technologies-for-Map-Data-Visualization-on-the-Web"><a href="#Related-Technologies-for-Map-Data-Visualization-on-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="Related Technologies for Map Data Visualization on the Web"></a>Related Technologies for Map Data Visualization on the Web</h2><p>Since the map uses geographic information as the base map and then adds data display of points, lines, and surfaces, the discussion of technical solutions can also be divided into two steps: geographic information base map rendering, and data layer visualization. The visualization of the data layer is basically the same as other data visualization methods, using canvas, svg or their upper-level technologies, but it is necessary to choose various projection functions to map the position to the base map. Therefore, this article will focus on the visualization technology of geographic information base maps.</p>
<p>In many systems, the geographic information base map does not actually render a map, but merely pastes a picture. The upper-level data is displayed through absolute or relative positioning, which is a visual deception, but it is effective and can save resources.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the base map in the report map mentioned earlier is composed of a series of polygons, which is a simple base map rendering method. Both Canvas and SVG in Web applications can render polygons (including curved edges).</p>
<p>Below is a visualization of an aircraft seat map. The base map is obtained through the graphic elements of SVG, and the data layer is filled with colors for the graphic elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fa7135f09-ce8a-4796-983c-e436d4e4a519.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;a7135f09-ce8a-4796-983c-e436d4e4a519.png"></p>
<p>The polygon description of maps of Chinese provinces, world countries, and other maps that we are familiar with has a unified format: GeoJSON (GeoJSON is a format for encoding various geographic data structures, a geographic spatial information data exchange format based on Javascript object notation). TopoJSON and other data formats have also been derived later. The coordinate points in GeoJSON are composed of longitude and latitude, so each piece of data in the data layer should also contain longitude, latitude, and numerical values. Some mature visualization libraries do not seem to require users to provide longitude and latitude, but actually complete the calculation internally. For example, in the following example from the Echarts official website, passing in the name of the area can complete the drawing of the data layer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F85eaa845-b673-47ec-8ae4-91576ffe664a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;85eaa845-b673-47ec-8ae4-91576ffe664a.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fcae6ced7-8749-48c4-9671-f0dedc33c552.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;cae6ced7-8749-48c4-9671-f0dedc33c552.png"></p>
<p>Similar to the earthquake distribution map in the previous section, maps that contain terrain information (need to render different heights), or as shown in the figure below, need to display spheres, need to use WebGL technology (WebGL is a JavaScript API, with a very consistent API with OpenGL ES 2.0, used for Web 3D rendering) for drawing. Mature 3D drawing libraries like Three.js are upper-level encapsulations based on WebGL. In actual use, choosing these mature underlying libraries can improve development efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F81f7f66e-1391-48db-8d5a-8cb9b6f24a61.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;81f7f66e-1391-48db-8d5a-8cb9b6f24a61.png"></p>
<p>The example of map navigation mentioned at the beginning of the article uses a high-precision base map, which is a completely different drawing technique. They may use a vector map solution, or a tile map (the tile map pyramid model is a multi-resolution hierarchical model. From the bottom to the top of the tile pyramid, the resolution becomes lower and lower, but the geographic range represented remains unchanged). When the map in the viewport is loaded in batches of rectangles, it uses the tile map technology solution. The accuracy of this type of map is much higher than that of polygon maps, and it can basically be accurate to buildings and shops. It is naturally superior to polygon maps in zooming interaction, so it is used for map data visualization with high precision requirements. The data layer also uses longitude and latitude to identify the data location. Now map service providers such as Mapbox, AutoNavi Maps, Tianditu, etc. all provide SDK for JavaScript. Mature chart libraries also encapsulate the calls of these SDKs, which are relatively convenient to use. Offline tile data can also be found online for developers to build offline map services. However, the development difficulty of this type of base map is higher than that of polygon maps, and there are different regulations on the number of calls and commercial access.</p>
<h2 id="Map-Data-Visualization-Tools"><a href="#Map-Data-Visualization-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Map Data Visualization Tools"></a>Map Data Visualization Tools</h2><h3 id="Excel"><a href="#Excel" class="headerlink" title="Excel"></a>Excel</h3><p>Excel provides map drawing functions, and Microsoft Power Map for Excel needs to be introduced. This is suitable for people who are familiar with Excel to perform static map data visualization. The usage methods of different Excel versions are not exactly the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fd0ce7d75-c135-415e-822c-bdd7fa3a0964.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;d0ce7d75-c135-415e-822c-bdd7fa3a0964.png"></p>
<h3 id="Echarts"><a href="#Echarts" class="headerlink" title="Echarts"></a>Echarts</h3><p>Echarts is a mature visualization library of js, which not only contains a small amount of 3D functions, but also uniformly provides high-precision base map API, which is suitable for most map data visualizations. Many BI platforms are implemented based on Echarts, but using Echarts requires users to have some programming skills. Programming languages such as Python and Matlab also have corresponding map visualization libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F21a095de-03b1-490f-bc52-e468976ef8dd.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;21a095de-03b1-490f-bc52-e468976ef8dd.png"></p>
<h3 id="Mapbox"><a href="#Mapbox" class="headerlink" title="Mapbox"></a>Mapbox</h3><p>Mapbox provides high-precision base map services and rich data layer drawing APIs, with highly free base map style customization, but as a lower-level map tool than Echarts, it requires higher programming skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F569b3f4c-8e66-4e7c-b268-74dfe23842f7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;569b3f4c-8e66-4e7c-b268-74dfe23842f7.png"></p>
<h3 id="Commercial-BI-such-as-NetEase-Youdata"><a href="#Commercial-BI-such-as-NetEase-Youdata" class="headerlink" title="Commercial BI such as NetEase Youdata"></a>Commercial BI such as NetEase Youdata</h3><p>Many commercial platforms provide map data visualization functions. Their functions are rich and do not require users to program, but they basically require registration and fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fe06c79e0-8e89-4d1e-840c-8a09c7dc9d5d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;e06c79e0-8e89-4d1e-840c-8a09c7dc9d5d.png"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Different data visualization methods are suitable for different information expressions. Map data visualization is suitable for expressing data distribution and flow related to geographic information. Map data visualization can be divided into two steps: base map drawing and data map drawing. Developers need to choose different technical solutions according to different needs scenarios. Data visualization has always been a method, and our real goal is to more clearly represent the information in the data through visualization.</p>

<h2 id="Basic-Introduction"><a href="#Basic-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Basic Introduction"></a>Basic Introduction</h2><p>R-Q factor analysis is a multivariate analysis method developed on the basis of R-type factor analysis and Q-type factor analysis. Its basic idea is to represent the rows (generally representing samples) and columns (generally representing variables) in the contingency table as points in a lower-dimensional space, so that more intuitive analysis can be carried out. For instance, consider a contingency table of different types of players’ purchases of items in a game:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left"></th>

<p>It can be found that when there are many categories of variables and samples under study, it is difficult to directly and intuitively reveal the relationship between variables through the contingency table. Therefore, the idea of dimensionality reduction can be used to simplify the structure of the contingency table. At this time, factor analysis will be the first thing that comes to mind. However, the disadvantage of general factor analysis is that R-type factor analysis only studies the relationship between variables, and Q-type factor analysis only studies the relationship between samples.  But in many fields, both need to be carried out at the same time. Therefore, R-Q factor analysis (also known as correspondence analysis) came into being. Correspondence analysis is to reflect the variables and the relationship between variables on a two-dimensional scatter plot. Closely related variable points are closer, while less related category points are more dispersed. By observing the corresponding distribution map, you can very intuitively feel the connection between variables, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F928333ab-68c8-46d9-960f-b5314902f8cb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;928333ab-68c8-46d9-960f-b5314902f8cb.png"></p>
<h2 id="Method-Principle"><a href="#Method-Principle" class="headerlink" title="Method Principle"></a>Method Principle</h2><p>Because the theory of this method is more complicated and involves a lot of formulas, due to space limitations, this article does not involve the principle, and only briefly introduces the calculation process. Skipping it does not affect the subsequent practical part.</p>
<p>First, convert the contingency table matrix to a probability matrix, where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fa291bd8e-19d8-4c8f-9409-e7ae235948a3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;a291bd8e-19d8-4c8f-9409-e7ae235948a3.png"></p>
<p>Through transformation, the probability matrix P is obtained:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fb8e3a85d-bb91-4f4f-9f70-3070e3e33d9d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;b8e3a85d-bb91-4f4f-9f70-3070e3e33d9d.png"></p>
<p>Then, the transition matrix Z is obtained by standardizing the probability matrix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fdd9fe4a3-8ce4-4fdf-b275-469182e8644d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;dd9fe4a3-8ce4-4fdf-b275-469182e8644d.png"></p>
<p>Therefore, the covariance matrix A of variables and the covariance matrix B of samples are respectively:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F523a7364-111a-4cdf-a21d-5fc97de6e516.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;523a7364-111a-4cdf-a21d-5fc97de6e516.png"></p>
<p>Next, calculate the factor loading matrices F and G of R-type and Q-type respectively. They are respectively:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fe3b4e182-d4fb-4a78-8f92-fef880bc09f9.png/size/" alt="Factor Loading Matrices"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fcc169f88-f74f-43cb-aac7-70683e6bc0ad.png/size/" alt="Factor Loading Matrices"></p>
<p>Where λi is the eigenvalue of matrices A and B, and ui and vi are the eigenvectors of matrices A and B.</p>
<p>According to the theorem, matrices A and B have exactly the same non-zero eigenvalues, and these eigenvalues are the variances of each common factor. Therefore, the same factor axis can be used to represent variable points and sample points at the same time. Therefore, F and G are respectively regarded as p two-dimensional points and n two-dimensional points are drawn in a common coordinate plane, forming a corresponding distribution map, which can intuitively see the connection between various categories.</p>
<h2 id="R-Language-Practical-Application"><a href="#R-Language-Practical-Application" class="headerlink" title="R Language Practical Application"></a>R Language Practical Application</h2><p>Although the theory of R-Q factor analysis is more complicated, its use in R language is very simple, and it can be completed in three steps:</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Install-the-R-language-package-‘ca’-and-load-it"><a href="#Step-1-Install-the-R-language-package-‘ca’-and-load-it" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install the R language package ‘ca’ and load it"></a>Step 1: Install the R language package ‘ca’ and load it</h3><p>Enter the code <code>install.packages(&#39;ca&#39;)</code> in the command line to complete the installation.</p>
<p>Then load the package with the code <code>library(&#39;ca&#39;)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Read-the-data"><a href="#Step-2-Read-the-data" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Read the data"></a>Step 2: Read the data</h3><p>If it is a csv file, it can be completed by file reading code</p>
<p><code>data &lt;- read.csv(“path/filename.csv”, header= T)</code></p>
<h3 id="Step-3-R-language-modeling-and-drawing"><a href="#Step-3-R-language-modeling-and-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: R language modeling and drawing"></a>Step 3: R language modeling and drawing</h3><p>Model with code <code>result &lt;- ca(data)</code></p>
<p>Then draw with the code <code>plot(result)</code>, and the corresponding distribution map is drawn successfully!</p>
<p>At the same time, in the output results, we need to pay more attention to the indicator Principal inertias (eigenvalues), which represents the contribution rate of each eigenvalue. Since we finally need the largest two eigenvalues as two dimensions for the corresponding graph display, the larger the first two eigenvalues, the higher the contribution, and the more it can analyze the real information of the data. Our example is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F4c053811-f28d-4118-896f-03f4a439ee1f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;4c053811-f28d-4118-896f-03f4a439ee1f.png"></p>
<p>It can be seen that the first two eigenvalues can explain 86.01% of the data, which is a very good result.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>R-Q factor analysis has many application scenarios. It can be used to analyze the preferences of different types of players for game props and different gameplays, and can be well used in cross-recommendation; it can also analyze the preferences of users from different channels for different types of games, assist in the rational use of channel resources, and thus better promote channels; it can also analyze various dimensions among players of different occupations and different age groups. R-Q factor analysis has the following advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can reveal the relationship between row variables and column variables</li>
<li>Intuitively express the relationship between multi-dimensional variables in a two-dimensional graph</li>
<li>The operation and implementation are relatively simple</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I hope everyone can gain something from this article and apply R-Q factor analysis to work and study practice!</p>

    <title>The Significance of Measuring Sample Size: Wilson Score</title>
    <url>/2021/09/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20211019_28584_980012/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211019/28584_980012.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In user questionnaire analysis, sometimes we face a situation:</p>
<p>Fashion A: 8 out of 13 players voted “like,” 5 voted “dislike.”<br>Fashion B: 16 out of 28 players “like,” 12 “dislike.”<br>Fashion C: 135 out of 270 players “like,” 135 “dislike.”</p>
<p>At this point, how should we choose which fashion is more popular with players?</p>
<p>Method 1: Look at the net “like” count, i.e., “like” count - “dislike” count. In this case, Fashion B should be the most popular.</p>
<p>Method 2: Look at the “like” rate, i.e., “like” count &#x2F; (“like” count + “dislike” count). In this case, Fashion A should be the most popular.</p>
<p>Is there perhaps a more convincing method?</p>
<p>Besides wondering why so many people filled out the questionnaire for Fashion C, while only a few people filled it out for Fashions A and B, this problem actually contains knowledge about sample size and statistics. One solution to this problem is the Wilson score, which cleverly applies the knowledge of statistical interval estimation to content evaluation, combining sample size and player evaluation to obtain a fairer and more effective evaluation score.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F003512c1-d39d-4d7a-9429-673e01246058.png/size/" alt="Outfits from Naraka Bladepoint"></p>

<h2 id="What-is-the-Wilson-Score"><a href="#What-is-the-Wilson-Score" class="headerlink" title="What is the Wilson Score?"></a>What is the Wilson Score?</h2><p>Strictly speaking, the Wilson score can be called the lower bound of the confidence interval for the binomial distribution interval estimation. It makes the following assumptions about players’ voting behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player’s vote is an independent event.</li>
<li>Players’ voting results are only “like” and “dislike”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under such assumptions, voting “like” or “dislike” is transformed into a binomial distribution in probability. By collecting player questionnaires, we can estimate the player’s “like” rate <em>p</em> for a certain outfit. That is, in <em>n</em> independent votes, there are <em>k</em> votes for “like”. By using the actual values of <em>n</em> and <em>k</em>, we can evaluate the relationship between <em>k&#x2F;n</em> and <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, when <em>n</em> is larger, <em>k&#x2F;n</em> will be closer to <em>p</em>, and when <em>n</em> is smaller, the result of <em>k&#x2F;n</em> may lack persuasiveness.</p>
<p>Confidence intervals and interval estimation are a type of parameter estimation. For example, regarding the player’s preference rate <em>p</em> for a certain fashion item, unless we ask every player if they really like a certain fashion item, we can never get all players’ opinions on a certain fashion item. Therefore, we need to analyze the results of the questionnaires already obtained to infer the relationship between the player’s questionnaire preference rate <em>k&#x2F;n</em> and the player’s true preference rate <em>p</em> in the existing results. Since it is an inference or estimation, there are two situations: overestimation and underestimation. The entire interval connecting underestimation and overestimation is interval estimation. In contrast, point estimation only estimates one result.</p>
<h2 id="Wilson-Score-Calculation"><a href="#Wilson-Score-Calculation" class="headerlink" title="Wilson Score Calculation"></a>Wilson Score Calculation</h2><p>The Wilson score formula is as follows (Wikipedia: Binomial proportion confidence interval):</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fb512aa83-d416-44de-9075-2cfc8bfbe696.png/size/" alt="Wilson Score Formula"></p>
<p>Where <em>n</em> is the sample size, i.e., the total number of votes;</p>
<p><em>p</em> is the “like” rate of the questionnaire players, <em>k&#x2F;n</em>;</p>
<p><em>z</em> is the standard normal distribution statistic for a certain confidence interval, which can be obtained by looking up the table, usually taking 1.96.</p>
<p>From the score formula, we can find that the Wilson score adjusts the original simple calculation method of <em>k&#x2F;n</em> with the sample size <em>n</em>, making the result fairer:</p>
<p>When the sample size is small, this value will tend to be smaller;<br>When the sample size is large, this value will keep approaching the actual data result of <em>k&#x2F;n</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, this value formula is the lower bound of the confidence interval for the interval estimation of the binomial distribution parameter <em>p</em>. The lower bound, as the name suggests, is an underestimation of the parameter to be estimated. Only with strong evidence can we face up to the results of, for example, 95% or 99% preference rate generated from the questionnaire. Otherwise, under a small statistical sample size, the 95% preference rate will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>In addition, sometimes it may be necessary to overestimate certain values. For example, based on the principle of prudence, overestimating the future player churn rate, we can choose the upper bound of the confidence interval:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fbcb729ee-9898-46c0-ba73-ac1fafd99974.png/size/" alt="Upper Bound"></p>
<p>This algorithm was proposed in 1927 by a middle-aged man named Wilson.</p>
<p>In the same year, another elderly man named Wilson won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on microscopic particles.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Game-IP-Crossover"><a href="#What-is-Game-IP-Crossover" class="headerlink" title="What is Game IP Crossover?"></a>What is Game IP Crossover?</h2><p>IP is the abbreviation of Intellectual Property, which is actually the legal concept of “intellectual property.” In the network context, the concept of IP is broader. Generally speaking, a cultural brand that can be independently disseminated on multiple platforms, developed in multiple dimensions, and realized for commercial monetization will be called an IP. IP usually has a complete worldview and values, with three basic characteristics: first, the diversity of forms of literary and artistic works; second, the hierarchical complexity of operating methods; and third, profound influence in social life. In other words, IP is actually a kind of word-of-mouth communication. It does not need to rely on advertising and marketing to achieve effective interpersonal publicity, and it can quickly gather audiences with similar worldviews and values, and even form a culture.</p>
<p>Such a desirable commodity will naturally not be missed by the game industry. IP crossover is now a major trend in the gaming world. In games, IP crossover usually takes the following forms:</p>
<h3 id="Crossovers-in-the-Same-Field"><a href="#Crossovers-in-the-Same-Field" class="headerlink" title="Crossovers in the Same Field"></a>Crossovers in the Same Field</h3><p>Crossovers in the same field, that is, crossovers between game IPs and game IPs. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which was very popular upon release, had a crossover with <em>Onmyoji</em>. Specifically, the crossover between <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and <em>Onmyoji</em> is a more common character crossover, adding <em>Onmyoji</em>‘s popular character Yoto Hime as a new hero to the game, and launching a series of <em>Onmyoji</em> crossover weapons and skins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2F4dc5e347-b2e0-41e1-9668-f507193cdf8c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;4dc5e347-b2e0-41e1-9668-f507193cdf8c.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fdbb1dace-9ba6-48b0-a253-d6a9f619f396.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;dbb1dace-9ba6-48b0-a253-d6a9f619f396.png"></p>
<p>Some game crossovers, in addition to appearance and character crossovers, will also bring their own gameplay, plot&#x2F;character settings into other games.</p>
<h3 id="Cross-Field-Crossovers"><a href="#Cross-Field-Crossovers" class="headerlink" title="Cross-Field Crossovers"></a>Cross-Field Crossovers</h3><p>There is also a cross-field crossover, such as a film-game crossover. Crossovers between games and film and television dramas, animations, novels, etc. are all counted in this large category. Specific crossover forms include the adaptation of film and television works into mobile games, and the simultaneous release of film and television dramas and games to promote the game through the popularity of film and television. For example, the crossover between the <em>Justice Online</em> PC game and the TV series <em>Ordinary Glory</em> is a very good crossover case. In the TV series, the behind-the-scenes story of how the <em>Justice Online</em> development team, in the face of the pressure of huge R&amp;D costs, adhered to the original intention of developing high-quality PC games in the turbulent wave of the PC game market, was included. It lets more audiences know the hardships of the staff behind the game through TV series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211019%2Fae95bb61-cc63-4de7-b01a-00a12986ae41.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211019&#x2F;ae95bb61-cc63-4de7-b01a-00a12986ae41.png"></p>
<h2 id="Why-Crossover-IPs"><a href="#Why-Crossover-IPs" class="headerlink" title="Why Crossover IPs?"></a>Why Crossover IPs?</h2><p>Attracting new users and increasing revenue and engagement are eternal propositions for games. The emergence of IP crossover promotion methods is also closely related to this. From the perspective of attracting new users, as the penetration rate of game users increases, the cost of acquiring new game users through traditional methods will also become higher and higher. Because IP itself has high cultural vitality, when using IP for publicity, it can be spread more easily and save promotion costs. On the other hand, the audience of the IP itself may also be transformed into game players, achieving the effect of acquiring new users from other fields.</p>
<p>From the perspective of promoting engagement, large IPs themselves have a broad mass base, which may highly overlap with the player groups in the game. Crossovering with IPs will undoubtedly excite these old players and increase their stickiness to the game. Some original lost players may also return due to IP activities. For non-IP audiences, it can also increase the novelty of the game. Furthermore, good crossover events may also bring self-propagation among players, bring more users, and the game’s revenue will naturally increase.</p>
<h2 id="What-Role-Does-User-Research-Play-in-IP-Crossovers"><a href="#What-Role-Does-User-Research-Play-in-IP-Crossovers" class="headerlink" title="What Role Does User Research Play in IP Crossovers?"></a>What Role Does User Research Play in IP Crossovers?</h2><p>IP Crossover sounds like a marketing-oriented content, so what role can user research play in it?</p>
<p>First, it’s the choice of IP. Although IP is good, the value of the IP itself and the degree of fit between the IP and the game may not be high. A good IP is either one that has a wide enough audience, so no matter what game it crosses over with, it can cover a part of the population. But this type of IP is expensive and everyone is scrambling for it. Not to mention the cost-effectiveness, the cooperation may not even be negotiated. The other is that its audience highly overlaps with a certain game, and the user similarity is extremely high, so the players will have a higher acceptance of the worldview, character settings, etc. It is not easy to have problems, and it may also achieve the effect of small cost and large income. The user research department can help the product conduct research on all these issues at an early stage.</p>
<p>When an intended IP has been selected:</p>
<p>① UE can conduct desk research to investigate the player characteristics and audience range of the target IP, and create a user persona of IP fans, helping to screen the fit between the IP and the game itself.</p>
<p>② On the other hand, it can also investigate what classic elements the IP itself has, and what are the most famous&#x2F;most nostalgic events, to help determine the content suitable for crossover.</p>
<p>③ In addition, UE can also conduct research on existing players in the game to understand players’ awareness and acceptance of the IP, and avoid possible risks after the crossover. No matter what, it is very counterproductive for old players to disapprove of the crossover IP. Old players should at least have a neutral attitude towards the IP.</p>
<p>Of course, when no intended IP has been selected, UE can also conduct research to understand what IP players most want to crossover with, and how different IPs are favored by game players.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the crossover event has been launched, UE often comprehensively tracks the crossover effect through public opinion monitoring, questionnaire tracking, data analysis, telephone surveys, and other methods. For example, how do we know who are fan players and how do they feel about the game? And which part of the fans has a good conversion effect and can increase publicity, and which fans have a poor conversion effect? The user research department can tag players with fan labels and source labels when they enter the game, regularly track all data of these players in the game, and combine qualitative research methods to understand their true inner thoughts.</p>
<p>There are many other things that user research can do in IP crossovers, including but not limited to: new user acquisition effect prediction of the crossover, new fan player persona, fan retention analysis, crossover event analysis, external public opinion tracking, fan communication characteristics analysis… Of course, don’t forget that regular tracking and risk assessment of old players are very important.</p>
<p>In summary, IP crossover is both an opportunity and a risk. Only by truly doing user research well is it responsible for the game.</p>

<p>“Devs, this class is too weak, it’s basically a bottom-tier class, please buff it.” “Devs, the damage output of the XX class is too low, I don’t want to be a tickle monster anymore.” In players’ daily game experience feedback, feedback about class strength has always accounted for a high proportion.</p>
<p>Game designers are often very cautious about adjusting the skill values of classes, because adjusting one class will also affect other classes, and the balance of the entire game’s classes may be affected. Moreover, the strength of classes cannot be adjusted frequently. It is impossible to nerf one day, buff a little the next day, and then nerf again the day after. Therefore, when making decisions about class adjustments, it is necessary to rely on the analysis of massive game data, and it is definitely not “distribution according to noise”. So how do designers make decisions based on these “voices of the people” from players, and whether to adjust the strength of a certain class that players feedback?</p>
<p>This article will share with you the reasons why “players feedback that a certain class is too weak” discovered in previous class-related research. As well as the common adjustment ideas that designers have for some class strength problems.</p>
<p>First, let’s break down the process of a player experiencing a new class and forming an opinion on the strength of the class:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-experience Expectation Setting:</strong> Players have expectations for a class before playing.</li>
<li><strong>Inital Perceived Strength:</strong> Comparing play experience to initial expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Usage Comprehension:</strong> Determining understanding and execution of skill usage.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Growth &amp; Allocation:</strong> Developing an understanding of class building.</li>
<li><strong>Actual Combat Strength:</strong> Gauging actual combat performance based on the above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many times, players and even researchers will be preconceived to think that the problem lies in the last step, that is, there is a problem with the numerical settings of the class itself, resulting in the output not being able to be hit or being easily killed. Therefore, suggestions such as increasing class damage are often given. But in fact, problems in any of the above steps will cause players to have a wrong judgment on the strength of the class. According to the breakdown of each process, we can divide the problem into the following 4 categories:</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-1-Disparity-Experience-Caused-by-Overly-High-Expectations-Deviation-in-Cognitive-Strength-of-Class-Role"><a href="#Problem-Type-1-Disparity-Experience-Caused-by-Overly-High-Expectations-Deviation-in-Cognitive-Strength-of-Class-Role" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 1: Disparity Experience Caused by Overly High Expectations &#x2F; Deviation in Cognitive Strength of Class Role"></a>Problem Type 1: Disparity Experience Caused by Overly High Expectations &#x2F; Deviation in Cognitive Strength of Class Role</h2><p>This problem occurs in steps 1 and 2. The reason for the problem is often that the strength and output ability of the new class are described too strongly in the early class promotion, or the role is not clearly introduced, which will make players have too high expectations for the strength of this class before the experience. After the actual experience, it is found that the strength of the class is not as high as expected, and there is an obvious sense of disparity.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> has a class called <em>Yingling</em> with 3 forms. The 3 forms are melee output, ranged output, and healing support. In the early promotion, the switching of the 3 states, as well as the characteristics of melee, ranged, burst output and healing, were emphasized. Before the experience, players easily think that this class is an all-round ACE class that can be melee, ranged output, heal, and buff. But in fact, these 3 forms cannot be switched freely. Due to the long CD, in a battle, it is expected to switch only 2-3 times. It is impossible for the player to switch to a healing state to heal themself at any time and then switch back to output. The design expectation of this class was never an all-round class. The advantage of this class is that it allows players to adapt to more scene needs and freely choose their preferred class.</p>
<p>Without understanding the actual positioning of the class, after the actual experience, players find that the output of this new class is not top-notch, and the support is not necessary, and the positioning is very awkward. So a lot of negative feedback appeared. This is a typical problem caused by excessive expectations and deviations in the cognitive strength of the class role.</p>
<p>For this type of problem, what needs to be adjusted is not the strength of the class, but to start with the player’s expectation management.</p>
<p>So how do we generally locate this type of problem? In addition to qualitative player feedback, our commonly used quantitative diagnostic method is to understand the player’s expected strength and actual experience strength through a questionnaire to see if there is an obvious gap between the two.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-2-Misunderstanding-of-Class-Skills-or-Misuse-of-Core-Skill-Rotation"><a href="#Problem-Type-2-Misunderstanding-of-Class-Skills-or-Misuse-of-Core-Skill-Rotation" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 2: Misunderstanding of Class Skills or Misuse of Core Skill Rotation"></a>Problem Type 2: Misunderstanding of Class Skills or Misuse of Core Skill Rotation</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 3. For example, the newly released <em>Yantian</em> class in <em>Revelation M</em>. To achieve one-shot headshot damage, you need to first stack bleeding layers with basic attacks. Each layer of bleeding can bring additional damage. The more damage layers, the higher the damage. Then use two damage-increasing skills, and then use sniper to deal massive damage. Some players just started playing and don’t know this kind of play style. They add two states when they meet and start sniping. The damage will be greatly reduced, and then feedback that Yantian is a tickle monster.</p>
<p>For this type of problem that causes players to think that the class is too weak, it is necessary to improve it by strengthening the guidance of class output methods. Sometimes designers will also actively simplify the output routine to reduce the player’s cognitive burden. For example, for classes that stack states, originally only two specific skills could be used to stack states, and now any output skill can be used to stack states, simplifying the output cycle. In this type of problem, in addition to the problem that the above output cycle is not correct, misunderstanding the core output skills is also a common situation.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, the quantitative data we generally use is the frequency of player skill use in dungeons or PVP gameplay to see whether the player’s skill use is inconsistent with expectations, and whether the wrong skills are used. Some classes that need to apply statuses will also use status-related data to diagnose whether the player is correctly applying statuses.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-3-Wrong-Class-Development-Direction"><a href="#Problem-Type-3-Wrong-Class-Development-Direction" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 3: Wrong Class Development Direction"></a>Problem Type 3: Wrong Class Development Direction</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 4. For example, the <em>Yingling</em> class in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> mentioned above, if the main form is <em>Yueming</em>. In <em>Yueming</em>‘s core output cycle, immobilization is a very important part. One is because this control is brought by the core skill, and the other is that immobilization is needed to ensure that the output cycle is played smoothly. Then for players who play the <em>Yueming</em> form of <em>Yingling</em>, the immobilization attribute must be high. But in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, immobilization is not the mainstream control attribute, and generally people will not focus on it. Therefore, many players who feedback that <em>Yueming</em>‘s output is weak are found to have low immobilization. In addition to the above classes with clear attribute emphasis. Classes with different types of output methods will also have different attribute emphases. Burst-type output, stacking critical strikes and critical damage will have high returns, and can achieve one-shot kills, and critical strikes are guaranteed profits. Stable output type classes, stacking attack will have relatively higher returns, improving the overall output level. Therefore, if the core attributes of the class are not correct, it will also lead to the expected strength of the class not being able to be well exerted.</p>
<p>The solution to this type of problem is generally to guide ordinary players through official guides or guides from top players. And the attribute leaderboards in the game also play a certain guiding role. Ordinary players can also learn the core attributes of the class by viewing the attributes of top players on the leaderboards. Because of this, after the launch of a new class, players will be allowed to experience it for 1-2 weeks before they really start to adjust the strength. It is necessary to let players familiarize themselves with the skills and point allocation methods. If the class is strengthened based on the winning rate data of players’ experience in a few days. It is easy to appear that after players are familiar with the skills and improve their training level, the class strength increases by a level, and they have to face a nerf, which will bring a more negative experience.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, you can directly pull out the attribute value data of players of each class, and you can intuitively see the attribute allocation emphasis of each class and whether it is correct.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-Type-4-Class-Strength-Problems-Output-Environment-Problems"><a href="#Problem-Type-4-Class-Strength-Problems-Output-Environment-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problem Type 4: Class Strength Problems&#x2F;Output Environment Problems"></a>Problem Type 4: Class Strength Problems&#x2F;Output Environment Problems</h2><p>This problem occurs in step 5. The problems in the previous steps are more problems of player understanding and cognition, rather than the real problem of class design itself. If the previous problems are ruled out, and the player can play the class routine and cultivate attributes as expected by the designer, and the class performance is still poor, then it is necessary to consider the problem of the class itself.</p>
<p>But even if it is the problem of the class itself, many times it is not simply solved by increasing skill damage.</p>
<p>Before the launch of a new class, designers will conduct a lot of tests, and generally there will not be too much difference in numerical values from expectations. But what is not easily covered by internal testing is: the complex and changeable battle situation in the gameplay, and various dungeons with different mechanisms. For example, in a 1v1 battle situation, when the situation is relatively simple, the output can easily play its own output cycle. But once it comes to team battles or 5v5, the output will face the situation of being focused by multiple opponents. Coupled with control, the output environment is very poor, and it is difficult to play the expected output. In addition, most of the designers are top players, and they are often prone to overestimate the player’s reaction time and operating level, designing an operation cycle that requires too high operations, resulting in the real situation after the official launch, players can’t use it, or in other words, in a real and changeable environment, this kind of operation cycle is difficult to use smoothly.</p>
<p>This type of problem is often not solved by simply increasing the damage value, but by optimizing the output environment or reducing the output operation. For example, for classes with many skill combos or requiring stacking states, this core output cycle is relatively long. In actual combat, it is easy to be interrupted, resulting in the output not being able to be played. This situation is generally improved by enhancing the super armor (cannot be interrupted and controlled during the output process) or enhancing the control (first control the opponent to ensure that their output is not easy to be interrupted). Or reduce the duration of stacking states, such as originally needing to stack 15 layers to deal high damage, reduced to stacking 10 layers.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of this type of problem, you can look at the actual values of the class in the dungeon or PK to see whether the class performance meets expectations. Common indicators are: total output, DPS (output should have the appearance of output), damage taken, healing; number of kills (whether it has the demeanor of a main C), number of kills (survival environment). For example, to see whether the output of an output class is up to standard, in PK, the output and number of kills of the output class will be ranked among other classes to see if it meets the design expectations; in dungeons, DPS will be looked at. The DPS value can easily show whether there is a gap between the actual output capability and the expected output capability of the output class.</p>
<p>In summary, when a player feeds back that their class is too weak, it is not necessarily a problem with the class design itself. It is necessary to first judge whether the player has cognitive biases and is unfamiliar with class skills and attribute allocation. Only by finding the root of the problem can we “prescribe the right medicine”.</p>

    <title>Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance: Translation Design in Naraka: Bladepoint</title>
    <url>/2021/10/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20211026_28584_981752/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211026/28584_981752.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the depths of your mind, do you envision a dashing young man traveling the world with a sword? We may know about <em>wuxia</em> (武侠 - martial heroes) from the literary works of masters like Jin Yong (金庸) and Gu Long (古龙). Weaponry, martial arts, rare treasures, and love and hate are all things that people in the <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - martial arts world) care about most.</p>
<p>In today’s rapidly developing technology, games, as a new form of literary expression, have entered the world stage. And <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is one such authentic <em>wuxia</em>-style work, carrying the Chinese people’s innate pursuit of “freedom of the self” in the martial arts spirit, and conveying this spirit and culture to game lovers all over the world. So, for us, the first difficulty to overcome in overseas localization is how to translate the <em>wuxia</em> flavor in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> authentically?</p>
<h2 id="Faithfulness-Expressiveness-and-Elegance-信达雅-xin-da-ya"><a href="#Faithfulness-Expressiveness-and-Elegance-信达雅-xin-da-ya" class="headerlink" title="Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance (信达雅 - xìn dá yǎ)"></a>Faithfulness, Expressiveness, and Elegance (信达雅 - xìn dá yǎ)</h2><p>The translation rules of “faithfulness,” “expressiveness,” and “elegance” were proposed by Yan Fu (严复), a prominent enlightenment thinker in late Qing Dynasty China. In the “Introduction to Translation” of <em>Evolution and Ethics</em>, he said: “There are three difficulties in translation: faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance. It is already very difficult to achieve faithfulness! However, if it is faithful but not expressive, although it is translated, it is as if it is not translated, so expressiveness is still important.”</p>
<p>“Faithfulness” means that the meaning does not deviate from the original text, that is, the translation should be accurate, not deviate, not omit, and not add or subtract meaning at will; “expressiveness” means not being constrained by the original form, and the translation is smooth and clear; “elegance” means that the words used in the translation should be appropriate, pursuing the elegance and simplicity of the text itself.</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, the translation should conform to the characteristics of the Chinese language, pay attention to the integrity of a sentence, that is, content, structure, and style, that is, the accuracy of the content, the smoothness of the grammatical structure, and the literary grace of the language carrier. Taking Vietnamese localization as an example, the following will introduce how we design and adjust on the road of “faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance”.</p>
<h3 id="Faithfulness-Accuracy-The-“Vast-Sea”-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Faithfulness-Accuracy-The-“Vast-Sea”-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Faithfulness: Accuracy - The “Vast Sea” Case in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>Faithfulness: Accuracy - The “Vast Sea” Case in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h3><p>Many terms in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> use Chinese allusions, such as the “Vast Sea” (瀚海 - <em>hàn hǎi</em>) that we will mention next. The meaning of “Vast Sea” has changed drastically with the changes of history.</p>
<p>During the Han and Six Dynasties, “Vast Sea” was the name of a northern sea. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Huo Qubing attacked the Xiongnu’s left territory, went out of Dai County for more than two thousand miles, and returned after reaching the Vast Sea. By the Tang Dynasty, this term was transformed into a general term for the vast areas north of the Gobi Desert on the Mongolian Plateau and its westward extension to the Junggar Basin. Gao Shi, a frontier poet of the Tang Dynasty, wrote in “Song of Yan”: “The lieutenant’s feather book flies to the Vast Sea, and the Chanyu’s hunting fire illuminates the Wolf Mountain.”</p>
<p>In the game, we also have related terms: “Wind of the Vast Sea*”. This is also a challenge for our translation team. Is this wind blowing from the sea? Or from the desert? In order to accurately translate the meaning of the term, we compared the art resources inside the game and confirmed that the term corresponds to Canaan’s desert-style skin. Combining with the meaning of the term, we gave an accurate translation.</p>

In the early stage, we directly translated <em>tachi</em> into “Thái Đao” (the Sino-Vietnamese word for <em>tachi</em>).</p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211026%2F9b3d4418-82be-438c-8217-40a76dde7cbd.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211026&#x2F;9b3d4418-82be-438c-8217-40a76dde7cbd.png"></h2><h2 id="Figure-2-The-Vietnamese-term-for-tachi-does-exist"><a href="#Figure-2-The-Vietnamese-term-for-tachi-does-exist" class="headerlink" title="Figure 2.

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. There are 18.5 million search results for searching “Thái Đao”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the launch, we never expected that the translation of this word would become the focus of discussion in the community that day.</p>
<p>In the Vietnamese understanding, <em>tachi</em> is a sword. So players had a heated discussion about whether <em>tachi</em> is a “dao” (刀 - knife&#x2F;sabre) or a “kiem” (剑 - sword). Since “太” and “泰” (Thai) are homophones in Sino-Vietnamese, new players raised new questions: Why is <em>tachi</em> from Thailand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211026%2F068620b9-00ce-45c7-b654-f634db9f985f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211026&#x2F;068620b9-00ce-45c7-b654-f634db9f985f.png"></p>

<h2 id="Figure-4-Tachi引发玩家无数讨论的太刀-Tachi-that-sparked-countless-discussions-among-players"><a href="#Figure-4-Tachi引发玩家无数讨论的太刀-Tachi-that-sparked-countless-discussions-among-players" class="headerlink" title="Figure 4.

Tachi引发玩家无数讨论的太刀</em> (Tachi that sparked countless discussions among players)</h2><p>At first, we were also nervous about this public opinion, fearing that players would be dissatisfied with our translation professionalism. But because Vietnamese is a modifier-head language structure, the grammatical confusion that “Thai knife” may cause is actually very small. In addition, “Thái” has the meaning of slender and narrow in Vietnamese. After discussing it on their own for a day, players expressed their recognition and understanding of our translation version.</p>
<p>In such a positive and active communication, we are very happy to have such a group of players in the community who care about the details of the game. As the saying goes, the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, and the same is true for translation. Whether it is for our localization colleagues or players, <em>tachi</em> has left a deep impression on our hearts.</p>
<h3 id="Elegance-Beauty-The-Wuxia-Style-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#Elegance-Beauty-The-Wuxia-Style-Case-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="Elegance: Beauty - The Wuxia Style Case in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>Elegance: Beauty - The Wuxia Style Case in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h3><p>When novices first enter the game, we will be awakened by the Yin God as Ning Hongye, and then enter the novice teaching of climbing and collecting. The first few sentences in this stage are carefully designed. We adjusted the game translation content to a concise Gu Long style, using short sentences and imperative sentences, so that players can feel a chilling atmosphere as soon as they enter the game, instantly mobilizing the player’s adrenaline. Another advantage of this design is that it allows players to get clear guidance in the novice period, ensuring that information is delivered clearly and accurately.</p>
<h2 id="nbsp-2"><a href="#nbsp-2" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211026%2F349902bf-c545-4b85-9cf5-5bfc4332df3d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211026&#x2F;349902bf-c545-4b85-9cf5-5bfc4332df3d.png"></h2><h2 id="Figure-5-Gu-Long’s-novels-are-wuxia-classics"><a href="#Figure-5-Gu-Long’s-novels-are-wuxia-classics" class="headerlink" title="Figure 5. Gu Long’s novels are wuxia classics"></a><em>Figure 5. Gu Long’s novels are wuxia classics</em></h2><p>In addition, we also adjusted the translation style for different characters. For example, there are many differences in the style of writing in the background stories of Kurumi and Canaan. In Kurumi’s speech, we used a lot of exclamations and cute words to highlight the character’s innocence and cleverness.</p>

If these three points can be achieved, this game will build a bridge for overseas players, remove the obstacles and barriers of language, and allow us to jointly feel this martial arts world.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Do you remember how we started a multiplayer journey in the game? Sometimes it’s a team invitation from a powerful friend, sometimes it’s a teammate recruitment shout in the public channel, and sometimes it’s just a stranger we meet in the open world with the same goal… In most multiplayer games, the team system is often an important part of the game’s social composition and is closely related to the player’s game experience - good teammates will bring a refreshing and pleasant experience, and at the same time enhance the positive social interaction between players and may develop into new friend relationships, that is, to obtain the joy of the game through a good cooperation.</p>
<p>From the player’s point of view, the team system is a natural connection between the battle and friend systems. When we analyze the underlying logic of the team system from the perspective of game design, we may find some more interesting design constructs.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Social-Ecology-of-Games"><a href="#1-The-Social-Ecology-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Social Ecology of Games"></a>1. The Social Ecology of Games</h2><p>First of all, what is the social ecology in the game? From the perspective of psychological design, the social ecology of the game is essentially a psychological need of players. In the classic Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, Maslow divides human needs from low to high into physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs. Through a series of interactions such as environmental mapping and behavioral feedback in the game world, players can obtain a sense of belonging and self-esteem that transcends real time and space.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffc6c0412-deed-44e8-a5e2-e8427268840a.png/size/" alt="Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs."></p>
<p>From the perspective of game design, the team system, friend system and battle matching system can be combined to build a basic game social ecosystem. A good social ecosystem design can bring higher player retention and a more stable social relationship cycle to the game, thereby improving the overall revenue of the game.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-is-a-Team-System"><a href="#2-What-is-a-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="2. What is a Team System?"></a>2. What is a Team System?</h2><p>The team system is an important part of the game’s social ecosystem construction. It is closely related to the friend system and the battle matching system, two core systems.</p>
<p>The type of game and the characteristics of the core gameplay will also be reflected in the design of the team system. For example, some games pay more attention to matching cooperation (such as <em>Overwatch</em>), so its team system will pay more attention to functionality, while some games pay more attention to the fun of the gameplay (such as <em>Warframe</em>), so its team system will pay more attention to sociality and be more closely integrated with the friend system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unlike random matching that directly enters the battle, the team system allows players to form or join a team according to specific needs, and there will be an adjustment and consensus process within the team, so that players have a greater sense of belonging in cooperative battles. It is a process of finding and recognizing each other, and sometimes it can also avoid the problem of inappropriate position selection caused by random matching, which is different from the fast game experience of directly pulling players into the team through matching.</p>
<p>In general, a good team system can promote player socialization and enhance the game experience of battle cooperation, which has an important positive impact on player retention.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Based-Teaming"><a href="#Social-Based-Teaming" class="headerlink" title="Social-Based Teaming"></a>Social-Based Teaming</h3><p>At present, there are two main ways to team up in cooperative competitive games. One is to rely on the team-up method of friends, which is more social, but also more costly for players, because the team system limits the relationship between players and teammates to friends. The advantage is that the matching and cooperation experience between relatively familiar players is more stable and it is easy to enhance feelings; the disadvantage is that the cost of developing stranger friends is higher.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F5b38d977-199c-4cd4-97f3-c2b60b909b28.png/size/" alt="Example Image. Image shows a friends-based team system."></p>
<h3 id="Quick-Teaming"><a href="#Quick-Teaming" class="headerlink" title="Quick Teaming"></a>Quick Teaming</h3><p>Another way is an independent team system, which allows players to quickly join a team with the same mission goals through some filtering conditions, which is slightly weaker in sociality but more convenient. The advantage is that the game experience of cooperation is smoother and faster, and the cost of getting to know stranger friends is lower; the disadvantage is that it is relatively more likely to find inappropriate teammates, which affects the game experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F812bbf30-0942-4f82-a7b2-d47fabe76651.png/size/" alt="Example Image. Image shows a quick-team based system."></p>
<h2 id="3-Application-of-Team-System-in-Games"><a href="#3-Application-of-Team-System-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Application of Team System in Games"></a>3. Application of Team System in Games</h2><p>In practice, we will find that the team system in different games will be divided into two types of construction and classification: single-method teaming and composite-method teaming. This is because designers will build the team system according to the core gameplay of the game - games that focus on casual social gameplay will emphasize the sociality of teaming in the design, and such games can usually only be teamed up through friend invitations; on the other hand, games that focus on cooperative combat will pay more attention to the functionality of the team system in the design, and the priority is how to find the most suitable teammates for players. This team system is often composed of a combination of multiple methods.</p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Single-Method-Team-System"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Single-Method-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Single-Method Team System"></a>Characteristics of Single-Method Team System</h3><p>This teaming method completely relies on the friend system, and players can only form their own game team through friend invitations.</p>
<p>The advantage of this design is that it can better consolidate and promote the existing social relationship between players and friends, but the disadvantage is that it is more difficult to meet and develop new potential friends through team games.</p>
<h4 id="《APEX》"><a href="#《APEX》" class="headerlink" title="《APEX》"></a>《APEX》</h4><p>The teaming function of <em>APEX</em> is nested in the battle matching system and relies on the friend system. It is a very typical single-method team system.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffaed2b85-1789-495c-a3ca-938341e3b669.png/size/" alt="*APEX* Teaming Interface."></p>
<h4 id="《Battlefield-V》"><a href="#《Battlefield-V》" class="headerlink" title="《Battlefield V》"></a>《Battlefield V》</h4><p>Although the teaming function of <em>Battlefield V</em> is independent and permanently resident in the lower right corner of the game interface, it still relies on the friend system. It is also a very typical single-method team system.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fb1cb1cd1-8f6f-4e40-9307-11247128789b.png/size/" alt="*Battlefield V* Teaming Interface."></p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Composite-Method-Team-System"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Composite-Method-Team-System" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Composite-Method Team System"></a>Characteristics of Composite-Method Team System</h3><p>In most game designs, social-based teaming and quick teaming are often combined to provide players with more diverse social choices, thereby improving the overall game experience.</p>
<h4 id="《Overwatch》"><a href="#《Overwatch》" class="headerlink" title="《Overwatch》"></a>《Overwatch》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, recently matched teammates&#x2F;opponents, independent team system</p>
<p>In <em>Overwatch</em>, players can form their own game team through three ways: friend list invitation, recently matched teammates&#x2F;opponents, and independent team system. The entire team system is very complete, with both sociality and convenience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F34fbfb0c-5c7e-4de4-9e07-ebb9ded0eb50.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ff4ff69e9-d960-4e7e-8cb9-2a642a5a857b.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fd50da56e-e49e-4782-b48e-028c9f033dd0.png/size/" alt="*Overwatch* Interface Examples."></p>
<h4 id="《Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened》"><a href="#《Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened》" class="headerlink" title="《Harry Potter: Magic Awakened》"></a>《Harry Potter: Magic Awakened》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, independent team system</p>
<p>The team system of the mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> also adds diversified teaming methods. Players can not only team up with friends, but also find suitable powerful teammates through wizard mutual assistance when encountering difficult levels, which reduces the possibility of players getting stuck and also broadens the social channels of the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F01a496e5-5ced-41f6-b230-627f893c86f7.png/size/" alt="*Harry Potter: Magic Awakened* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Fa0a9c3b3-f33d-459e-9e43-581870a7cac9.png/size/" alt="*Harry Potter: Magic Awakened* Interface Examples."></p>
<h4 id="《Warframe》"><a href="#《Warframe》" class="headerlink" title="《Warframe》"></a>《Warframe》</h4><p>Composite method teaming: social list invitation, open world, public channel</p>
<p><em>Warframe</em> is more biased towards MMO in the construction of the social system - players can not only invite friends from the list to team up, but also invite strangers in the public channel and the open world to team up. In addition, its designer added the “Recently Met People” module to the social interface to record other players who recently played dungeons with the player, which also has a certain positive significance for promoting social interaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F11e23732-5856-453b-b6f7-0534b4678f75.png/size/" alt="*Warframe* Interface Examples."><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2Ffcec48c3-7f17-4847-95ba-3e81a4ed951f.png/size/" alt="*Warframe* Interface Examples."></p>
<h2 id="4-Common-Summary"><a href="#4-Common-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Common Summary"></a>4. Common Summary</h2><p>In the design of the team interface, the main functions are composed of 6 interface elements: team information, team incentives, player invitation, game mode selection, team search, and filtering conditions. Different types of team system designs have different emphasis on presentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211105%2F51be01df-b2bd-476d-ad7f-d170daebda22.png/size/" alt="Example of a breakdown of the elements within a Teaming Interface."></p>
<p>On the other hand, in terms of the packaging form of page design, there are currently two mainstream forms: scene-based design and modular design. Scene-based design can give players a more immersive game experience, while modular design makes players’ operations more efficient. Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. As a designer, it is also necessary to consider the degree of fit between the packaging form and the overall tone of the game in specific projects.</p>

<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>In the world of multiplayer games, the design method of the team system is closely related to the core gameplay. Games that focus on casual social interaction often have a closer connection between their team system and the friend system; while games that focus on cooperative combat have a closer connection between their team system and battle matching.</p>

<h2 id="Foreword"><a href="#Foreword" class="headerlink" title="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Attention is the only portal of our mind, and everything in consciousness must pass through it.”<br>—— Ushinsky, a famous Russian educator and the founder of Russian educational psychology</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human attention is limited, and it is difficult for players to notice all the content of each interface in the game. How can we make the game more attractive and easier to get the attention of players? How can we make players pay more attention to the important content you want them to pay attention to? How can we allow players to avoid distractions during the game and get a better gaming experience? This article will introduce a way to enhance player attention - emphasis techniques.</p>
<h2 id="I-What-are-Emphasis-Techniques"><a href="#I-What-are-Emphasis-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="I. What are Emphasis Techniques?"></a>I. What are Emphasis Techniques?</h2><p>Emphasis techniques are methods to draw attention to a text area or image area. Emphasis techniques are very effective techniques to bring people’s attention to design elements.</p>
<p>Before delving into the problem, let’s first understand the characteristics of human memory and the principles of visual attention.</p>
<h3 id="Memory-Characteristics"><a href="#Memory-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Memory Characteristics"></a>Memory Characteristics</h3><p>Human memory is divided into short-term memory and long-term memory. Short-term memory automatically stores current information and is easy to retrieve, but its capacity is limited, so people can only maintain focused attention for a short time. When we perform a complex operation, if there are many restrictions and not enough clear guidance, it is easy to feel confused and irritable, not knowing how to continue, and the attention is interrupted.</p>
<h3 id="Principles-of-Visual-Attention"><a href="#Principles-of-Visual-Attention" class="headerlink" title="Principles of Visual Attention"></a>Principles of Visual Attention</h3><p>The area of the human eye that perceives visually only occupies a small part of the retina, which makes our visual ability very small and difficult to accommodate a lot of information at the same time. To keep the brain focused on something, there needs to be a clear goal. Once the human eye loses focus, it will lead to people’s attention being distracted and losing interest. Therefore, it becomes very necessary to help the brain organize basic element information when there is a large amount of visual information input. When facing exactly the same information, content, function, and interaction process, the different visual representations of elements will affect the efficiency, attention, and even understanding of information in the visual processing process.</p>
<p>Because of these characteristics, in order to enhance the player’s attention, it is necessary to make the presentation of information clear and definite, grab the player’s eyeballs in visual performance, make them easily capture the key information, and make a deep impression. Highlighting certain design elements through emphasis techniques aims to guide players to quickly obtain effective information, and allow players to pay attention to where you want them to pay attention. At the same time, it can also enhance the depth and layering of the game interface, thereby improving the player’s gaming experience.</p>
<h2 id="II-What-are-the-Emphasis-Techniques"><a href="#II-What-are-the-Emphasis-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="II. What are the Emphasis Techniques?"></a>II. What are the Emphasis Techniques?</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Bold&#x2F;Italic&#x2F;Underline</strong></p>
<p>If the designer wants to make the emphasized element look slightly different, they can consider making it bold, italic, or underlining it to emphasize topics, labels, titles, and small paragraphs of text. Using bold and thin together can well express the sense of hierarchy and convey the importance of the text. Bold is usually more popular because it brings little change, but it can clearly emphasize the target element. Italics also have little impact on the design and are also a very effective emphasis method. Sometimes it is easier to attract attention than bold, but italics are difficult to distinguish, and are very effective for special fonts. Underlining brings about great changes and violates the principle of easy identification, so it should be used as little as possible or not at all.</p>
<p>In the <em>Fall Guys</em> game loading page, the title of the game play introduction is emphasized in bold and underlined. When there are multiple titles on the page, the hierarchy of the titles is distinguished to guide players to read the game rules under the title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2F7ee030be-e787-4c14-99f7-c196245f471c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211108&#x2F;7ee030be-e787-4c14-99f7-c196245f471c.png"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Use Capital Letters</strong></p>
<p>Using capital letters can highlight the text you want players to notice. Uppercase and lowercase convey different feelings, which will affect readability, understandability, and usability. In a complex display area, using uppercase to emphasize labels or keywords will be very effective, which can enhance the sense of hierarchy and prevent small fonts from mixing with the background. Using capital letters is more effective when the font style cannot be adjusted, and the main text and title text can be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>In the settings page of <em>CSGO</em>, capital letters are used for the main title, detailed setting content, and reset button. When the page has more content and more levels, the use of capital letters distinguishes the primary and secondary content and highlights the key content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2F3190427c-fb74-4ecb-9b53-710a9851d432.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211108&#x2F;3190427c-fb74-4ecb-9b53-710a9851d432.png"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Use Different Colors</strong></p>
<p>Using different colors is a very effective emphasis technique. Color can attract attention, integrate elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics. There are three types of cone cells in the human retina, and these three types of cone cells are more sensitive to different wavelengths of color. Therefore, when people see different sensitive color domains at the same time, the eyes will feel a strong contrast. Using different colors can achieve the effect of emphasis. The stronger the color contrast, the more attention it can attract.</p>
<p>Some colors are inherently more eye-catching than other colors. Red, blue, green, orange, and yellow feel from heavy to light. Warm colors can be used for foreground elements, and cool colors can be used for background elements. When matching elements, light gray is a safe color that will not compete with other colors. Light neutral tones can help us bring more visual effects. Of course, colors cannot be used without restriction. According to the number that people can recognize after a glance, the types of colors need to be limited to about five, and they should be used in conjunction with other emphasis techniques.</p>
<p>Saturated colors are more interesting and vibrant, and can attract attention. Unsaturated dull colors will make people feel serious, and unsaturated bright colors usually make people feel friendly. When you need to highlight product performance and efficiency, you can use unsaturated colors. More saturated colors will attract more attention than unsaturated colors. If you want to use different saturated colors in combination, please be careful, because they will visually interfere with each other and increase eye fatigue.</p>
<p>The stronger the brightness contrast, the more attention it can attract. Contrast will naturally attract people’s attention to an element. When an element contrasts with its surroundings, it will also appear visually heavier.</p>
<p>The use of color contrast is common in games.</p>
<p>In the start interface of <em>Onmyoji Arena</em>, the [Match] button is highlighted with a striking red color to distinguish the importance of the content by color, improve recognition efficiency, so that players can focus on the button at a glance, distinguish the primary and secondary levels from other content, attract players’ attention and also guide players’ choices.</p>

<pre><code>In *Naraka: Bladepoint*, colors are used to distinguish the quality of loot piles and equipment. Blue piles have &quot;normal quality&quot; equipment and props, gold piles have a &quot;highest quality&quot; drop probability, green piles must have &quot;soul jades&quot;, gold equipment is ultimate, purple is excellent, blue is good, and gray is ordinary. In combat scenarios with a large amount of information, color marking can help players quickly obtain information, and high-quality equipment is easy to stand out, and players can go to pick it up in a targeted manner.

<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Reverse Type</strong></p>
<p>Reverse type refers to printing text or lines in intaglio to expose the white of the paper. It is a striking and eye-catching method. Using reverse type on a darker color block and not filling the image and text with any color can form a contrast, which can make the image and text appear more clearly. Reverse type is suitable for text, but not so much for images or shapes. It should be noted that although reverse type can attract people’s attention, the design scheme will also change significantly as a result, so it should not be overused.</p>

*Without Reverse Type and With Reverse Type*

---

The interface of *Pokémon Quest* uses reverse type to highlight information, such as the dark background and white text of the level card. Due to the use of reverse type, its overall design style is also adapted to it.

<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Blinking</strong></p>
<p>Blinking refers to letting an element switch back and forth between two different states. This method can effectively attract attention. When most of the elements on the page are static, users are more likely to be attracted by dynamic things. It should be noted that the blinking technique is only suitable for emphasizing those important things that require people to react to them immediately. Since blinking will affect identification and easily distract people, once the notification effect is achieved, the blinking should be turned off immediately.</p>
<p>In the start interface of <em>Fortnite</em>, the design of the task button, if there is a new task, the button will keep blinking to attract players to click. After clicking to view, the blinking achieves the notification effect, and the button will return to its original state.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>The use of emphasis techniques also needs to be moderate. In a design work, the emphasized content should not exceed 10%. The percentage of emphasized elements in a work is inversely proportional to its effect. Emphasis techniques should be used sparingly and applied consistently throughout the design.</p>
<h2 id="III-Conclusion"><a href="#III-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="III. Conclusion"></a>III. Conclusion</h2><p>When players are introduced to a new game, the first impression is very important. To attract players’ attention, it is necessary to have clear information communication and a good visual experience. Emphasis techniques are an effective way to enhance player attention. Appropriately using emphasis techniques to organize information and guide the line of sight can make the game easier for players to get started, avoid wasting time, and reduce player churn caused by insufficient information communication, forming a better visual effect and gaining more attention.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211108/28584_984383.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gameplay of Japanese female-oriented games (Otome Games) has now stabilized. According to Yano Research Institute, the market size of “female-oriented games” in Japan in 2015 was about 16.3 billion yen; it then fell slightly, maintaining at 15.5 billion yen in 2017. At the same time, the population of Japan in 2017 was about 130 million, the game population reached 68 million, of which mobile game players were about 54 million; in 2017, female mobile players in Japan accounted for 37.2%. Based on this, it is estimated that the ARPU value of Japanese female mobile players in the female-oriented game market is about 770 yen. The gameplay of female-oriented games is not limited to dress-up and story-watching, but also includes rhythm games, nurturing games, and other gameplay modes. Although the Japanese female-oriented mobile game market is booming, the fierce competition has also led to many mobile games experiencing a flash in the pan, ending service in less than half a year.</p>
<p>So why can some female-oriented mobile games be successfully operated for more than 5 years, while others end operations hastily? This article analyzes the reasons by compiling the Google Play and iOS store reviews of the long-lived and highly popular Japanese female-oriented games <em>Ensemble Stars!! Basic</em> and <em>Ensemble Stars!! Music</em> (Japanese name: あんさんぶるスターズ), and comparing them with the reviews of low-popularity and short-lived games such as <em>DREAM!ing</em>, <em>I-Chu</em>, and <em>MakeS</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Demands-of-Japanese-Female-Users-in-Mobile-Games"><a href="#Demands-of-Japanese-Female-Users-in-Mobile-Games" class="headerlink" title="Demands of Japanese Female Users in Mobile Games"></a>Demands of Japanese Female Users in Mobile Games</h2><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2Ff401a839-85b9-442e-ac60-abc5e9bfcb75.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211108&#x2F;f401a839-85b9-442e-ac60-abc5e9bfcb75.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1: There are nearly 50 characters in “Ensemble Stars!! Music”</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="First-Character-Building"><a href="#First-Character-Building" class="headerlink" title="First: Character Building"></a>First: Character Building</h3><p>Among character building, the most mentioned by female players is voice actors, followed by character design. The maturity of the Japanese voice actor market gives Japanese female-oriented mobile game characters a variety of voices. Taking <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> as an example, more than 40 characters have their own unique voices. Whether it is the daily story dubbing or the singing at the concert, the voice actors give the paper figures the ability to speak and sing. The second is the character creation. <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> focuses on idol cultivation. There are dozens of characters, but each character has its own unique character setting. The character design is exquisite and beautiful, and the characteristics of different groups are distinct. There is the traditional Japanese musical instrument group “Akatsuki” and the cute and compact style “Ra*bits” group. Although there are many characters, there is no sense of repetition and aesthetic fatigue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2Ff1331e48-6f0a-483d-9a7e-0e2337a487cb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211108&#x2F;f1331e48-6f0a-483d-9a7e-0e2337a487cb.png"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Second-Game-Content"><a href="#Second-Game-Content" class="headerlink" title="Second: Game Content"></a>Second: Game Content</h3><p>The second point that Japanese female players pay attention to is the content in the game, which is mainly divided into plot, gameplay, and events. The plot mainly revolves around the campus and idols, unfolding a youthful dream-chasing story. The characters in the game are full and vivid. Take Tenshouin Eichi in the game as an example: Tenshouin Eichi is a sickly character. He is gentle, smart, observant, and considerate of his companions, but he is also good at manipulating everything behind the scenes. The conflict between hope and despair in the plot creates a Shakespearean-like dramatic character transformation in the emotional growth of the characters, and the performance of diverse characters.</p>

<p><em>Animation 1: “Ensemble Stars!! 2’s Performance Animation”</em></p>

<p>Although it is a music game, <em>Ensemble Stars!! Music</em> has also achieved the greatest burden reduction. After clearing once, you can automatically play songs with one click, and at the same time you can enjoy the stage performance brought by the characters. From <em>Basic</em> to <em>Music</em>, the upgrade and update of the gameplay and the newly added characters have successfully captured the attention of old and new players. Not sticking to the existing gameplay and trying to innovate has created the history of Ensemble Stars!! dominating the female-oriented game charts.</p>
<p>Time-limited events that unfold with the timeline are also the focus of players’ attention. <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> arranges limited-time events reasonably according to time. Valentine’s Day, White Day, June Bride, fireworks festivals, etc. are all popular events. During the event, players can draw characters who unlock limited costumes through the gacha pool and read event-limited stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2F782df934-a074-4ab3-a97a-61e681c87a06.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211108&#x2F;782df934-a074-4ab3-a97a-61e681c87a06.png"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Third-Game-Operation"><a href="#Third-Game-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Third: Game Operation"></a>Third: Game Operation</h3><p>Japanese female mobile game players will pour their emotions into their favorite virtual characters and become fans of a certain character. Therefore, a reasonable update speed operation will better grasp this group of fans with high game stickiness. In addition to limited-time events in the game, there are also welfare distributions, Twitter support, offline meetups, peripheral sales, cafe collaborations, and other activities. The large group of players and good retention, the prosperous development of game culture, are also conducive to the creation of game IP and the extension of game life.</p>
<h2 id="Comparison-of-Keywords-between-Popular-High-Popularity-Mobile-Games-and-Low-Popularity-Mobile-Games"><a href="#Comparison-of-Keywords-between-Popular-High-Popularity-Mobile-Games-and-Low-Popularity-Mobile-Games" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of Keywords between Popular High-Popularity Mobile Games and Low-Popularity Mobile Games"></a>Comparison of Keywords between Popular High-Popularity Mobile Games and Low-Popularity Mobile Games</h2><p>Among the popular mobile games, the top three words mentioned most by players are: characters, story plot, and no microtransactions; the most mentioned dissatisfaction points by players in low-popularity mobile games are: poor optimization, operational problems, and forced microtransactions. For <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em>, the keywords for its praise are mainly: good publicity, wide audience, good reputation, unique and personalized plot and characters, simple gameplay, and you can play happily without microtransactions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Japanese female-oriented mobile game market, in order to achieve long-term game operation, at least the following points must be met:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The game itself has a stable environment and good optimization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Game content and update speed that will not make users feel bored</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can enjoy the game without paying, and both paying players and non-paying players can get their own game pursuit goals in the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While doing the above three points, <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em> also maintained good publicity channels. In addition to the official stable publicity, old users also brought new players to the game, so the game has a long life.</p>

    <title>Scrum and Game Products</title>
    <url>/2021/11/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20211108_28584_984403/</url>

<p>Scrum, a concept applied in more and more fields, has now become a commonly used work management framework in various companies in the technology field, and game companies are no exception. Different from traditional project management, agile management uses an iterative approach to actively embrace changes and respond quickly to needs. How to build a more efficient team, how to speed up the product development process, and how to manage work schedules in an orderly manner are constantly being explored by every game product team.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Scrum"><a href="#1-What-is-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Scrum?"></a>1. What is Scrum?</h2><p>“Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.”</p>
<p>Scrum is a simple and easy-to-use framework for developing, delivering, and continuously supporting complex products. It is an incremental and iterative development process that helps teams and organizations break down complex problems to better produce work results.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint"><a href="#Sprint" class="headerlink" title="Sprint"></a>Sprint</h3><p>The entire development process consists of several short iteration cycles, and one iteration cycle is called a Sprint.</p>
<p>The length of a Sprint is generally controlled within one month, and the cycle needs to be fixed after it is determined. If the Sprint time is too long, the definition of what to build may change, the complexity may also increase, and the risk may increase. On the other hand, a fixed iteration cycle can help the team better review the work, discover problems, and make timely adjustments. Sprint achieves predictability by ensuring that progress towards goals is inspected and adapted at least once a month, while also limiting risk to one month’s cost. The entire Scrum team must create valuable and practical iterations in each Sprint. For games, the choice of Sprint cycle is a balance between development efficiency and response speed.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Backlog"><a href="#Product-Backlog" class="headerlink" title="Product Backlog"></a>Product Backlog</h3><p>The product backlog records the needs that the team needs to complete. Each Sprint needs to select the highest priority requirements for development. The selected requirements are discussed, analyzed, and estimated at the Sprint Planning Meeting to obtain a corresponding task list, called the Sprint backlog. These requirements must be delivered at the end of the Sprint. Usually, the Product Owner has the final say on the priority of the selected tasks.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Planning-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Planning-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Planning Meeting"></a>Sprint Planning Meeting</h3><p>A meeting to discuss and analyze requirements, and to select the highest priority requirements as the work content of the current Sprint.</p>
<h3 id="Daily-Scrum-Meeting"><a href="#Daily-Scrum-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Daily Scrum Meeting"></a>Daily Scrum Meeting</h3><p>A 15-minute daily meeting participated in by Developers in the team, usually held at the same time and place every day. If the PO and SM need to actively participate in the tasks of this Sprint, they also need to participate in the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to advance progress, arrange the work for the next day&#x2F;current day, and respond positively to existing problems.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Review-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Review-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Review Meeting"></a>Sprint Review Meeting</h3><p>An informal meeting for each Sprint, where the team will present the product or work output, and evaluate and propose ideas for the presentation results. This meeting is centered around the product.</p>
<h3 id="Sprint-Retrospective-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Retrospective-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Retrospective Meeting"></a>Sprint Retrospective Meeting</h3><p>A review meeting at the end of each Sprint. Different from the Review, the meeting will discuss the personnel and team’s work in the current Sprint, discuss the problems existing in the current work status, and propose improvement suggestions and measures. This meeting is an important part of the Scrum framework and helps to build, deliver, and manage complex projects more effectively.</p>
<p>The simple Scrum process is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2Feeae3d97-fe6e-4d0f-9309-0078231c65c5.png/size/" alt="Scrum Process Diagram"></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Scrum-Team"><a href="#2-The-Scrum-Team" class="headerlink" title="2. The Scrum Team"></a>2. The Scrum Team</h2><p>The Scrum team needs to have three necessary roles: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner (PO), and multiple Developers. Note that in this team, there are no branch teams or hierarchical relationships. The entire team focuses on the same goal, which is the Product Goal. Usually, a Scrum team needs to be controlled to a scale of no more than 10 people - small enough to maintain agility, and large enough to complete all important work in each Sprint.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Owner"><a href="#Product-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Product Owner"></a>Product Owner</h3><p>Generally served by a producer, lead planner, or dedicated assistant, responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team from the work of the Scrum team, and also responsible for effective Backlog management, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish and effectively communicate the Product Goal with the team;</li>
<li>Create and clearly express each task in the Product Backlog;</li>
<li>Reasonably prioritize the tasks in the Product Backlog;</li>
<li>Ensure that the Product Backlog is open, transparent, clear, and can be fully understood by team members;</li>
<li>Confirm the development of new features and the repair of BUGs.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Developers"><a href="#Developers" class="headerlink" title="Developers"></a>Developers</h3><p>A team composed of various personnel with different skills, spanning multiple positions, dedicated to completing various tasks in each Sprint. Taking games as an example, team members include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning, operations, programming, art, sound effects, testing, etc.;</li>
<li>The development team is formed and authorized by the organization, and the team needs to be responsible for and manage their own work.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Scrum-Master"><a href="#Scrum-Master" class="headerlink" title="Scrum Master"></a>Scrum Master</h3><p>Serves both the PO and the Developers, aiming to help the team provide solutions to problems during Scrum, remove obstacles, and let the team move in the right direction, acting as a coordinator, order maintainer, and manager. Therefore, it is generally served by a person in the team who is more prestigious and has deep experience. But different from the traditional PM, Developers are responsible for managing their own work, not supervised by the SM.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2Fe2c7681a-ec2c-4e34-8f75-5ad4d9dd18bf.png/size/" alt="Scrum Team Roles"></p>
<h2 id="3-An-Extension-of-a-Scrum-Team-SoS"><a href="#3-An-Extension-of-a-Scrum-Team-SoS" class="headerlink" title="3. An Extension of a Scrum Team - SoS"></a>3. An Extension of a Scrum Team - SoS</h2><p>As the game product progresses step by step, the members of the project team will continue to increase, and the team size will continue to increase. At this time, a Scrum team is obviously not enough to meet the needs. At this time, it is necessary to split the team and adopt the Scrum of Scrums framework.</p>
<p>SoS means that the Scrum Master of each team forms a small group to share the status of each team and respond to potential problems between teams in a timely manner. The SoS team lets all relevant personnel understand what is happening in other teams in the system, determines under what conditions teams need to help each other, determines under what conditions teams need to coordinate, and ensures that all personnel have the same understanding of a common product goal.</p>
<p>The SoS architecture diagram is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211108%2F399e3211-8d19-4d8b-90cb-ee5d96cf1003.png/size/" alt="Scrum of Scrums Diagram"></p>
<h2 id="4-Game-Products-and-Scrum"><a href="#4-Game-Products-and-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="4. Game Products and Scrum"></a>4. Game Products and Scrum</h2><p>In the Internet era, change is the foundation of game survival. A game with a slow update frequency is likely to lose a large number of players in a short period of time. Chasing the ever-changing tastes of players, leading the new trend of the game circle, and creating higher gold-absorbing efficiency are all based on constant changes.</p>
<p>However, without planning and planning, too frequent changes are extremely unfriendly to software development - changes will lead to a lot of repetitive work, affect the development progress, or will have an impact on all completed work, bringing many unexpected jobs. The worst consequence is the internal contradictions caused by disputes over change issues, which affect the overall development progress of the product.</p>
<p>If classified according to whether the change requirements will have an impact on the current development work, it can be roughly divided into two categories: those that have a direct impact and those that do not have a direct impact. The former refers to the work that is being developed, tested, or processed by relevant developers, or that has entered the current iteration cycle to be processed. The latter is that the content related to this requirement is still in the planning stage and has not yet been sent to the developers. At this time, the change does not have a big impact on the current work. Most of the developers oppose the former. Therefore, the Scrum management model is very effective in this situation - with Sprint as a cycle, all work that is already in the current Sprint, whether it is being processed or to be completed, is not allowed to be changed. If it must be changed, then the current work can only be interrupted, the requirement can be removed from the development list, and after modification, it can be put into the next Sprint. If a modification requirement is put forward after the development is completed, it will be regarded as a new requirement, and it will also be scheduled in a future Sprint.</p>
<p>With the continuous increase in development costs, improving efficiency will become the key for game companies. Most companies can no longer afford the business models that will not be used in the end in game development, and they cannot wait until the end of the project to see if something is valuable. It is too late at that time, and the sunk cost will be very large. The main function of Scrum is to remove the bottleneck of wasting workload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because Scrum emphasizes communication and collaboration between teams and rapid response, incorporating QA into the team is a win-win situation for developers and players, and the burden of QA will be reduced compared with the past, avoiding the situation of accumulation. In this way, every bug will be fixed in time, thereby increasing the speed of content development.</p>
<p>Of course, when a company or a team decides to adopt Scrum’s agile management method, it must also face some new challenges.</p>
<p>The top-down hierarchical management culture is transformed into a team-based iterative culture - the change of management model is difficult at the beginning. For the team that uses Scrum to develop products for the first time, how to play their roles well is a challenge, and it is also a major change to get used to reflecting and adjusting according to the short cycle of a Sprint.</p>
<p>From assigning and supervising work to self-management - Scrum encourages teams to self-manage. Under this soft management model, the spontaneity and self-discipline of each team member are particularly important, and there needs to be a common goal and a consistent understanding of it. This also requires the cooperation of PO and SM, especially SM, who needs to take the lead.</p>
<p>In summary, Scrum is only a framework in the final analysis. Different teams, different Scrum Masters, and different Product Owners should set goals and manage work according to their own and product actual conditions, and find the most suitable and balanced agile management model.</p>

    <title>Introduction to Data Desensitization Technology</title>
    <url>/2021/11/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20211115_28584_985589/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211115/28584_985589.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the advent of the big data era, data has become an important factor of production. For data controllers and data processors, how to maximize the value of data flow is the original intention and significance of data mining. However, the exposure of a series of information leakage incidents has made data security more and more widely concerned.</p>
<p>Data security plays an important role in the construction of a data warehouse. The leakage of private or sensitive data will cause serious damage to the property, reputation, personal safety, and legitimate interests of the data subject. Therefore, we need to strictly control access to the data in the warehouse. This requires classifying the sensitivity of the data itself into security levels. With the classification of data security levels, we can better manage data access control to protect data security.</p>
<p>But in the actual production process, the application scenarios will be more complex, and relying on access control alone, will be insufficient and other methods will be needed. Data desensitization is an effective method that can not only meet the needs of daily production, but also protect data security.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Data-Desensitization"><a href="#1-What-is-Data-Desensitization" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Data Desensitization?"></a>1. What is Data Desensitization?</h2><p>Data desensitization refers to the transformation of certain sensitive information through desensitization rules to achieve reliable protection of sensitive and private data. In this way, the security level of the data itself can be downgraded, and the desensitized real data set can be safely used in development, testing, and other non-production environments, as well as in outsourcing or cloud computing environments.</p>
<p>But it should be noted that with the help of data desensitization technology, while erasing sensitive content in the data, it is also necessary to maintain the original data characteristics, business rules, and data correlation, to ensure that we will not be affected by desensitization in development, testing, and data analysis businesses, and to ensure the consistency and validity of data before and after desensitization.</p>
<h2 id="2-Data-Desensitization-Strategies"><a href="#2-Data-Desensitization-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="2. Data Desensitization Strategies"></a>2. Data Desensitization Strategies</h2><p>Strategically, data desensitization is divided into Static Data Masking (SDM) and Dynamic Data Masking (DDM).</p>
<h3 id="Static-Data-Desensitization"><a href="#Static-Data-Desensitization" class="headerlink" title="Static Data Desensitization"></a>Static Data Desensitization</h3><p>Static data desensitization is the “moving and simulated replacement” of data. The data is extracted for desensitization processing, and then distributed to downstream links for free access and read-write. The desensitized data is isolated from the production environment, meeting business needs and ensuring the security of the production database.</p>
<p>Static data desensitization is suitable for extracting data from the production environment, desensitizing it, and distributing it to scenarios such as testing, development, training, and data analysis. Sometimes we may need to copy the data from the production environment to the test and development libraries to troubleshoot problems or perform data analysis, but for security reasons, sensitive data cannot be stored in a non-production environment. In this case, sensitive data must be desensitized from the production environment before being used in a non-production environment. In this way, the desensitized data is isolated from the production environment, meeting business needs while ensuring the security of production data.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure above, the user’s real name, mobile phone number, ID number, and bank card number are desensitized by replacement, invalidation, scrambling, and symmetric encryption.</p>
<h3 id="Dynamic-Data-Desensitization"><a href="#Dynamic-Data-Desensitization" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Data Desensitization"></a>Dynamic Data Desensitization</h3><p>Dynamic data desensitization performs desensitization processing in real time while accessing sensitive data. It can execute different desensitization schemes for different roles, different permissions, and different data types, thereby ensuring that the returned data is usable and secure.</p>
<p>Dynamic data desensitization is generally used in the production environment, because sometimes in different situations, different levels of desensitization processing are required for reading the same sensitive data. For example, different desensitization schemes may be executed for different roles and different permissions.</p>
<h3 id="Differences-in-Technical-Routes-of-Static-Desensitization-and-Dynamic-Desensitization"><a href="#Differences-in-Technical-Routes-of-Static-Desensitization-and-Dynamic-Desensitization" class="headerlink" title="Differences in Technical Routes of Static Desensitization and Dynamic Desensitization"></a>Differences in Technical Routes of Static Desensitization and Dynamic Desensitization</h3><p>Static desensitization directly uses various desensitization algorithms such as masking, deformation, replacement, randomization, format-preserving encryption (FPE), and strong encryption algorithms (such as AES) to perform data masking disruption for different data types, and the desensitized data can be loaded into different environments according to user needs. Static desensitization can provide different loading methods such as file-to-file, file-to-database, database-to-database, and database-to-file. The exported data is stored in an external storage medium in a desensitized form, which actually changes the stored data content.</p>
<p>Dynamic desensitization accurately parses SQL statements to match desensitization conditions, such as: access IP, MAC, database user, client tool, operating system user, host name, time, number of affected rows, etc. After successful matching, it rewrites the query SQL or intercepts and protects the returned desensitized data to the application side, thereby achieving desensitization of sensitive data. In fact, the data stored in the production database has not changed.</p>
<h2 id="3-Data-Desensitization-Solutions"><a href="#3-Data-Desensitization-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="3. Data Desensitization Solutions"></a>3. Data Desensitization Solutions</h2><p>The data desensitization system can define and write desensitization rules according to different business scenarios, and can perform data desensitization without landing for a certain sensitive field of a library table.</p>
<p>There are many ways to desensitize data, but no matter which method is used, it must be based on different application scenarios and follow the following two principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>remain meaningful for application logic</li>
<li>sufficiently treated to avoid reverse engineer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Invalidation"><a href="#Invalidation" class="headerlink" title="Invalidation"></a>Invalidation</h3><p>The invalidation scheme processes the data to be desensitized by truncating, encrypting, hiding, etc. the data value of the field to desensitize the sensitive data and make it no longer valuable. Generally, special characters (*, etc.) are used to replace the true value. This method of hiding sensitive data is simple, but the disadvantage is that the user cannot know the format of the original data. If the user wants to obtain complete information, the user must be authorized to query. For example, if we replace the ID number with * to replace the real number, it becomes “220724 ****** 3523”, which is very simple.</p>
<h3 id="Random-Value"><a href="#Random-Value" class="headerlink" title="Random Value"></a>Random Value</h3><p>Random value replacement replaces letters with random letters, numbers with random numbers, and text with random text to change sensitive data. The advantage of this scheme is that it can retain the format of the original data to a certain extent, and this method is often imperceptible to users.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Replacement"><a href="#Data-Replacement" class="headerlink" title="Data Replacement"></a>Data Replacement</h3><p>Data replacement is similar to the previous invalidation method, except that special characters are not used for masking, but a set virtual value is used to replace the true value. For example, we set the mobile phone number to “13651300000”.</p>
<h3 id="Symmetric-Encryption"><a href="#Symmetric-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Symmetric Encryption"></a>Symmetric Encryption</h3><p>Symmetric encryption is a special reversible desensitization method. Sensitive data is encrypted through an encryption key and algorithm. The ciphertext format is consistent with the original data in logical rules, and the original data can be restored by decrypting the key. It is important to note the security of the key.</p>
<h3 id="Average"><a href="#Average" class="headerlink" title="Average"></a>Average</h3><p>The average scheme is often used in statistical scenarios. For numerical data, we first calculate their average value, and then make the desensitized value randomly distributed around the average value, thereby keeping the sum of the data unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="Offset-and-Rounding"><a href="#Offset-and-Rounding" class="headerlink" title="Offset and Rounding"></a>Offset and Rounding</h3><p>This method changes numerical data by random shifting. Offset and rounding ensure the approximate authenticity of the range while maintaining data security. It is closer to real data than the previous schemes and is of great significance in big data analysis scenarios. For example, the date field 2020-12-08 15:12:25 becomes 2018-01-02 15:00:00.</p>
<p>Data desensitization rules are often used in combination with multiple schemes in practical applications to achieve a higher level of security.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is static desensitization or dynamic desensitization, the ultimate goal is to prevent the abuse of private data within the organization and prevent private data from flowing out of the organization without desensitization. In the design and implementation of data desensitization schemes, it is more important to start from specific application scenarios for overall design, taking into account the important consideration dimension of data warehouse construction. The implementation of data desensitization can provide strong support for the promotion of organizational data security.</p>

    <title>The Core Experience of Action Role-Playing Games</title>
    <url>/2021/11/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20211115_28584_985596/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211115/28584_985596.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>APRG games, or Action Role-Playing Games, differ from typical RPGs in that they incorporate action elements, replacing the turn-based combat of RPGs with a more refined combat system. This enhances the gameplay in combat, attracting players who enjoy action games.</p>
<p>When discussing action games, it’s impossible to ignore the era of arcade dominance, when arcade halls were ubiquitous. It was during this time that most players were introduced to various action fighting games, such as <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</em>, and <em>Knights of Valour</em>. These classics became cherished childhood memories for many. Players, using joysticks and a few buttons, controlled characters to execute fantastic moves, captivating countless individuals. So, what experiences can players expect from ARPGs, which blend action and RPG elements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2Fbe9dc595-7c1e-42d6-a6ee-d8eb23fde3a0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;be9dc595-7c1e-42d6-a6ee-d8eb23fde3a0.png"></p>

<h2 id="1-Action-and-Strike-Feedback"><a href="#1-Action-and-Strike-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="1. Action and Strike Feedback"></a>1. Action and Strike Feedback</h2><p>In games featuring action elements, “strike feedback” (打击感 - dǎ jī gǎn) is a topic frequently discussed by players. Strike feedback originates from the game’s visual and auditory feedback to the player. Visual feedback includes animation, hit effects, hitstun, camera zoom and shake, as well as appropriate special effects and visible air disturbances. Auditory feedback requires appropriate sound effects, meaning sounds that match the materials colliding, with accurate sound source location and timing. For example, the sound of a sword hitting a rock should not be the sound of it hitting water. Failing to provide accurate auditory feedback significantly diminishes the player’s experience. The fluidity and coordination of moves in the game also affect the overall strike feedback. For instance, when a character moves, the limbs should bend in coordination with the steps. If the action designer has some martial arts foundation, they can better grasp the details of limb movements, providing players with more realistic visual feedback.</p>
<h2 id="2-PVE-Character-Progression-养成感-yang-cheng-gan"><a href="#2-PVE-Character-Progression-养成感-yang-cheng-gan" class="headerlink" title="2. PVE: Character Progression (养成感 - yǎng chéng gǎn)"></a>2. PVE: Character Progression (养成感 - yǎng chéng gǎn)</h2><p>With the development of the gaming industry and advancements in game styles, pure action games have a shrinking player base. Action is increasingly becoming just one element within a game. Action games have a certain skill barrier; not all players can achieve feats like no-hit runs, as some skilled action game players do. Most players have average skill levels, and improving technically is a painful process with often weak feedback. Players need to learn from constant failures, which can accumulate negative emotions. This is why many players who bought <em>Dark Souls 3</em> gave up before even defeating the first boss.</p>
<p>In early ACT games, there was no stat-based advantage, only a skill-based one. A player’s skill determined how far they could progress. However, ARPGs introduce stat progression. Characters can improve themselves by leveling up, acquiring better equipment and skills, or gaining various abilities. Defeating opponents might not strictly require these systems, but they make battles easier and faster, providing players with a sense of progression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2F5fb1a195-dae3-40a8-abf6-9ffcbfc5ed64.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;5fb1a195-dae3-40a8-abf6-9ffcbfc5ed64.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In 《NieR:Automata》, you can collect chips to enhance the protagonist.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The progression process is further amplified in online ARPGs. It leverages the player’s desire for constant improvement, encouraging them to invest time and effort in the game. By allowing players to win battles, or win more easily, a sense of becoming stronger is created, leading to satisfaction in the progression process.  However, this progression needs to be balanced. If a player’s stats completely overwhelm the game’s enemies, making skill irrelevant, it will quickly diminish the game’s playability. Once players become unstoppable “lawnmowers,” the fun of the game will quickly disappear.</p>
<h2 id="3-PVP-Game-Theory-博弈-bo-yi"><a href="#3-PVP-Game-Theory-博弈-bo-yi" class="headerlink" title="3. PVP: Game Theory (博弈 - bó yì)"></a>3. PVP: Game Theory (博弈 - bó yì)</h2><p>Many ARPG online games include both PVE and PVP content, with PVP attracting a significant audience.  While PVE emphasizes experiencing character progression and achieving victory, PVP emphasizes fair competition, where players triumph through strategic gameplay (博弈). The key difference is that players are facing real people, not AI. When discussing action PVP, many players might first think of combos. Indeed, stylish combos are a major source of enjoyment in PVP, but the core of PVP is actually game theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211115%2F5eb041ed-1f58-45c6-99f3-e8a7dbe7ae37.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211115&#x2F;5eb041ed-1f58-45c6-99f3-e8a7dbe7ae37.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In 《Street Fighter V》 high-level matches, there are full of probing and Game Theory.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If a player practices an unbeatable combo that can instantly defeat an opponent upon a successful hit, but lacks strategic ability, they won’t be able to land the combo in actual combat. They’ll be crushed by players who might not even have mastered combos but are skilled in actual combat.  Unlike traditional fighting games, ARPGs generally simplify skills into single button presses. Players don’t need to “input” complex commands to use skills; pressing a specific button executes the corresponding skill.  This further reduces the difficulty of performing combos and amplifies the role of game theory in combat.</p>
<p>Game theory in PVP encompasses all actions taken by both sides to gain a more advantageous position.  How to hit the enemy without being hit is the eternal challenge. Within the allotted time, the strategic interactions between players determine the victor. This includes controlling distance, predicting the opponent’s moves, baiting them into attacking, and so on – essentially, predicting the opponent’s predictions. In some online PVP battlegrounds, to ensure fairness, the game will implement balancing measures, reducing the influence of factors like player level, equipment, and other progression elements. However, these factors still play a role, giving high-spending players some room to exert their advantage.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Action elements provide players with the exhilarating thrill of combat. The progression system offers continuous feedback and a sense of satisfaction. PVP allows players to enjoy the strategic element of battling others. By mastering the key aspects of these elements, developers can capture the hearts of most ARPG players.</p>

    <title>Is What&#39;s Last the Least Important? A Brief Discussion on Serial Position Effect</title>
    <url>/2019/01/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20211115_28584_985625/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Is the last thing the least important? The answer is NO.</p>
<p>When writing an article, the opening and closing paragraphs are often crucial. When holding an evening party, the most important programs are often arranged at the opening and the finale. The serial position effect describes such a memory phenomenon: when listing items, the elements at the very beginning and the very end are easier to remember than those in the middle.</p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 was showcased in the finale of the 2020 NetEase Games 520 Conference</em></p>
<p><em>The finale of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony was a chorus of “Hey Jude”</em></p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Serial-Position-Effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Serial-Position-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Serial Position Effect?"></a>What is the Serial Position Effect?</h2><p>The serial position effect includes the primacy effect and the recency effect: the enhanced recall effect produced for items at the beginning position is called the primacy effect. The primacy effect occurs because the initial items on the list can be stored in long-term memory more effectively than later items; the enhanced recall effect produced for items at the end, the most recent, is called the recency effect, which is because the recent items are still in working memory and can be obtained more easily.</p>
<p><em>Human memory is divided into sensory (instantaneous memory), short-term memory, and long-term memory</em></p>
<p>The effect of the serial position effect is closely related to the speed at which items appear. When items appear quickly, the primacy effect is often less significant than the recency effect. This is because people do not have enough time to store the initial items in their memory for a long time, while the recent items are still in working memory and can be easily obtained. However, due to the timeliness of working memory, the recency effect is extremely susceptible to time and other information interference, losing its effectiveness. Therefore, when items appear slowly, the effect of the primacy effect is often more stable and free from interference. However, if the items do not appear one by one at one time, but have a longer interval between one of them, the recency effect often plays a greater role.</p>
<p>In addition, the primacy effect often makes it easier for people to form preconceived stereotypes: in five typical experiments, the adjectives ranked first had a greater impact on the overall impression. For example, the two sentences below: students who saw the first sentence had a more favorable impression of John than students who saw the second sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>John is intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn and jealous;</li>
<li>John is jealous, stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious, and intelligent;</li>
</ul>
<p>This stereotype will affect the subsequent information processing: this also reveals why an excellent opening CG and interaction, as the first impression, can play a foundational role in the player’s evaluation tone.</p>
<h2 id="Application-of-Serial-Position-Effect-in-Game-Interaction"><a href="#Application-of-Serial-Position-Effect-in-Game-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Application of Serial Position Effect in Game Interaction"></a>Application of Serial Position Effect in Game Interaction</h2><p>In the specific game interaction interface, the primacy and recency can be found according to the attention priority of the interface. Based on the cognitive law of the serial position effect, the game behavior of players can be subtly guided.</p>
<p>Take activity tasks as an example. Often, the first pop-up information that players come into contact with when they open the game is the current game task&#x2F;activity interface, guiding players to play the game according to the gameplay designed by the planner.</p>
<p>The task guidance during the game process utilizes the recency effect to provide players with real-time game guidance. When players don’t know what to do, it provides a quick way of thinking about the game.</p>
<p>The same applies to the content arrangement of the event page and the mall page. Often, limited-time events&#x2F;main promotion packages&#x2F;preferential packages are often placed at the beginning and end according to the attention priority. Such operations often make players choose the more time-sensitive&#x2F;more popular&#x2F;relatively more favorable package first.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the serial position effect also has a certain impact on attribution. In combat games, the performance in the late stage is often considered by players to have a more decisive effect on the final result. At the same time, because of the recency effect, the effect of the end of the game is easier to remember than the effect of the middle part of the game, which will have an important impact on the player’s experience and evaluation. Therefore, the user experience in the final part is also crucial.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The serial position effect is very common in people’s daily life and cognitive behavior, and plays a subtle role in people’s decision-making, attribution, and evaluation. Relevant scholars also pointed out that when acquaintances interact, the recency effect plays a greater role; when interacting with strangers, the primacy effect plays a greater role. Reasonably using the cognitive law of the serial position effect according to the situation will help designers create a smoother user experience and obtain higher user evaluations.</p>

    <title>Considerations for Game Map Design</title>
    <url>/2021/11/17/netease-ux-articles/news_20211119_28584_986688/</url>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In some very early games, such as the three classic Western RPGs: <em>Wizardry</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, and <em>Might and Magic</em>, there were no maps. So for older generations of gamers, playing games might have required them to draw maps themselves with pen and paper. Without the guidance of a map, it was easy for players to get “lost” in the game. Players couldn’t remember the routes at all, which made the game more challenging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F5a2fa1c8-6482-4335-a90c-b33acd5b5ff2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;5a2fa1c8-6482-4335-a90c-b33acd5b5ff2.png"></p>

<p><em>《Might and Magic》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>With the continuous development of hardware and software technology, all aspects of video games have been improved, and more and more game designers have begun to pay more attention to improving the gaming experience. For some games that require “maps”, the design of game maps has gradually become refined and distinctive. A good game map can bring players a lot of surprising experiences and also bring more diverse gameplay. For most video games, the player’s understanding of the overall world view of a game largely comes from their perception of the game space. Therefore, for games that require maps, it is crucial to enable players to read the map.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-a-Game-Map"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Game-Map" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Game Map?"></a>1. What is a Game Map?</h2><p>A game map virtualizes a complete world. The existence of a map can, to a certain extent, present the world view of the entire game to players in a more intuitive form. All events, characters, and environments are developed on the basis of the map. Different sizes of game maps will be designed according to the world view and gameplay of different games. Maps are generally presented to players in the following forms:</p>
<h3 id="A-Complete-3D-Modeled-Scene"><a href="#A-Complete-3D-Modeled-Scene" class="headerlink" title="A Complete 3D Modeled Scene"></a>A Complete 3D Modeled Scene</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F5bfff572-dc8d-4e7e-8eec-cc21530851ef.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;5bfff572-dc8d-4e7e-8eec-cc21530851ef.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Transport Fever 2》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In this type of map, the game side provides a limited 3D scene, and players need to explore in this 3D model world. Typical examples include planning simulation games such as <em>Cities: Skylines</em> and <em>Transport Fever 2</em>. The size of the map is the size of the world that players can customize. Players can customize a virtual world and还原(huányuán - restore) the real-world scene in equal proportions.</p>
<h3 id="A-UI-Interface-Displaying-the-World-View"><a href="#A-UI-Interface-Displaying-the-World-View" class="headerlink" title="A UI Interface Displaying the World View"></a>A UI Interface Displaying the World View</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F3b1ea503-a3f3-458a-929b-481aea2135f4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;3b1ea503-a3f3-458a-929b-481aea2135f4.png"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>《Conqueror’s Blade》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This type of map is generally presented in a relatively flat form, with various signs indicating different attributes appearing on the map, which may represent various locations, events, tasks, etc. In this type of map, players can understand their position and see the locations of different tasks as if they were standing in a god-like perspective, allowing players to clearly understand the direction of the destination they want to reach.</p>

Maps and Functions of Different Types of Games"></a>2. Maps and Functions of Different Types of Games</h2><p>However, not all games need to have maps. Board games generally do not have maps, such as match-3 games like <em>Candy Crush</em>, and games like <em>Arknights</em> and <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>. The so-called “map” is actually a UI interface showing the game progress, generally a linear route, to tell the player which level they have reached. The “map” of this type of game does not essentially undertake the functions of “guiding” and “showing the world view” that a map should have. Apart from some elements related to the game itself that appear in the interface, it is essentially a level list display.</p>

<p>In some side-scrolling games, their maps include the functions of “guiding” and “building the world view”. This type of map can also be directly jumped to, achieving the so-called “guiding” function, and to a certain extent, it also reflects the world view of the game, but it is closer to the above-mentioned “pseudo-map” and does not have a strong directional indication. It is more like a more complete UI interface.</p>

<p>The maps of MOBA games mainly serve the functions of “guiding and marking positions”. In MOBA games that focus on competitive fun, the characteristics of the game determine that players will not spend much energy on exploring the map. Typical examples are <em>Dota</em> and <em>LOL</em>. Their map design ideas are relatively similar. Generally, the size of the map is relatively small, and the classic diagonal line form is adopted. Players start from the bases on two diagonal lines to PK. Games like <em>Demigod</em> and <em>Bloodline Champions</em> are based on three lanes and cross each other twice. The maps of MOBA games are limited by routes, so there is less room for development.</p>

<p>Open-world games have a high dependence on maps. The design of the game itself and the design of the map complement each other. The design of the map is to allow players to have a more immersive experience. The fun of the game is often presented in the process of players running around the map. Like <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the characters controlled by players can run and fly in the virtual world. Completing a task may require passing through many places. In this process, many hidden suspense in the map may be unlocked. Maps that are too small often cannot carry such a large world view, nor can they show the characteristics of the game itself. In FPS games, the map also has the function of “guiding”, which allows players to know the location of teammates and enemies. These games generally have large and small maps.</p>

<p>Of course, there are also some games that cannot be completely classified, such as <em>Dark Souls</em>. Its map design is between the traditional open world and linear levels. It combines linear levels in an open, non-linear way. This cleverly utilizes the strengths of both, retaining the freedom in the open world and giving players a lot of space to explore, while retaining the storyline and quest line set by the game designer, better avoiding the misunderstanding of players being at a loss in the open world, making the overall design of the game still compact and ingenious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F0380d298-e463-4d13-81e7-f5d1fba1a3e2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;0380d298-e463-4d13-81e7-f5d1fba1a3e2.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-The-Significance-of-the-Existence-of-Small-Maps"><a href="#3-The-Significance-of-the-Existence-of-Small-Maps" class="headerlink" title="3. The Significance of the Existence of Small Maps"></a>3. The Significance of the Existence of Small Maps</h2><p>The above statements are basically large maps that can present the overall world view in various games. In many games, there are also auxiliary small maps. The main function of the small map is to provide immediate directions and feedback information. Often the position of the small map will exist in a certain corner of the screen, which is convenient for players to check immediately, but it should avoid interfering with the player’s vision as much as possible. Compared with the large map, the small map can help players quickly understand their position in the overall situation and the surrounding geographical environment during the game. In some game settings, you can also see information about resources and enemies. Especially for some games with larger sizes, more complexity, and greater difficulty, the absence of a small map will increase the difficulty of the game, and it is very unfriendly to some players who are “directionally challenged”, and they may not be able to advance the progress of the game for a long time.</p>
<p>Like some MOBA-type competitive games, since in many cases it is a team battle, there will generally be a small map in the game interface to provide a global view and better strengthen some communication with teammates. The setting of the small map reduces the difficulty for players to play the game. Players can quickly obtain some information without having to study the map in detail, remember the route, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, not all games require small maps. The gameplay attributes and needs of the game itself still need to be considered. Typical examples are many games by Hidetaka Miyazaki, such as <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>. In order to cooperate with the needs of their own game themes and create a more immersive game experience, if a small map appears in the interface, it may destroy some of the game atmosphere. Without the guidance of a small map, players need to explore the route themselves and remember it, so this requires players to form their own imagination of the overall space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F17b9a3a5-6467-49ae-b52f-18449260a1c1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;17b9a3a5-6467-49ae-b52f-18449260a1c1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There are also some games that will weaken the small map in the game. For example, <em>Identity V</em> only has a small map in the upper left corner of the screen that basically only indicates the direction of the character. It will not have a strong presence in the overall interface. The blurred information prompts also help to set off the horror atmosphere of the game itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2Ff63f391f-0148-4864-abd4-49b178a30b9b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;f63f391f-0148-4864-abd4-49b178a30b9b.png"></p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Sometimes the quality of a map determines whether players can be retained. It plays a key role in the game. Good game settings need to be matched with appropriate map sizes. Some world views are suitable for grand maps, and some world views are suitable for exquisite maps. Regarding whether to design a small map, in general, in games with greater difficulty and some highly competitive games, it is necessary to have a small map. The former is to lower the threshold of the game, and the latter is because the focus of the game itself is not on the map. In any case, whether there is a small map, whether it is directly displayed or needs to be called to appear on the screen, is closely related to the game’s world view, gameplay, and attributes. Different designs will attract different players. Only when players learn how to read a map can they better understand a game, and they may be interested in continuing the game.</p>

<p>“Rockstar Games” is a game development subsidiary of the game publisher Take-Two Interactive. Many players may not be familiar with this company, but they must be very familiar with their most famous games, the <em>GTA</em> series and the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series. This New York-based video game company can be said to have produced many of the most famous video games of the 21st century. Games like the <em>GTA</em> series or the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series basically put players in a carefully designed open world. Whether it’s the American West in the late 18th and early 20th centuries, Miami in the 1980s, or Los Angeles (called Los Santos) in the 21st century, players can experience American life and Western culture at a specific time under the setting consistent with the real world. This article will take the <em>GTA</em> series and the <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series as examples to briefly discuss the unique experience that players can get under the open world system created by Rockstar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F77300db9-5218-4deb-98c8-5fe20514b7fa.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;77300db9-5218-4deb-98c8-5fe20514b7fa.png"></p>

<h2 id="Walk-into-History-from-the-Plot-and-Feel-the-Epitome-of-Culture"><a href="#Walk-into-History-from-the-Plot-and-Feel-the-Epitome-of-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Walk into History from the Plot and Feel the Epitome of Culture"></a>Walk into History from the Plot and Feel the Epitome of Culture</h2><p>When talking about the setting of the plot and the background of the times in Rockstar games, it is inseparable from Dan Houser, one of the founders of R Star. He used to be the chief screenwriter of R Star (he resigned on March 11, 2020) and participated in writing the background settings of almost all <em>GTA</em> series and all <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> series games. He once said in an interview, “The game may be a historical novel, but it is not a historical work.” Historical novels often leave a very deep impression on the public about historical figures or important historical periods, such as the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, which we are familiar with.</p>
<p>So what kind of American history does Rockstar’s game want to present to everyone? It is not difficult for us to find that basically every Rockstar game highlights the importance of crime in modern American history. Take the most classic <em>GTA: Vice City</em> as an example, the background setting is based on Miami in the 1980s. In the game, the protagonist Tommy Vercetti, played by the player, was imprisoned for 15 years for murder. After being released from prison, he gained connections and capital through various violent activities, and eventually became a prominent figure in “Vice City” by operating illegal industries under the guise of legality. Such a setting not only makes players feel excited, but also allows players to get a glimpse of two major characteristics of modern American history: greedy capitalism and serious gun violence. In almost all games in the <em>GTA</em> series, the characters played by players will use guns to create a world for themselves. It can be said that gun violence is the first perception of players when they first enter the game. At the same time, players can get a close look at the dark side behind the glamorous image of business tycoons through the plot, and then perceive greedy capitalism.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at Avery Carrington, a representative of the bourgeois upper class in <em>GTA: Vice City</em>, a successful real estate tycoon. In the game plot, the protagonist played by the player will be appreciated by him, and help him complete some special tasks to obtain high rewards. Special tasks include triggering gang wars between Cubans and Haitians to drive down房价 (fángjià - house prices), intimidating and murdering construction teams that refuse to sell land to him, etc. The greedy Avery Carrington will use any means to seek profit, and almost every generation of the GTA series will create some greedy business tycoon images for players, so that players can perceive the dark side behind capitalism while experiencing the plot. In real American history, Miami has always been a port for the drug trade. In the 1980s, the “War on Drugs” made the city full of blood and violence. Drug trafficking and gang wars were led by criminal gangs from Cuba, Haiti, Colombia and other South American places. In 1980 alone, there were 573 murders in the city, and 621 murders the following year. In <em>GTA: Vice City</em>, the various events that players encounter in the game are actually the epitome of various conflicts in society at that time, and the various characters they encounter are representatives of various classes and people from different countries at that time. The social conflicts and the historical culture of that specific period were all presented in the game in a condensed way. While giving players sufficient freedom, it also allows players who are willing to calm down and appreciate the plot to feel the unique characteristics of the society at that time.</p>

<h2 id="In-Depth-Experience-of-Radio-Stations"><a href="#In-Depth-Experience-of-Radio-Stations" class="headerlink" title="In-Depth Experience of Radio Stations"></a>In-Depth Experience of Radio Stations</h2><p>Each radio station in the <em>GTA</em> game, just like in real life, not only plays different types of music for players, but also features some call-in talk shows. In addition to the music itself, what many domestic players are likely to miss are the contents of some radio advertisements and call-in broadcasts. Today, let’s talk about how this part of the experience creates a more humorous, complete and real world for players.</p>
<p>Some NPC characters in the game often appear in the <em>GTA</em> series radio call-in programs. Such Easter egg settings not only make the characters in the game more plump, but also stimulate players’ stronger desire to explore in the open world game. The advertisements interspersed in the radio station also echo the unique personality of the <em>GTA</em> series games, which is based on satire and humor. <em>GTA3</em> satirized the real lifestyle of Americans through advertisements on the game’s radio station. For example, a certain advertisement mentioned that a large company in the sports shoe industry used child labor, but Americans said they didn’t care. The game used this to satirize the real American society. <em>GTA: Vice City</em> also attempted to satirize the intellectual issues often discussed on NPR (National Public Radio) through the radio station VCPR. And the absurd spoof of <em>GTA3</em>‘s iconic radio talk show Chatterbox is one of the most memorable parts of the GTA series for foreign players. The content setting is basically a satirical commentary on American culture in the early 21st century. The talk show in the game will receive calls from people living in nearby areas. People can freely talk about anything they think of, and these contents will receive humorous comments from Lazlow (the radio host). For example, there was a call from a woman complaining about the negative impact of video games on children. The woman said, “Life is not like a game without a restart button.” The host Lazlow immediately replied, “Life doesn’t have one, but my hotline does,” and immediately hung up on the woman. American humorous answers like this abound in this show. This sudden “fun spoof” seems to make foreign players discover a “new continent”, making players involuntarily experience this novel and real radio style.</p>
<p>The radio stations in the <em>GTA</em> series not only add a basic entertainment function for players, but the above content is more to supplement a more complete and real world, so as to stimulate players’ stronger desire for autonomous exploration in the game. Ultimately, in open world games, the more content players perceive autonomously, the more fun they will get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F635d3cdc-2d37-49cd-93e6-ad867146aeef.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;635d3cdc-2d37-49cd-93e6-ad867146aeef.png"></p>

<h2 id="Two-Way-and-Diverse-Interactive-Experience"><a href="#Two-Way-and-Diverse-Interactive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Two-Way and Diverse Interactive Experience"></a>Two-Way and Diverse Interactive Experience</h2><p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is Rockstar’s latest game after <em>GTA5</em>. Rockstar tried to make the open world of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> more realistic, and to make all actions in the game meaningful for players. When a player has an argument with a game NPC, the game provides some different interaction options. The player can threaten with a gun, shoot, or tie up with a rope. The player may only need to aggressively draw a gun and point it at him, and the NPC will stop unnecessary quarrels, of course, it may also be exchanged for the other party to draw a gun in self-defense. Therefore, the level of player experience becomes no longer binary, not just “Do I hit him or not?”. This way of interacting with NPCs in the game also depends on other factors: the player’s appearance, smell, reputation, and dress, etc. For example, if the player is wearing a neat cowboy outfit, then the interaction of passers-by will be relatively friendly. On the contrary, if the player is unkempt and covered in blood, then other people in the game will not want to have anything to do with you at all, and may even be scared to flee for fear of their lives. If a player has recently participated in a bar brawl and done something bad, a complete stranger will yell at the player, reminding people around him that the player did something bad not long ago. In the game, players can greet, threaten, or rob everyone in the world, so any character the player sees in the world is a potential interaction. The player’s every move in the world will give corresponding feedback. In a disguised way, all the player’s in-game behaviors are meaningful. Therefore, through two-way and diverse interaction methods, players can better experience the state of the character in the game world, and at the same time, they can express and understand more, more delicate and real emotions in the game.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Rockstar has developed and published a series of games that record modern American history, enabling players to feel the unique characteristics of the society at that time and some characteristics of American culture in the setting of the plot and background. Whether it is the radio station talk in the <em>GTA</em> series or the diversified interactive experience in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, it is to create a more real world, so that players can understand and express more real and delicate emotions. As much as possible, make all the player’s in-game behaviors more meaningful, so as to stimulate the player’s stronger desire for autonomous exploration in the open world game.</p>

<p>In user research, we often divide research methods into two categories: qualitative research and quantitative research. Qualitative research examines whether the research object has this or that attribute or characteristic, and whether there is a relationship between these attributes, through observation, experimentation, and analysis. Qualitative research consists of various methods such as interviews, observations, and case studies. Raw data includes interview records, photos, audio recordings, etc. The focus group that this article wants to introduce is a very classic method in qualitative research.</p>
<p>Previous articles have briefly introduced what a focus group is. Therefore, this article mainly compares focus groups with 1V1 interviews, analyzes the usage scenarios and advantages of focus groups. In addition, this article will also introduce how to apply focus groups and some tips for application.</p>
<h2 id="I-Usage-Scenarios-of-Focus-Groups"><a href="#I-Usage-Scenarios-of-Focus-Groups" class="headerlink" title="I. Usage Scenarios of Focus Groups"></a>I. Usage Scenarios of Focus Groups</h2><p>A focus group, also known as a focus group interview, is a small group discussion where a trained moderator interacts with a group of representative users in an unstructured, natural way to gain in-depth understanding of relevant issues.</p>
<p>The question is, since focus groups also involve talking with users, why use focus groups instead of 1V1 interviews? When is it more appropriate to use focus groups instead of 1V1 in-depth interviews to collect user feedback in the form of interviews?</p>
<p>Here, this article summarizes three scenarios where focus groups are applicable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When user discussion is needed:</strong> In some cases, we want users to communicate, exchange, and discuss with each other to generate more ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Time constraints:</strong> 1V1 in-depth interviews often take a lot of time. When research is limited to a short period of time, focus groups that can include multiple users at the same time are superior to 1V1 interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for observation:</strong> When product, operations, and marketing want to observe user feedback during the research process and obtain first-hand information, focus groups can provide more information in a shorter time compared to 1V1 in-depth interviews.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Different-Research-Objects-1V1-VS-Multiple-People"><a href="#Different-Research-Objects-1V1-VS-Multiple-People" class="headerlink" title="Different Research Objects: 1V1 VS Multiple People"></a>Different Research Objects: 1V1 VS Multiple People</h3><p>1V1 interviews, as the name suggests, use a model of one interviewer and one user&#x2F;interviewee. Focus groups use the form of seminars to guide users to discuss, which is a multi-person format. The number of research objects varies according to different topics. Generally, larger focus groups require 8-12 participants, medium-sized focus groups generally have 6-8 people, and small groups have 4-6 people.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the number of people in a focus group is more than that of a 1V1 interview, but it does not mean that conducting 6-8 1V1 interviews and conducting a 6-8 person focus group have the same effect. A focus group is not a superposition of 1V1 interviews.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Screening-Criteria-for-Research-Objects-Focusing-on-Research-Objectives-VS-Not-Caring-About-the-Same-Camp-or-Opposition-Based-on-Research-Objectives"><a href="#Different-Screening-Criteria-for-Research-Objects-Focusing-on-Research-Objectives-VS-Not-Caring-About-the-Same-Camp-or-Opposition-Based-on-Research-Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Different Screening Criteria for Research Objects: Focusing on Research Objectives VS Not Caring About the Same Camp or Opposition Based on Research Objectives"></a>Different Screening Criteria for Research Objects: Focusing on Research Objectives VS Not Caring About the Same Camp or Opposition Based on Research Objectives</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, we often screen users according to different test purposes. Commonly used screening indicators include age, gender, occupation, game experience, etc. Focus groups are no exception. The primary condition for screening is to focus on research objectives. However, focus groups do not exclude users with opposing views. That is, the users invited to the focus group may be a group of users with similar views, but users with opposing attitudes and views may be invited. Because, whether the views are similar or opposed, as long as effective communication and discussion can be generated.</p>
<p>Similar&#x2F;opposite views can be used as subjects of focus groups, which further emphasizes that focus groups are not simply gathering 1V1 interview users for interviews, but selecting appropriate users around the research objectives to let them communicate.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Forms-of-Conversation-Interaction-Between-the-Interviewer-and-the-User-VS-Interaction-Between-Users"><a href="#Different-Forms-of-Conversation-Interaction-Between-the-Interviewer-and-the-User-VS-Interaction-Between-Users" class="headerlink" title="Different Forms of Conversation: Interaction Between the Interviewer and the User VS Interaction Between Users"></a>Different Forms of Conversation: Interaction Between the Interviewer and the User VS Interaction Between Users</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, the interviewer and the user have a question-and-answer relationship, and the interviewer tries to inspire the user to express their views. In a focus group, the focus is on communication and interaction between users. Different from 1V1 in-depth interviews where users express their views individually, users in focus groups can compare their views with those of others, and further trigger attitudes of agreement&#x2F;opposition, and continue to output views.</p>
<p>Compared with 1V1 interviews that focus on the interaction between the interviewer and the user, focus groups pay more attention to the interaction between users.</p>
<h3 id="Different-Roles-of-the-Interviewer-in-the-Test-Frequent-Communication-and-Exchange-VS-Ability-to-Control-the-Scene"><a href="#Different-Roles-of-the-Interviewer-in-the-Test-Frequent-Communication-and-Exchange-VS-Ability-to-Control-the-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Different Roles of the Interviewer in the Test: Frequent Communication and Exchange VS Ability to Control the Scene"></a>Different Roles of the Interviewer in the Test: Frequent Communication and Exchange VS Ability to Control the Scene</h3><p>In 1V1 interviews, we hope that the interviewer can communicate and exchange with the user relatively frequently during the interview process, keenly perceive the user’s psychological changes, and explore the user’s true thoughts. In a focus group, the interviewer needs to have good control skills to encourage all participants to actively join the discussion of the topic. Do not deviate from the topic, do not cause quarrels, and ensure that the topic is not led by “opinion leaders”.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared with 1V1 interviews, the advantages of focus groups are:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can collect information and data from more users in a relatively short period of time, which is more “economical” than 1V1 in-depth interviews.</li>
<li>They are more conducive to discovering user needs, attitudes, and reasons for attitudes: Thanks to group communication, users can have more inspiration and divergence when expressing their opinions, and the content generated can also obtain a direct comparison of attitudes on a topic through the collision of ideas between different users, which greatly enriches the views collected by researchers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="III-Application-of-Focus-Groups-and-Small-Tips"><a href="#III-Application-of-Focus-Groups-and-Small-Tips" class="headerlink" title="III. Application of Focus Groups and Small Tips"></a>III. Application of Focus Groups and Small Tips</h2><p>Having understood the usage scenarios and advantages of focus groups, how should focus groups be conducted? Are there any tips?</p>
<p>First, in the preparation stage before the implementation of the focus group, the following can be done:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Determine Research Objectives</strong></td>
<td>Clearly define the goals and questions the focus group aims to address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Develop Interview Questions</strong></td>
<td>Prepare open-ended questions that encourage discussion and exploration of the topic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recruit Users</strong></td>
<td>Select participants who meet the criteria and represent the target audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Choose Venue</strong></td>
<td>Select a comfortable and conducive environment for discussion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prepare Materials</strong></td>
<td>Gather necessary materials such as name tags, recording equipment, and any stimuli for the discussion.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In this preparation stage, there are many things worth noting. The most noteworthy thing is that when determining the interview questions, it is necessary to clarify that different questions should be raised at different stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm-up questions before the start:</strong> Do not involve privacy, hope to encourage everyone to discuss.</li>
<li><strong>General questions:</strong> Start with the user’s life&#x2F;work habits and guide them into the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>In-depth questions:</strong> Deeply explore user needs.</li>
<li><strong>Concluding questions:</strong> You can ask users to summarize and supplement the discussion content to ensure that the user’s expression is received.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, recruiting users requires pre-establishing recruitment standards and the proportion of users of different types, choosing a venue requires cross-arranging seats for users with different backgrounds, and preparing materials including name tags, audio and video recording tools, etc., which will not be repeated.</p>
<p>In the implementation process after the preparation stage, there are the following links:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Introduction</strong></td>
<td>Moderator introduces themselves, the purpose of the focus group, and ground rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Discussion</strong></td>
<td>Moderator guides the discussion using the prepared questions, encouraging all participants to contribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Observation</strong></td>
<td>Assistant observes and records user behavior, interactions, and key comments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wrap-up</strong></td>
<td>Moderator summarizes the discussion and thanks participants.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the implementation phase, the overall discussion process requires assistants to observe and record user-related situations.</p>
<p>How to observe? It is necessary to observe the user’s attitude changes, the user’s product usage, and the user’s opposition. We can also use video recording to ensure the integrity of the video data with the user’s consent.</p>
<p>How to record? The user’s original words should be recorded verbatim, pay attention to the name and order of the speaker, and non-verbal behaviors should also be recorded. Here is also a small trick we use in the implementation process - sharing first-hand information using shared documents and other means. Why is this? In the research process, we often use a combination of various research methods, such as adding questionnaires to focus groups. Shared documents allow the interviewer to see the user’s answers for the first time, and guide the focus group based on the answers.</p>
<p>Focus groups are a commonly used qualitative research method, but the preparation and implementation process is somewhat complicated. Before we use it, we should clarify that we want to use focus groups instead of other methods, and what kind of information we want to obtain, so as not to complicate simple problems, and also to let focus groups play a greater role in suitable scenarios.</p>

    <title>Decrypting the Combat Experience of Idle Games</title>
    <url>/2021/10/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20211119_28584_986724/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211119/28584_986724.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Idle games, when combined with combat gameplay, usually appear in the form of RPG games. They automatically collect resources, automatically fight, and even skip the battle process for one-click tower climbing. Without considering interactive animations and sound effects, idle games almost return the operating feel of combat to the era of chess games, abandoning the stimulation of dopamine and adrenaline in action battles. Players hardly need to operate to defeat enemies and win battles. Player actions seem to be marginalized. So, where does the pleasure of combat in idle games come from?</p>
<h2 id="1-Combat-Mechanism"><a href="#1-Combat-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="1. Combat Mechanism"></a>1. Combat Mechanism</h2><p>Before answering this question, let’s talk about the combat mechanism of idle games. The purpose of the combat system design of idle games is mainly to verify the player’s growth, bring the fun of confrontation and social value, and cause empathy between the player and the character through combat. Like the battles of most RPG games, the battles of idle games also have rich combat mechanisms. Battles can be real-time, semi-real-time, or turn-based; players can control a single character or a team; characters have fixed positions or can move freely; the victory conditions of the game can rely on the numerical crushing of the cultivation system or the proficiency of the player’s operation… But before designing these rules, it is first necessary to clarify what kind of combat experience the game wants to bring. For example, <em>A Mobile Immortal</em> (一念逍遥) wants to express the realm of cultivators of different levels through combat. Its idle combat is not the team pushing tower of heroes, but借鉴《球球大作战》’s expression method shows the entire cultivation world, using the intuitive area comparison of large and small balls to show the qualitative change of the realm, bringing players the feeling of crushing and despising all beings. <em>Fantastic Planet</em> (妙奇星球) strives to create a relaxed and pleasant adventure atmosphere, and the combat is deliberately weakened. The single-line combat and the enemy design with weak offensive performance reduce the tension of the battle.</p>

<h2 id="2-Multi-dimensional-Decision-making"><a href="#2-Multi-dimensional-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="2. Multi-dimensional Decision-making"></a>2. Multi-dimensional Decision-making</h2><p>From the perspective of process analysis, in the main line combat mode, the player’s behavior is generally to build a hero lineup before the battle, manually or automatically release hero skills during the battle, watch the battle process, succeed and harvest the spoils to continue the next level of battle, fail and adjust or strengthen the hero lineup; while the hero automatically fights, the game settles the battle data, and then presents the result. The player’s behavior is mainly concentrated on the pre-war lineup construction, and the development and results of the entire battle, various battle details, spoils, etc. are the results derived from the player’s decision-making lineup. From the perspective of the operation-feedback experience design principle, the player’s operating behavior is simplified, but the decision-making results are extremely strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="Pre-battle-Decision-making"><a href="#Pre-battle-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="Pre-battle Decision-making"></a>Pre-battle Decision-making</h3><p>Taking <em>AFK Arena</em> as an example, players choose 5 heroes from the existing heroes to form a combination for a 5v5 battle. The battle lineup is an unequal position of 2 in the front and 3 in the back, and the attack target selection follows the principle of the nearest priority within the range. After changing the character’s position, due to the difference in attributes, the total output and damage taken by the character will also change, thereby changing the entire battle situation. In the lineup decision-making, players need to consider the influencing factors of 5 dimensions, including front and rear, up and down positions, skill sets, racial restraint, racial bonuses, and cultivation level (proficiency) differences, and skill set matching. Players can adjust the position or replace the hero to form a clearance lineup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F8dccbad0-0f8f-4f13-bb6b-46302feeadb6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;8dccbad0-0f8f-4f13-bb6b-46302feeadb6.png"></p>

<p>In order to optimize the player’s decision-making experience and minimize the difficulty and operating steps of decision-making, the hero selection interface of traditional idle combat games will show the scene of the two sides facing each other to render the atmosphere, express the sense of confrontation through a symmetrical layout, and at the same time display the combat power information of both sides, which is convenient for players to choose or upgrade heroes. Use quantified values to visually express the combat power of both sides, including the level, combat power, and total combat power of each character. Heroes are classified by attributes, sorted by level, and screened out commonly used formations or the strongest combat power to reduce the amount of thinking and operation of players. Explanations of the battle rules will be hidden by buttons, which is convenient for players to quickly understand the rules.</p>
<h3 id="In-battle-Decision-making"><a href="#In-battle-Decision-making" class="headerlink" title="In-battle Decision-making"></a>In-battle Decision-making</h3><p>The player’s behavior during the battle is mainly to release character skills at the right time. Generally, players need to choose automatic or manual release. Some games directly remove the manual option and convert the skills into buffs, which simplifies the game process while saving art resources. In order to speed up the battle process, players can choose the playback speed of the battle animation. Manual combat is to manually select the timing of skill release. The skill cooldown is visualized graphically, and the character state changes after the cooldown to indicate that the skill is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2Fa13c0f8e-20b6-480d-ae4f-41df584aeb39.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;a13c0f8e-20b6-480d-ae4f-41df584aeb39.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-Combat-Performance"><a href="#3-Combat-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3. Combat Performance"></a>3. Combat Performance</h2><h3 id="Skill-Performance"><a href="#Skill-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Skill Performance"></a>Skill Performance</h3><p>After the own character takes a certain amount of damage or after a period of cooling time, the highlighted character symbol indicates that the big move is ready. When clicking to release the big move, time is frozen, and the screen is focused by means of translucent masks, zooming in on the character, etc., to strengthen the visual performance and thus fully demonstrate the own combat power, Enhance positive operating feedback, the skill animation is not interrupted, ensuring the smooth release of our hero skills; while the enemy is treated differently, time is not frozen, and it is not highlighted, so as not to interrupt the player’s combat experience. The cutscene of the big move also makes the whole battle process more ups and downs, and players don’t have to just watch the hero fight.</p>
<p>The animation time of skill release is limited. This is the result of balancing a single performance and the idle combat experience. Because no matter how cool the animation is, it is difficult to bring continuous stimulation and freshness after repeated multiple times, but it destroys the game experience. <em>Doomsday Crusader</em> (拂晓的拾荒原), as a two-dimensional battle, has expressive advantages and good art resources, but the animation time of its skills is also strictly controlled, and the animation duration is less than 1 second after double-speed battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2F2c27faf1-0e16-4490-b1e7-c148396eaa2b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;2c27faf1-0e16-4490-b1e7-c148396eaa2b.png"></p>

<h3 id="Number-Pop-Up-Strategy"><a href="#Number-Pop-Up-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Number Pop-Up Strategy"></a>Number Pop-Up Strategy</h3><p>The types of information carried by number pop-ups include damage values, healing values, critical damage, buffs, evasion kills, and other status information. In order for this information to be clearly conveyed, the design will use color, font size, font, appearance time, duration, speed and other characteristics to distinguish.</p>
<p>For the battle between two multi-hero camps, players generally cannot accept a large amount of numerical and status information in fast-paced battles, especially instant battles inevitably develop into melees. The number pop-ups in this type of game combat give up allowing players to accurately receive data, but reflect the battle situation through a large number of rapid number pop-ups, emphasizing the feedback output of our side, and achieving the role of combat to verify the player’s growth. For example, in <em>AFK Arena</em>, although it is an instant battle, the number pop-ups do not appear with the attack, but a turn-based strategy is adopted. The damage values taken by the whole field appear synchronously at a time point in an end time, reducing the chaos of the battle screen.</p>
<p>The slower-paced turn-based combat can better avoid the problem of chaotic numerical information. The damage output number pop-ups appear sequentially after the character attacks, and the position is fixed, and the player can clearly receive the information. The battle of controlling a single character presents less information, and players can accurately receive it, and the number pop-ups can be extremely exaggerated in value. A typical example is the Demon Suppressing Tower battle of <em>A Mobile Immortal</em>, which has an exaggerated unit of measurement after its data, exaggerating the value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211119%2Fd2b8527f-6541-4c74-b9dd-1cb74afa3b35.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211119&#x2F;d2b8527f-6541-4c74-b9dd-1cb74afa3b35.png"></p>

Combat Rhythm</h2><h3 id="Battle-Duration"><a href="#Battle-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Battle Duration"></a>Battle Duration</h3><p>The battle duration of a single level of idle games is generally controlled within a short period of time, and the number of levels is large. This is because as a battle to verify growth, players get less experience in gameplay and can hardly tolerate a long period of boring waiting. The main purpose of the battle is to provide instant feedback, and numerous levels can provide multiple feedbacks at shorter intervals. This nature determines the fast pace of idle game battles. In addition to controlling the value of the life and output of both sides, the game can speed up the duration of a single game by simplifying decision-making steps and difficulty, doubling the speed of combat animation, shortening skill animation, and setting up automatic combat.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>To output a combat experience that conforms to the game style in a short period of time, it requires the cooperation of game mechanics, visual effects performance, interaction design, etc. Clarify the content of the experience output, and then shorten the battle duration and operating steps, exaggerate and strengthen the audiovisual output, even if there are few operations and short time, it can also output the best audiovisual experience effect.</p>

    <title>Adding a Sense of Surprise to the Player Experience: Easter Egg Design in Games</title>

<p>Game design is an art, an art full of mystery. All artists will more or less give their works some small secrets, and game designers are no exception. These “little secrets” in the game are what we often call Easter eggs.</p>
<h2 id="I-What-are-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#I-What-are-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="I. What are Easter Eggs?"></a>I. What are Easter Eggs?</h2><p>Easter eggs are some interesting secrets hidden in the game that game makers deliberately leave for players during the game design process. They can be text messages, props, extra tasks, or other various strange designs. These seemingly irrelevant secret Easter eggs and hidden elements often play a key finishing touch.</p>
<p>Easter eggs are now almost standard in games. Developers are used to hiding things everywhere, and players can always find them all - as long as there are enough players of that game, nothing is impossible. Next, let’s count some interesting Easter eggs in the game.</p>
<h3 id="The-“Clay-Figure”-Item-in-Justice-Online"><a href="#The-“Clay-Figure”-Item-in-Justice-Online" class="headerlink" title="The “Clay Figure” Item in Justice Online"></a>The “Clay Figure” Item in <em>Justice Online</em></h3><p>Many <em>Justice Online</em> players will have the [Clay Figure] item. The item description says: Right-click me one hundred times and I will level you up. Many players clicked 100 times and did not level up. In fact, this is a prank Easter egg.</p>

<h2 id="II-Why-Have-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#II-Why-Have-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="II. Why Have Easter Eggs?"></a>II. Why Have Easter Eggs?</h2><p>The earliest game Easter egg was designed by a programmer named Warren Robinett. Due to his dissatisfaction with the company Atari’s oppressive policies, he designed a hidden level in the game, which wrote Created By Warren Robinett. After this Easter egg was discovered, the company could no longer recall the game cartridges due to cost and public opinion. They could only make the best of a bad bargain. They let the existing products be, and told interested players that their future games would have such small secrets, just like Easter eggs, for players to find and enjoy.</p>
<p>In the early days, the graphics of games were extremely simple. If you wanted to make some “hidden content”, you could only directly manipulate the code. With the advancement of technology, Easter eggs have become an important part of the game today, and their forms are also diverse and changeable. So why should there be Easter eggs in games?</p>
<p>People need motivation to achieve certain needs, and some needs take precedence over others. This is what we most often call the five levels of needs: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization. After satisfying the most basic deficiency needs, we step into the higher-level growth needs, that is, the satisfaction in the spiritual form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2Fcde91a0f-c752-4b2d-b490-b2a53a7eddf6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211209&#x2F;cde91a0f-c752-4b2d-b490-b2a53a7eddf6.png"></p>
<p>Correspondingly, for games, it can be divided into four levels from low to high: functionality, reliability, usability, and pleasure. The top level, “pleasure”, includes the emotional needs in the theory of human needs.</p>
<p>Compared with other Internet products, games should pay more attention to the entire process and gradual experience of player experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2F29ed2ff1-52ae-4fa6-82c7-51d827251ff0.png/size/" alt="Functionality, Reliability, Usability and Pleasure"></p>
<p>The experience design of Internet products pays more attention to usability and needs to help users achieve their goals smoothly. For games, it is necessary to bring surprises to players and prevent them from playing the game in a rigid manner. An unchanging game will keep the player’s emotional fluctuations within a relatively stable range. A fun game will inevitably bring changes in the player’s experience. In other words, in addition to usability, the game experience must start from the player’s motivation and emotion. After ensuring the most basic usability, it is necessary to make players’ emotions change and try to add points in terms of pleasure.</p>
<p>And Easter eggs bring this kind of added surprise.</p>
<p>When players have expectations for the game, if the results during the experience far exceed expectations, players will have a strong sense of surprise. Making players’ seemingly impossible wishes come true also creates positive emotional experiences such as a sense of surprise. A sense of surprise is a particularly emotional element, and it is difficult for players to separate it when they experience the game.</p>
<p>Adding some relatively “clever” designs to the game will also make it easier for players to feel surprised. When the player is playing and then sees an Easter egg, they can’t help but laugh and say, “Oh, look at this designer.” Sometimes, such a small Easter egg may be enough to touch the player and make them resonate emotionally with the game.</p>
<p>For game designers, if they add some of their own elements when making a game, such as Easter eggs, then the designer will have a more personal connection with this game and will also be more attentive to it. It’s like it’s their own game, not just a development project they’re involved in. The same is true for players. As mentioned above, emotional resonance. As a player, when I find Easter eggs in a game, the game has a special meaning to me. I can feel the real traces left by the developers behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="III-How-to-Design-Easter-Eggs"><a href="#III-How-to-Design-Easter-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="III. How to Design Easter Eggs"></a>III. How to Design Easter Eggs</h2><p>However, due to the hidden nature of Easter eggs, it is difficult to guarantee that players will definitely see these attempts at emotional resonance, which also creates great cost pressure. For a game, how to design Easter eggs becomes a problem.</p>
<p>From the perspective of user experience, the following factors need to be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the right time and place according to the type of game. It should not affect the main process, nor should it make users feel out of place or unable to find it.</li>
<li>Pay attention to players to find design inspiration. Different players have different needs. Understand what players want and what are the extra points, so that the designed Easter eggs are valuable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current mainstream design methods include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<h3 id="Homage-Developers-use-Easter-eggs-to-pay-tribute-to-classic-games"><a href="#Homage-Developers-use-Easter-eggs-to-pay-tribute-to-classic-games" class="headerlink" title="Homage: Developers use Easter eggs to pay tribute to classic games"></a>Homage: Developers use Easter eggs to pay tribute to classic games</h3><p>Developers are originally game players. The game production process is actually a reproduction of the developers’ ideas, and the ideas themselves are largely derived from other games. Whether it is the game of the project team next door or the masterpiece of other companies, if these game experiences have more or less influenced the developers, it is also a good way to express respect by bringing some of their signs into the game.</p>
<h3 id="Explore-the-game-world-and-plot"><a href="#Explore-the-game-world-and-plot" class="headerlink" title="Explore the game world and plot"></a>Explore the game world and plot</h3><p>Use Easter eggs to bury details throughout the game process, leaving them for players to discover and discuss. If the Easter eggs are designed properly, the player’s desire to explore can provide more online time for the game. In addition to spending time on the main line, players will also spend time exploring the game world. Once players find an Easter egg, they will feel that the game world is suddenly enlightened. To a certain extent, Easter eggs make the game world appear larger, encouraging players to explore carefully everywhere instead of taking a quick glance.</p>
<h3 id="Unexpected-interactions"><a href="#Unexpected-interactions" class="headerlink" title="Unexpected interactions"></a>Unexpected interactions</h3><p>This type of Easter egg usually does not follow the usual rules to bring an unexpected experience, making players exclaim “Can it be like this?”</p>
<p>It gives people an unexpected feeling, exceeding players’ expectations of the original content. Players will think, “Wow, there must be more of this kind of stuff,” and the game therefore appears to be richer.</p>
<h3 id="Self-promotion-of-the-game"><a href="#Self-promotion-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Self-promotion of the game"></a>Self-promotion of the game</h3><p>The human touch and gameplay revealed in the Easter eggs are actually a promotion of the game itself. In layman’s terms, it is to make players feel the conscience of this game.</p>
<p>If the Easter egg is designed with enough depth, it will naturally drive operational interaction outside the game. Players may discuss various details in the game on online forums or offline, thereby generating unexpected promotional effects for the game.</p>
<p>Easter eggs are like chiseling carefully on a piece of marble without knowing whether anyone can observe these strokes, but a wonderful work of art has already been carefully crafted.</p>

    <title>Still Using Font Icons? Try Building an SVG Icon Library</title>
    <url>/2021/12/06/netease-ux-articles/news_20211209_28584_990922/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211209/28584_990922.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="I-Background"><a href="#I-Background" class="headerlink" title="I. Background"></a>I. Background</h2><p>SVG is an image file format, the full name is Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a text file based on XML syntax. Most other image formats are based on pixel processing, so SVG does not distort like other image formats when enlarged.</p>
<p>Compared with PNG and JPEG images, SVG has a smaller size, stronger compressibility, and is scalable. It can be enlarged without losing image quality. It has an open standard and can be used to represent graphics, filters, animations, etc. It also has a very long history. It became a W3C standard in 2003, and mainstream browsers support SVG.</p>
<p>In practical work, SVG is very suitable for static image display, high-fidelity document viewing and printing, and other scenarios. Since SVG is described based on XML syntax, it is convenient to change the XML description, such as Path, Line, color, size, etc., to achieve the effect of changing SVG icons. Designers only need to produce one SVG image, which can be changed in size, color, animation, etc., and used in multiple places on the page.</p>
<h2 id="II-Disadvantages-of-the-icon-font-Solution"><a href="#II-Disadvantages-of-the-icon-font-Solution" class="headerlink" title="II. Disadvantages of the icon-font Solution"></a>II. Disadvantages of the icon-font Solution</h2><p>IconFont is a well-known, powerful SVG open-source library with very rich icon content in China. In addition, there are some common open-source SVG libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Font Awesome</li>
<li>Iconicons</li>
<li>css.gg</li>
<li>Featheroicons</li>
<li>Eva Icons</li>
<li>Heroicon</li>
<li>Bootstrap iconsl</li>
<li>Remix icons</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>These commonly used SVG open-source libraries have a very large SVG icon resource.</p>
<p>In the actual development process, the process of accessing and using these SVG resources is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2Ff430ac3b-7bf5-4a5a-8123-e8796246b0be.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211209&#x2F;f430ac3b-7bf5-4a5a-8123-e8796246b0be.png"></p>
<p>This method has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation steps are cumbersome. Every time the icon is updated, it is necessary to go through all the above processes again.</li>
<li>It is impossible to form a standard, and it cannot be reused between different projects. Projects can only be repeatedly copied; there is no entry to query the SVGs that the company already has.</li>
<li>It needs the help of a third-party website and is strongly dependent on the third-party websites mentioned above. There are security risks in uploading internal SVGs of the company.</li>
<li>The actual use is to package all icons into a font file and introduce them through class+css, which cannot be loaded on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these drawbacks, we would prefer to have an SVG component library with unified standards, reusability, independence from third-party websites, support for on-demand loading, and easier access, use, maintenance, and expansion.</p>
<h2 id="III-Solution-Research"><a href="#III-Solution-Research" class="headerlink" title="III. Solution Research"></a>III. Solution Research</h2><h3 id="SVG-Sprite"><a href="#SVG-Sprite" class="headerlink" title="SVG Sprite"></a>SVG Sprite</h3><p>Webpack svg-sprite-loader supports merging SVG files into an SVG sprite and loading them into an element with display: none. When using it, pass in the id of the icon to render the icon. This solution supports on-demand loading and packaging.</p>
<h3 id="SVG-To-React"><a href="#SVG-To-React" class="headerlink" title="SVG To React"></a>SVG To React</h3><p>Webpack svg-react-loader supports directly requiring an SVG image. Users only need to simply configure webpack to use it directly.</p>
<h3 id="Convert-SVG-to-React-Component"><a href="#Convert-SVG-to-React-Component" class="headerlink" title="Convert SVG to React Component"></a>Convert SVG to React Component</h3><p>If the SVG Sprite and SVG To React solutions are placed in an independent component library, the business needs to configure the loader to process the files of node_modules. For these two methods, there are shortcomings in the ease of use of the component library.</p>
<p>Therefore, consider converting each independent SVG in the component library into a pure React component, rendering and returning the XML of the SVG, and passing in Props to change the SVG.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Development-Implementation"><a href="#IV-Development-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="IV. Development Implementation"></a>IV. Development Implementation</h2><p>Re-sort the above solution ideas and clarify what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an independent SVG component library to store common SVG images</li>
<li>Convert each SVG into an independent React Component</li>
<li>Compile and build each React Component to support business on-demand introduction</li>
</ol>
<p>We mainly introduce 2 and 3</p>

<p>At this point, the independent svg library that supports on-demand loading has been built. After publishing the svg component library to the npm repository, it can be referenced in a very convenient and convenient way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To add a new svg, just add the svg to the component library and execute the convert and build commands.</li>

<li>Companies often have their own common SVG Icons. Precipitating these SVG Icons into a component library can facilitate real-time access by designers, product managers, and developers;</li>
<li>The idea of building an SVG library is mainly reflected in converting SVG into an independent React Component, and then outputting the corresponding esm and cjs formats of the React Component;</li>
<li>The public SVG library can simplify the svg usage of icon font, and developers can easily change the svg; it can also unify and standardize the use and style of Icons in various products.</li>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Under the current social and technological conditions, especially with remote work during the pandemic, people have long accepted and recognized the communication method of “not being physically present together”. The virtual situation, also “not being physically present”, no longer gives people a false feeling. Instead, it is a situation with sufficient interaction capabilities and even can meet certain social needs. The “socialization” of games has become an obvious trend. Interactions within the game context (virtual character draws, appearance displays, ranking announcements, etc.) enhance players’ immersion in the virtual world and their self-identification in the game, thereby trusting the game world and generating a sense of dependence and companionship, thus achieving emotional connection.</p>

After entering the game context and accepting the rules, you will be given a specific value and informed of a clear evaluation system. As a result, the differences and stratification between you and other players are inevitable. Taking the card RPG mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> as an example, under the battle mechanism, the sense of accomplishment brought by victory, the sense of conquest brought by duels, and even the sense of loss after failure will provide players with strong emotional energy, and rankings and tiers will also give players clear level differences, thereby enhancing players’ dependence and identification with this game context.</p>

<p>A game often takes no more than 3 minutes. Frequent participation will strengthen the participant’s identification with their player identity, and then pursue their self-identification in this “small society”. After generating identity, pursuing differentiation becomes the player’s only choice. Drawing “legendary” level cards, obtaining better wands, card upgrades, costumes, etc., this pursuit of symbolic differences and instrumental purposes, in turn, creates players’ emotional connection with the game context.</p>
<h3 id="Role-Identity-Based-on-Virtual-Objects"><a href="#Role-Identity-Based-on-Virtual-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Role Identity Based on Virtual Objects"></a>Role Identity Based on Virtual Objects</h3><p>Designers of nurturing games will reconstruct virtual characters in multiple ways. This beloved character often has a rich backstory and exquisite character art, and shows more or less affection for the role played by the player. Players will have a lot of shared experiences with virtual characters through their own perspective, or learn the “unknown” secrets of virtual characters from a bystander’s perspective that only the role played by the player knows. Strategies such as physical participation restrictions and CV dubbing in the game enhance the realism of virtual characters. The complete interaction ritual chain strengthens the player’s identification with the game context and virtual characters.</p>

<p>Games with elements of simulation, strategy, role-playing, and social interaction will create a high degree of mutual subjectivity between players and virtual characters through interaction with NPCs or the main storyline, enhancing players’ identification with the game context and virtual characters. In <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, NPC residents are designed to have feelings. When players have not logged in to the game for a long time, the game world is also running smoothly. When the player logs in again, the NPC residents will also greet them like old friends in reality, thus further creating a sense of participation for the player that “in the process of playing the game, I feel that I am integrated with the people or things in the game”.</p>

Some players start a new game and invest energy and resources because the game can be used as a social means to facilitate participants to integrate into different groups. When a game becomes popular, people who don’t know or haven’t played it are likely to become “social orphans”. There are also many players who obtain emotional support through the game experience to achieve a good state in real life and work.</p>

Emotional Connection where Three Types Interact</h2><p>Players first actively or passively participate in the game context due to personal preferences or social needs, and these three types of identification work independently or together. Driven by a sense of identity, players make virtual consumption in the game, and complete the reproduction of emotional connection in continuous participation. Players’ continuous participation in the game context is precisely the process of production and reproduction of three types of identification, and the three types of emotional connection are cause and effect in different specific situations.</p>
<p>In the MMORPG world, players enter and participate in game activities as virtual characters. The character is the incarnation of the player himself. When interacting in online games, players exist in virtual identities, have self-identification with the character, and have role-identification with other character images that promote the development of the plot. The exquisite graphics and rich plot design in MMORPG games have prompted players to interact with scenery screenshots and character selfie screenshots in the game, and even some players will make game content into video clips and post them on social media platforms to show other players their own stories in the game. Such short videos not only embody the player’s image in the game, but also derive a multi-faceted display of the player’s game skill level, game experience, and even economic capital investment. The more likes and comments, the more players can gain a sense of superiority in the game group, thus generating the reproduction of emotional connection.</p>

What is more attractive than content and plot are emotional factors. In the process of being in the game, players can further have the desire to explore because of the stimulation of emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and these emotional energies are also the deep purpose of players’ investment in the game. Only by achieving emotional connection and the reproduction of emotional connection can the game firmly grasp the user’s heart.</p>

    <title>Recommendation Systems: The MAB Problem and Bandit Algorithms</title>
    <url>/2021/11/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20211209_28584_990929/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211209/28584_990929.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recommendation systems, it is necessary to find a balance between exploration (exploring unknown areas) and exploitation (exploiting existing knowledge), which is the Exploit-Explore problem. Exploitation can be understood as recommending things that users are definitely interested in, while exploration can be understood as trying to discover users’ new interests. Otherwise, repeatedly recommending things that users are interested in will make users feel fatigued. However, constantly exploring new interests will inevitably affect the user’s click-through rate. Making trade-offs between exploration and exploitation is a challenge in developing recommendation systems.</p>
<h2 id="I-The-MAB-Problem"><a href="#I-The-MAB-Problem" class="headerlink" title="I. The MAB Problem"></a>I. The MAB Problem</h2><p>In fact, the above problem can be abstracted as an MAB problem (Multi-armed bandit problem). As the name suggests, it originated in casinos.  A gambler enters a casino and there are multiple slot machines. Each slot machine has a different probability of winning.  How can the gambler learn the winning distribution of each machine and develop a strategy to maximize profit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2Fb4a85839-b998-4c7c-ad72-0397fa1c4157.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211209&#x2F;b4a85839-b998-4c7c-ad72-0397fa1c4157.png"></p>
<h2 id="II-Bandit-Algorithms"><a href="#II-Bandit-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="II. Bandit Algorithms"></a>II. Bandit Algorithms</h2><p>To solve this problem, you can try using Bandit algorithms. Bandit algorithms are actually a general term for a class of algorithms. The basic idea can be summarized in two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a choice, if the number of experiments is large enough and the return is greater, then we are more inclined to choose it, and vice versa.</li>
<li>For a choice, if the number of experiments is too small to determine whether the choice is good or bad, then try it a few more times until its quality is determined.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="III-Thompson-Sampling-Algorithm"><a href="#III-Thompson-Sampling-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="III. Thompson Sampling Algorithm"></a>III. Thompson Sampling Algorithm</h2><p>Due to space limitations, this article only introduces a common Bandit algorithm: the Thompson sampling algorithm. Its principle is: in the candidate pool, the revenue generated by choosing each item follows a separate probability distribution. Each time a selection is made, a random number is generated from the probability distribution of each item.  Finally, the item corresponding to the largest random number is recommended.</p>
<p>This probability distribution is the Beta distribution. Its probability distribution function is shown below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20211209%2F0380abed-d53b-46c3-8b79-5777e75552f7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20211209&#x2F;0380abed-d53b-46c3-8b79-5777e75552f7.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Beta distribution has two parameters, α and β, which determine the shape of the distribution curve:</p>
<ol>
<li>When α + β is larger, the curve will be narrower and the distribution will be more concentrated. Conversely, the curve will be wider and the distribution will be more dispersed.</li>
<li>When α &#x2F; (α + β) is larger, the center position of the distribution is closer to 1, and vice versa, it is closer to 0.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Applying this characteristic of the Beta distribution to the recommendation system, the number of times a user clicks on an item is regarded as the parameter α, and the number of times it is recommended but not clicked is regarded as the parameter β. Then there can be the following 3 situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>When α + β of an item is large enough (the number of times it has been recommended is large enough), its distribution will be very narrow, that is, we are already very sure of the return of recommending this item. At this time, the return generated according to the Beta distribution is close to its average return.</li>
<li>When α + β of an item is large enough and α &#x2F; (α + β) is larger (the number of times it has been recommended is large enough and the user’s click-through rate is very high), it means that its Beta distribution is narrow enough and closer to 1.  Random numbers generated according to this distribution tend to be larger, and thus it is more likely to be recommended.</li>
<li>When α + β of an item is very small (the number of times it has been recommended is very small), because the distribution curve it generates is very wide, it is possible to generate a larger random number, and thus be selected for recommendation. This plays the role of exploration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="IV-Summary"><a href="#IV-Summary" class="headerlink" title="IV. Summary"></a>IV. Summary</h2><p>Bandit algorithms are a general term for a class of algorithms that can be used to solve the MAB problem of recommendation systems. In fact, it can also be used to solve the cold start problem, which is left for readers to think about. In addition to the Thompson sampling algorithm, common Bandit algorithms also include the UCB algorithm, the Epsilon-greedy algorithm, and others.</p>

    <title>What is the &quot;Metaverse&quot; in the Eyes of Game Developers?</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20211209/28584_990945.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>“This is the Oasis, a whole virtual universe. The only limit here is your own imagination.” - <em>Ready Player One</em></p>
<p>In 2018, the movie <em>Ready Player One</em> was released. Director Steven Spielberg presented an seemingly absurd yet fascinating world to the audience: when people put on VR glasses, they can enter this virtual world that contrasts sharply with the real world - this is the new world called “Oasis”. This virtual world has bustling cities and an independent economic system. You can be anyone and do anything. Even if you are a loser struggling on the fringes of society in reality. Take a leap, and you can still become a superhero in the “Oasis”.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that three years later, the “Metaverse,” based on <em>Ready Player One</em>, would become the hottest concept in the global investment circle. 2021 is clearly the “first year of the Metaverse”: Roblox, as the “first Metaverse stock”, was grandly listed, with a market value of over 40 billion US dollars, 10 times that of a year ago. Closely followed by Epic Games, the company that produced <em>Fortnite</em>, which raised 1 billion US dollars to develop its Metaverse business. Then Facebook changed its name to “Meta” and announced that it would transform into a Metaverse company within five years. In China, MetaApp, which is quite similar to Roblox, has also completed a C round of financing of up to 100 million US dollars, known as “the largest single financing for the Metaverse in China”. In addition, Nvidia, Tencent, ByteDance… from abroad to China, various giants have announced their Metaverse strategies. The Metaverse has become a battleground.</p>
<h2 id="So-Where-Did-the-Metaverse-Come-From"><a href="#So-Where-Did-the-Metaverse-Come-From" class="headerlink" title="So Where Did the Metaverse Come From?"></a>So Where Did the Metaverse Come From?</h2><p>The Metaverse is not a new concept. In 1992, the famous American science fiction master Neal Stephenson described the Metaverse in his novel <em>Snow Crash</em>: “Put on headphones and goggles, find a connection terminal, and you can enter a virtual space simulated by a computer, parallel to the real world, in the form of a virtual avatar.”</p>
<p>In the book, Neal Stephenson describes a network world parallel to the real world, which is named “Metaverse” in the original English. It consists of two roots, Meta and Verse. Meta means “beyond” and verse means “universe”.</p>
<p>That’s right, Metaverse is the protagonist of our article today - the Metaverse.</p>
<p>People who often play games may scoff at this concept: “Virtual worlds, we have them all in our games.” Is the Metaverse a larger, more participatory MMORPG, a better-looking, more immersive VR world?</p>
<h2 id="So-is-the-Metaverse-that-Everyone-is-Talking-About-Now-Just-a-Virtual-World-in-a-Game"><a href="#So-is-the-Metaverse-that-Everyone-is-Talking-About-Now-Just-a-Virtual-World-in-a-Game" class="headerlink" title="So, is the Metaverse that Everyone is Talking About Now Just a Virtual World in a Game?"></a>So, is the Metaverse that Everyone is Talking About Now Just a Virtual World in a Game?</h2><p>Not really, or rather, not just.</p>
<p>In fact, Metaverse &#x3D; MMORPG + Open-ended Tasks + Editable World + XR Entrance + AI Content Generation + Economic System + Social System + Avatar System + Decentralized Authentication System + Real-world Elements…</p>
<p>Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki proposed that the Metaverse should at least include the following eight elements: Identity, Friends, Immersive, Low Friction, Variety, Anywhere, Economy, and Civility.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> You can have a virtual identity, regardless of your real-world identity. You can be the president or a beggar.</li>
<li><strong>Friends:</strong> You can have real or AI friends, you can socialize, whether you know them in reality or not.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive:</strong> You can be immersed in the experience of the Metaverse and ignore everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Low Friction:</strong> Everything in the Metaverse happens synchronously, without asynchrony or latency, and the experience is perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Variety:</strong> The Metaverse can provide rich and diverse content, including gameplay, props, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Anywhere:</strong> You can log in to the Metaverse anytime, anywhere, without space restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Economy:</strong> Like any complex large-scale game, the Metaverse should have its own economic system.</li>
<li><strong>Civility:</strong> People gather together to create a unique virtual civilization, a digital civilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing this to games, we will find that even the most advanced computer games today cannot fully meet the requirements of the Metaverse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity and Friends:</strong> Games can satisfy these two aspects. Players can create the characters they want, complete interactions with other players, and form social relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive, Low Latency:</strong> With current technology, it can barely be satisfied, but it is still far from the perfect experience (16K+ 720° high-definition images, 180Hz+ refresh rate, latency below 5ms).</li>
<li><strong>Variety:</strong> A large number of content creators are needed to join and produce content, to make elements in the Metaverse, including gameplay, props, characters, scenes, etc., which we call UGC (User Generated Content). At present, it is still far away.</li>
<li><strong>Anywhere:</strong> Depends on digital infrastructure and access methods. Cheap and easy-to-use access terminals can facilitate users to access the Metaverse anytime, anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Economy:</strong> Current games basically have economic systems, but they are very rudimentary. However, NFT (Non-Fungible Token) based on blockchain technology, due to its unique, non-replicable, and indivisible characteristics, can be used to record the production and transaction process of an item, thus providing a good authentication tool for property rights in the virtual world.</li>
<li><strong>Civility:</strong> Currently, games can only be said to have formed a culture, and are far from forming a civilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the Metaverse must not be a virtual world provided by a certain game. Games can at most attract many people, but it is difficult to attract most people in society. It can only become a social phenomenon, not a universe parallel to society.</p>
<h2 id="Since-the-Metaverse-is-Not-a-Game-What-is-it"><a href="#Since-the-Metaverse-is-Not-a-Game-What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Since the Metaverse is Not a Game, What is it?"></a>Since the Metaverse is Not a Game, What is it?</h2><p>Here, two practical schools holding different views of the Metaverse emerge.</p>
<p>One is the company represented by Roblox, which is committed to developing the Metaverse itself. Roblox, as the first company in the world to write the concept of the Metaverse into its IPO prospectus, is called the “first stock of the Metaverse”. This online creative game, played by more than half of the children in the United States, currently has nearly 200 million monthly active users. It allows users to use the platform’s tools to create 3D games or non-game experiences, and has the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports multiplayer online play, with a maximum of 100 people in a room, supporting social interaction.</li>
<li>The player’s image and decorations in Roblox can be used in different games on the platform and are interoperable.</li>
<li>The platform allows creators who upload games to earn the platform’s tokens, Robux.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="So-is-the-Metaverse-a-Platform-About-Games"><a href="#So-is-the-Metaverse-a-Platform-About-Games" class="headerlink" title="So is the Metaverse a Platform About Games?"></a>So is the Metaverse a Platform About Games?</h2><p>This is far from enough.</p>
<p>The Metaverse needs to attract users of all ages around the world, and also make users trust it enough, recognize that everything in it is valuable, and be willing to invest a lot of time and money in it, even work and life. It has the following three characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Able-to-Exist-Forever"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Able-to-Exist-Forever" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Able to Exist Forever"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Able to Exist Forever</h3><p>As long as civilization is not extinguished, the Metaverse will always exist. Just like the real world, users in the Metaverse can change, gameplay can change, and rules can also be adjusted, but the only thing that remains unchanged is that the world itself always exists. It is absolutely impossible for the bankruptcy of a certain company to affect the survival of the Metaverse. This is like the Internet upgrading from the internal network of American scientific research units, ARPANET, to the current Internet.</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Decentralized"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Decentralized" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Decentralized"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Decentralized</h3><p>Just as we cannot judge which country is the center of the earth, a qualified Metaverse can have hot areas, and it can also have poverty and wealth, but it must not have only one center. If the right to interpret the rules of the Metaverse world can only belong to a certain company or a certain country, this is intolerable. To achieve this, there must be an open source shared protocol for accessing the Metaverse, similar to the HTTP protocol of the Internet.</p>
<h3 id="The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Connected-to-Reality"><a href="#The-Metaverse-Must-Be-Connected-to-Reality" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse Must Be Connected to Reality"></a>The Metaverse Must Be Connected to Reality</h3><p>The economic system in the Metaverse must be directly linked to the economic system of the real world. The influence generated by people’s identities in the Metaverse must be real, not illusory.</p>
<p>So let’s look at another point of view, companies led by Facebook and Microsoft that are preparing to provide services for the Metaverse in the future.</p>
<p>On October 29 this year, Zuckerberg described his vision for the Metaverse at Facebook’s Connect developer conference. Zuckerberg said: “I don’t think every company is building its own Metaverse, but all companies are building a part of the entire Metaverse, such as social platforms, tools for creators, e-commerce tools, and so on. The Metaverse is like the current Internet. No one says they are building their own Internet. We would say that we are producing experiences or infrastructure for the Internet. Here, the next generation of the Internet, this broader ecosystem, is called the Metaverse.”</p>
<p>To achieve such a Metaverse, Zuckerberg also mentioned two important characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="Interoperability"><a href="#Interoperability" class="headerlink" title="Interoperability"></a>Interoperability</h3><p>This not only requires that the user’s virtual assets and image in the Metaverse can be used in any experience, but also requires that the Metaverse and the real world have interoperability. For example, using AR to see virtual things in reality, or using VR to buy real goods in a virtual store.</p>
<h3 id="Portability"><a href="#Portability" class="headerlink" title="Portability"></a>Portability</h3><p>In addition to the computers, mobile phones, tablets, watches, etc. that we now use to access the Internet, there should also be portable VR&#x2F;AR glasses in the future, which can allow us to enter a highly immersive virtual world more quickly. The interaction operation should be more intuitive than the current sliding screen, which requires technologies such as eye movement detection and gesture operation.</p>
<p>The idea that the Metaverse is the next generation of the mobile Internet seems to make the concept of the Metaverse less unrealistic.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Exactly-is-the-Metaverse"><a href="#So-What-Exactly-is-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="So, What Exactly is the Metaverse?"></a>So, What Exactly is the Metaverse?</h2><p>The Metaverse does not yet have an authoritative definition, and different participants are constantly enriching its meaning in their own ways. Venture capitalist Matthew Ball defines the Metaverse he understands as follows:</p>
<p>“The Metaverse is a vast network of multiple real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that collaborate and interoperate with each other. This network can allow an almost unlimited number of users to experience simultaneously and continuously, and can provide independent presence and data continuity. These data include identity, history, rights, objects, communication, and payment.”</p>
<p>This definition means that the most likely form of the Metaverse should be like the changes brought about by the mobile Internet. It is not to drag us directly from reality and turn us into Internet addicts. It is more like an extension of users’ needs in communication, entertainment, consumption, production, etc. in real life.</p>
<h2 id="So-How-Far-Are-We-From-the-Metaverse-Now"><a href="#So-How-Far-Are-We-From-the-Metaverse-Now" class="headerlink" title="So, How Far Are We From the Metaverse Now?"></a>So, How Far Are We From the Metaverse Now?</h2><p>Let’s see what the giants are doing: :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is making its own 3D collaborative creation platform.</li>
<li>Omniverse wants to make an operating system for the Metaverse.</li>

<h3 id="NetEase-Side"><a href="#NetEase-Side" class="headerlink" title="NetEase Side:"></a>NetEase Side:</h3><p>At the third quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2021, Ding Lei answered questions about the Metaverse layout and said: “We may be the fastest to run when the gun fires.”</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of NetEase’s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call:</p>
<p>Nomura Securities analyst Jialong Shi: A question about the concept of the Metaverse. Recently, many domestic and foreign companies, including game companies, have expressed their intention to invest in this field, so I would like to ask the management how they view the future growth opportunities brought by the Metaverse to the game industry? Can you reveal NetEase’s layout plan in the Metaverse?</p>
<p>Ding Lei: The Metaverse is indeed a very popular concept, but frankly speaking, no one has touched the Metaverse yet. One thing I can say with certainty is that NetEase is ready at all levels of technology and planning. We know how to do rule design and technology reserves, so you don’t have to worry. When the Metaverse comes, we won’t be unprepared. We may be the fastest to run when the gun fires. I can only answer this way.</p>
<p>It seems that the giants are indeed investing in or promoting the underlying technology research required by the Metaverse.</p>
<h2 id="While-We-Have-Unlimited-Expectations-and-Aspirations-for-the-Metaverse-We-Still-Need-to-Remain-Rational"><a href="#While-We-Have-Unlimited-Expectations-and-Aspirations-for-the-Metaverse-We-Still-Need-to-Remain-Rational" class="headerlink" title="While We Have Unlimited Expectations and Aspirations for the Metaverse, We Still Need to Remain Rational."></a>While We Have Unlimited Expectations and Aspirations for the Metaverse, We Still Need to Remain Rational.</h2><p>Any new technology mostly follows the Gartner Hype Cycle. The Metaverse’s development will not be done overnight.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Does-the-Metaverse-Have-to-Do-with-Me"><a href="#So-What-Does-the-Metaverse-Have-to-Do-with-Me" class="headerlink" title="So, What Does the Metaverse Have to Do with Me?"></a>So, What Does the Metaverse Have to Do with Me?</h2><p>The concept of the Metaverse seems illusory, but in fact it has gradually begun to penetrate our lives. The formation of the Metaverse will enable the coexistence of virtual life and real life, two universes, and people’s lifestyles in the Metaverse may be completely different from those in real life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture:</strong> During the epidemic last year, UCB University of California, Berkeley held a graduation ceremony in Minecraft. The scenes and elements built in the game were almost identical to those in real UCB. The character images of various graduate representatives participated in the game at the same time to hold the ceremony. To a certain extent, it has brought a unique presentation to the cause of education and culture.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, players can freely design their own islands, presenting the concept of UGC in the Metaverse. Before the US presidential election, when the epidemic was at its peak, the Biden team used the Animal Crossing platform to create Biden Island to canvass for himself. To a certain extent, it allows players to establish intersections with Mr. President in the virtual world, and connects people who may never meet in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping:</strong> <em>Boson Protocol</em>, as an infrastructure project for blockchain protocols, recently purchased a piece of land on the virtual reality platform Decentraland for $704,000, aiming to build a shopping mall for global brands on this land. It connects one end to Decentraland and the other end to various retail stores in the real world, establishing a connection between the Metaverse and the real world. In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, there are senior players in the game who have created Nookazon - the Animal Crossing version of Amazon, which is convenient for players to buy and sell items in the game. Various highly free gameplay and heavy social attributes have all promoted the development of the Metaverse ecology.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> At the end of last year, Rap singer Lil Nas X held a concert on Roblox, and this year singer Travis Scott also held a solo concert on Fortnite, attracting the online attention of 44 million users. Nas used this sentence to describe his experience: “I can have my fans running around in space, while I’m flying in a spaceship.”</li>
<li><strong>Games:</strong> As the current battleground for capital and technology, playability is the winning factor. Looking at the current game industry, some games have initially played a part of the concept of the Metaverse, just like Animal Crossing with creative content and social attributes. As for Zelda, because his game territory is quite large, it has built an open world component to a certain extent. Like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft, as professional game development teams, their playability provided by the game is also recognized by the industry, and it also provides impetus for the sustainable development of the game. There are also blockchain games Decentraland, Sandbox, Alice, etc. These games are all moving towards the decentralized infinite game - the Metaverse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Metaverse-is-an-Extension-of-User-Needs-Not-an-Escape-from-the-Real-World"><a href="#The-Metaverse-is-an-Extension-of-User-Needs-Not-an-Escape-from-the-Real-World" class="headerlink" title="The Metaverse is an Extension of User Needs, Not an Escape from the Real World"></a>The Metaverse is an Extension of User Needs, Not an Escape from the Real World</h2><p>The outbreak of the new crown epidemic in the past two years has accelerated the virtualization of society, making people’s online life a normal state from a short-term exception, a parallel world from a supplement to the real world, and making people realize that the virtual is not false, let alone insignificant. 2020 has clearly become the tipping point for the virtualization of human society. In the future Metaverse, people will change a mode to work, live, and entertain. It will give birth to new 3D user-generated content, which is more attractive than short videos; there will be new ways of socializing, which are more convenient and easy to use than instant messaging software; of course, it will also create more difficult life troubles and political problems… Human real life will migrate to the virtual world on a large scale, and human beings will become amphibious species of reality and numbers. Russian President Putin believes that: “The possibilities brought by the ‘Metaverse’ should be used to break through the limitations of distance, help communication and learning, rather than an escape from the real world.”</p>
<p>The experience felt in the Metaverse, whether physical or digital - is real. In a virtual place we may be more real, we may be more comfortable or more creative than in the real world, this is the power of the parallel virtual experience. Just like the classic line in the movie <em>Ready Player One</em>:</p>
<p>“This is the Oasis, a whole virtual universe. The only limit here is your own imagination.”</p>

    <title>Why is the Translation of &#39;Elden Ring&#39; So Controversial: The Importance of a Bridge Language</title>
    <url>/2022/05/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20220607_28584_1022808/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220607/28584_1022808.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2022 can be said to be a year of great games. Among them, <em>Elden Ring</em>, produced by FromSoftware, the developer of the Souls series, at the end of February this year, made many Tarnished revel. The Souls-like gameplay that makes people love and hate it, the rich weapon combat system, the fragmented narrative, the huge Western fantasy open world, and the shocking story worldview have swept the major game review websites and is arguably the ceiling of current open-world games.</p>
<p>So, for such a 3A masterpiece with a huge worldview and complex game mechanics, what is the localization like? Why is the translation so controversial and criticized by players? This article will take you on a journey through Elden Ring from a game localization perspective, through case analysis.</p>
<h2 id="1-“The-Chinese-Translation-is-a-Bit-Strange”-Katakana-Hell"><a href="#1-“The-Chinese-Translation-is-a-Bit-Strange”-Katakana-Hell" class="headerlink" title="1. “The Chinese Translation is a Bit Strange” - Katakana Hell"></a>1. “The Chinese Translation is a Bit Strange” - Katakana Hell</h2><p>Elden Ring has the grandest story background in the history of Souls games, thanks to the amazing imagination and creative skills of George R.R. Martin, the author of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. Martin built a magical world full of human entanglements, anxiety, and turmoil for this game. However, it is precisely this <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> style story framework that has brought huge challenges to the localization of the game, especially since the developer of the game is from Japan. In Japanese translation, if you encounter words that you don’t know how to translate, Japanese will use katakana for direct transliteration. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, we often see such a shadow. Although this form of translation is correct and does save a lot of trouble, can it really give players a good experience?</p>
<h3 id="Case-1-“Limgrave”-in-the-Novice-Village-is-Actually-a-Cemetery"><a href="#Case-1-“Limgrave”-in-the-Novice-Village-is-Actually-a-Cemetery" class="headerlink" title="Case 1: “Limgrave” in the Novice Village is Actually a Cemetery"></a>Case 1: “Limgrave” in the Novice Village is Actually a Cemetery</h3><p>Limgrave is the name of the first area where you are born, that is, the novice village. Just looking at the Chinese name, it is not difficult to imagine that it is a transliteration.</p>
<p>In fact, the English version of Limgrave is called “Limgrave”, and the Japanese version is “リムグレイブ”.</p>
<p>Grave, corresponding to the Japanese グレイブ, means graveyard&#x2F;cemetery. Then the preceding Lim- is a homophone often used in Western writing to write names and place names. So what does Lim- refer to? There are two theories.</p>
<p>The first is that the boss of the Limgrave area is called “Godrick the Grafted”. His ability is to graft the limbs of others onto himself, so it can be associated that the Lim- here refers to Limb, meaning limb&#x2F;extremity. So Limgrave means limb grave, the graveyard of limbs.</p>
<p>Another theory is this. The Lim here is a katakana transliteration of the Japanese “リム”, which actually refers to Rim. And Rim means border, edge, boundary, derived from the Old English rima. Then Limgrave means Rimgrave, border graveyard. It just so happens that the name of a dungeon next to the birthplace in the game is called the “Fringefolk Hero’s Grave”.</p>
<p>Which theory do you agree with? However, no matter which theory is correct, Limgrave is not a good place, it refers to the meaning of a cemetery, but players who have just come out of the novice village can’t see this meaning at all.</p>
<h3 id="Case-2-What-Kind-of-Castle-is-Stormveil-Castle"><a href="#Case-2-What-Kind-of-Castle-is-Stormveil-Castle" class="headerlink" title="Case 2: What Kind of Castle is Stormveil Castle?"></a>Case 2: What Kind of Castle is Stormveil Castle?</h3><p>Let’s take a look at “Stormveil”, which has been criticized by players countless times.</p>
<p>I believe that many friends with good English will think of “Stonewell” or “Stonewall” when they see this name.</p>
<p>But in fact, “Stormveil” in the English text is “Stormveil”, which is surprising. Although this name is very “Ice and Fire”, the sudden transliteration is really puzzling against the backdrop of names such as “Storm’s End” and “Stormhill”.</p>
<p>The preceding Storm means storm.</p>
<p>But what about Veil? Veil means veil in English, which means to cover up. If you have to translate it, Stormveil Castle can be translated into Stormveil Castle. Huh? Isn’t it strange?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the Japanese text - “ストームヴィル城”. The katakana of the first half of the Japanese “ストーム” is Storm, but does the remaining “ヴィル” mean Veil?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Here we checked the translation and found that “ヴィル” actually means Ville, which refers to city, urban area, town, and is a French word;</p>
<p>The katakana corresponding to Veil is “ベール”, which is different from the original Japanese.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone should also understand that “Stormveil” is actually Stormville, meaning storm city.</p>
<p>The “Stormveil” here should be a direct katakana transliteration of Japanese. If you translate the English Stormveil, then the Chinese should also be Stormveil Castle, which is obviously not the case here. However, no matter which language is used as the bridge language for translation, “Stormveil” has lost the original prestige of Stormville.</p>
<h2 id="2-Is-the-Original-Text-in-the-Game-English-or-Japanese"><a href="#2-Is-the-Original-Text-in-the-Game-English-or-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="2. Is the Original Text in the Game English or Japanese?"></a>2. Is the Original Text in the Game English or Japanese?</h2><p>According to the analysis of the above cases, we can determine that the Chinese was translated from Japanese as the bridge language, so it also fell into katakana hell. But is the source language of the game English or Japanese?</p>
<p>Although the official introduction mentioned that George R.R. Martin contributed a huge background worldview setting to <em>Elden Ring</em>, Martin mainly participated in the outline of the game legend, and the story after the player starts the game is still handled by FromSoftware’s local Japanese team.</p>
<p>Then we speculate that English is just the language used by George R.R. Martin during the creation period of the game development. Due to the background of most Japanese members of the production team, the style of most of the text in the game will be closer to the habits of Japanese culture, so it is possible that Japanese is the real source language of the game. The story framework created by George R.R. Martin in English directly transliterates untranslatable words into katakana during the translation into Japanese, and then uses Japanese as the bridge language to start localization in various languages. And some of the English we see in the game is also translated from Japanese. Stormveil Castle is an example, let alone Chinese.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion-The-Choice-of-Localization-Bridge-Language"><a href="#3-Conclusion-The-Choice-of-Localization-Bridge-Language" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion: The Choice of Localization Bridge Language"></a>3. Conclusion: The Choice of Localization Bridge Language</h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em> successfully creates a magnificent open world without losing the Souls flavor at all. Its scale is amazing, and the length of the story is also admirable. The story created by George R.R. Martin is imaginative and intoxicating.</p>
<p>But in terms of localization, the worldview of <em>Elden Ring</em> conveys a Western fantasy style. If the background of the creative language is respected, and English is used as the source language instead of Japanese, which is mainly Oriental, will the quality of Chinese localization be improved?</p>
<p>From the perspective of most current game studios and publishers, English is still preferred as the bridge language for localization. The most important reason is that based on the global universality of English, using English as the bridge language can find more experienced game translators.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the developer FromSoftware, the scale of the development team is not very large. If Japanese is used as the source language of the game for localized development, it can save a lot of development time and cost. Moreover, various translation errors that also appear in previous Souls games can also be seen. It can be seen that the developer’s priority for localization quality is not so high, and it also exposes that FromSoftware has always had some localization problems.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what language is used as the bridge language, the most important thing is to accurately convey the meaning that the game itself wants to express through different languages. Before localization, you should first understand the meaning of the original text, and the translation should be understandable, and the meaning should be conveyed correctly. This is the most important thing, rather than falling into “katakana hell”.</p>
<h3 id="Easter-Egg-Why-is-Elden-Ring-Called-“Old-Man’s-Ring”-in-Chinese"><a href="#Easter-Egg-Why-is-Elden-Ring-Called-“Old-Man’s-Ring”-in-Chinese" class="headerlink" title="Easter Egg: Why is Elden Ring Called “Old Man’s Ring” in Chinese?"></a>Easter Egg: Why is Elden Ring Called “Old Man’s Ring” in Chinese?</h3><p>Elden is very similar to Elder in English, and the meaning of Elder includes “elder”. Another very famous game, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, is nicknamed Old Scroll because of its English name “The elder scrolls”, so there is a similar nickname here in Elden Ring. The meaning of the word Ring is ring or ring. The producer of the game has explained that the ring in the game name does not mean ring, but refers to a circle. Therefore, the combination of the two has the alias of “Old Man’s Ring”.</p>

    <title>Players are Wildly Sharing this Word Puzzle Game, What Did it Do Right?</title>

<p>Earlier this year, <em>Wordle</em> sparked a puzzle craze on overseas social media. Those familiar with it should not be strangers to the screen-filling pictures composed of green, yellow, and gray squares. Even now, if you type “Wordle” into a search engine, a Google dynamic icon in Wordle’s classic gray, yellow, and green color scheme will appear, which shows how popular <em>Wordle</em> is. However, this sharing that looks like Morse code, and playing it is like an educational English learning word puzzle game, why did it become popular, making overseas players enjoy it and check in every day?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Wordle-How-to-play"><a href="#1-What-is-Wordle-How-to-play" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Wordle? How to play?"></a>1. What is Wordle? How to play?</h2><p>To put it bluntly, <em>Wordle</em> is a crossword puzzle game that is updated daily. The player’s only goal each day is to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The entire game interface is simple and intuitive, consisting of a 5×6 square array; the game rules are also relatively simple. After the player enters the guess, the game will mark each letter square with a color to indicate the accuracy of the current guess:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gray:</strong> Indicates that the letter is not in the answer at all.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Indicates that the letter is in the answer, but at the wrong position.</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Indicates that the letter is in the answer and at the correct position.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players continue to try based on the hints obtained from each guess, narrowing down the scope of the answer until they guess the answer correctly or use up all six attempts. After the game, players will be provided with a statistical data, showing the accuracy rate of each step, the number of consecutive days of playing, and the countdown to the next round; at the same time, the player’s game interface will be generated into a corresponding color layout of the emoji square matrix, and the player can click the “share” button to copy and share to various social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-is-Wordle-Popular"><a href="#2-Why-is-Wordle-Popular" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is Wordle Popular?"></a>2. Why is Wordle Popular?</h2><p>Many readers may be thinking after seeing the above introduction: “Isn’t this just a traditional crossword puzzle game? How did it become popular?” “These rules are also old-fashioned, isn’t the number guessing game in <em>Xuan-Yuan Sword: Scar of Sky</em> exactly the same as this <em>Wordle</em>?”</p>
<p>So, the gameplay is not new, and the core is more like education than entertainment, why is it popular? Why are players willing to participate in the game every day and actively share it on social media?</p>
<p><em>Wordle</em> actually has a “story”. The game was born out of a love story. The game’s creator, Josh Wardle, is a software engineer. His girlfriend loves to play crossword puzzles. Wardle developed this game for his girlfriend. It is said that “Wordle” is a pun combining his last name and the game theme “Word”. In 2021, Wardle accidentally sent the game to a family group chat. The game was unexpectedly popular, making Wardle feel the game’s potential for dissemination, and only then did he share the game online at the end of the year. As of January this year, the number of players challenging Wordle every day has reached 2 million.</p>
<p>If you carefully examine the core setting of <em>Wordle</em>, it is not difficult to find that it represents a classic paradigm for the success of casual games: simple rules, easy gameplay, with many attributes that promote dissemination, and can spread to all social media that people can access. Not only that, compared with almost all casual games now thinking about how to make users stay longer, how to actively or passively share socially, Wordle does the opposite, using the setting of providing the same question to all players every day + a simple, intuitive and special sharing method, explaining what “less is more” means.</p>
<p>First of all, <em>Wordle</em> only updates one question a day. In fact, word puzzles, or casual games in general, are not considered to have high replayability, and this artificially created scarcity enhances the player’s desire to challenge and their anticipation, like “hunger marketing”, making players who successfully challenge feel satisfied, and making players who fail to challenge feel concerned. If several hundred levels are set up like in ordinary casual games, players may easily feel bored due to a large amount of homogeneous content in a short period of time. However, the setting of one question per day makes the content fresh for players every day, and it only takes three to five minutes to complete a round, making it easier to form a daily check-in habit. In addition, this setting also makes the game inherently topical, making it easy to expand the game’s voice through word of mouth. Many tweets with #dailyWordleClub on Twitter also prove this point. According to Twitter’s data statistics, in January this year alone, there were 1.3 million tweets related to <em>Wordle</em> in the UK, and the amount of chat interaction increased by 16 times.</p>
<p>Secondly, all players share a puzzle every day. Doing the same question as everyone else obviously amplifies the player’s sense of accomplishment on social platforms. Many people will compare with family and friends, “I guessed it in 3 tries, you used 4 tries or didn’t guess it, I’m better than you, at least luckier than you”. This sense of accomplishment of “what others don’t have, I have, and what others have, I have better” is greater than the sense of accomplishment of simply guessing the answer, and the player’s satisfaction can last longer.</p>
<p>Then there is <em>Wordle</em>‘s sharing function, which is relatively cleverly designed: using color blocks to refer to the game results. Due to the different problem-solving processes, each player can get a completely different three-color picture for sharing. This cryptic sharing is highly recognizable, easy to arouse the curiosity of uninitiated players, and can also allow players to communicate game progress and share “answering experience” with each other while avoiding spoilers. Moreover, the shared picture can also show how many times the player used to guess the answer today. Coupled with the rule of one word per day, players will feel a trace of invisible competition in sharing, and secretly compete in terms of IQ or luck.</p>
<p>This relatively unique way of sharing has been creatively diversified by players. From sharing solutions, to different art-styles (like Pixel Art), and other creative outlets (like Drawing, or Embroidery).</p>
<h2 id="3-Can-a-Chinese-Version-of-Wordle-be-Successful"><a href="#3-Can-a-Chinese-Version-of-Wordle-be-Successful" class="headerlink" title="3. Can a Chinese Version of Wordle be Successful?"></a>3. Can a Chinese Version of Wordle be Successful?</h2><p>Later, as <em>Wordle</em> spread to the Chinese community, some people began to discuss the possibility of a Chinese version of <em>Wordle</em>. The one that stands out is <em>Handou</em>, which is in the form of “guessing idioms”. Players first guess the tone order of the four-character idiom, and then guess the first letter of the pinyin after guessing correctly. In addition, some people have proposed that strokes, Cangjie pinyin, etc. can be used as guessing targets.</p>
<p>Although a Chinese replica version has appeared, due to the significant differences between English and Chinese characters, the difficulty of <em>Handou</em> has increased invisibly. English words are only composed of 26 English letters, so the correctness of inputting letters has become the only criterion for <em>Wordle</em>. The composition of Chinese characters is particularly complex, which can be spelled out by pinyin or composed of radicals. Therefore, even if radicals are used as additional hints, the difficulty of the game is significantly increased, making some players choose to stay away.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a derivative of <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Handou</em> has become a Chinese version of it. Although there are slight differences in rules, there is no substantial innovation in game content and gameplay. This makes it difficult for Chinese users who have experienced <em>Wordle</em> to maintain continuous attention to <em>Handou</em>. In addition, there are also Sweardle, Lewdle, Nerdle, and Globle, which are derivatives of <em>Wordle</em>. The increase of these “same old thing” homogenous games makes it more difficult for <em>Handou</em> to stand out.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Wordle</em> itself, the game was a smash hit, but it is now slowly disappearing from the public eye, which seems to be the inevitable fate of casual H5 games. The reason is that the single game mode is a pain point that they cannot solve. For most players, the freshness when they first come into contact will gradually decrease over time, until they finally choose to quit. But we cannot deny the initial success of the game. <em>Wordle</em> allows players to feel the original intention of the game: shareability, pleasantness, and competitiveness. This is what players want to see, and it is also what game developers and operators should think about and insist on.</p>

    <title>What Do Players of &quot;Buy-to-Play Otome Games&quot; Really Like?</title>
    <url>/2022/05/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20220607_28584_1022838/</url>

<p>Unlike other action-oriented buy-to-play games that pursue a sense of excitement, most buy-to-play otome mobile games are in AVG (Adventure Game) format, and some game systems have even been simplified to “audiobooks.” It seems more accurate to describe the gaming experience as “reading an e-book” rather than “playing a game.” However, even though the system has been simplified to an e-book, and the golden age of around 2011 has passed, buy-to-play otome games still have stable sales both domestically and internationally. Some people will definitely ask: “Why do these players spend 600 yuan to buy a game that lacks a sense of game operation and is similar to an e-book mode?” This article will analyze the purchasing factors of buy-to-play otome game players.</p>
<h2 id="1-Exquisite-Art-Style"><a href="#1-Exquisite-Art-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Exquisite Art Style"></a>1. Exquisite Art Style</h2><p>Compared with other games, standalone otome games often have higher-quality character art, with a delicate and exquisite style. Buy-to-play players often pay attention to the NPC characters in the game from head to toe, from outerwear to accessories. Whether it is Western fantasy, steampunk, or historical drama, popular otome games often have handsome character designs and excellent artwork. Buy-to-play games often create a complete game world for players, where each character will satisfy the aesthetic fantasies of general women, representing the highest aesthetic level of players. In addition, many players also have their own requirements for the exquisiteness of the game UI: the color scheme should be tasteful, and the font should be beautiful and easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>Many game companies are also aware of this demand from players and have put a lot of effort into the iterative update of art style. Many large game manufacturers have even cultivated special artists for buy-to-play otome games. Looking at the current buy-to-play otome games, we can feel that the characters tend to be beautiful, from hair design to clothing matching, all have been carefully designed; not only that, the UI design also incorporates the color elements that female players like, and incorporates the game elements that female players like.</p>

<h2 id="2-Luxurious-Voice-Actors"><a href="#2-Luxurious-Voice-Actors" class="headerlink" title="2. Luxurious Voice Actors"></a>2. Luxurious Voice Actors</h2><p>In addition to exquisite graphics, another feature of the standard configuration of buy-to-play otome games is the full voice-over system. In the absence of gameplay, the voice acting of voice actors is one of the players’ gaming experience points, so the current voice acting market for buy-to-play otome games is also becoming increasingly competitive. Players require that the voice should fit the character itself, and they also require that this voice actor needs to have a certain popularity and have certain achievements in the industry.</p>
<p>Unlike many luxurious voice actors in China, whose voices tend to be uniformly “seductive,” Japanese male voice actors often tend to have more diverse voice acting styles due to their large number and the great differences in players’ preferences. Whether it is a refreshing boy, a mysterious person who is both righteous and evil, or a noble royal family, you will always find well-known voice actors who fit the character setting to cooperate. In the game, a fitting voice can bring players a more immersive enjoyment.</p>

Character Designs That Match Their Own Aesthetics"></a>3. Character Designs That Match Their Own Aesthetics</h2><p>The number of capturable characters in a buy-to-play single-price otome game is not very large, generally maintaining a level of around 6. However, the personalities of the characters are often individual and distinct. For example, a game will never have two presidents, nor will it have two characters with hidden darkness. Attributes such as sharp-tongued, tsundere, and natural will often appear reasonably and be integrated into a game. Players will always find their favorite object in the game. Many game manufacturers even release FD sequels in works other than the main story. In FD, they will add capturable game objects to attract fans of the character designs of Subs (non-capturable NPCs) in the main story to purchase and experience the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F8e97deb2-ea50-4043-aba6-2fa930691493.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;8e97deb2-ea50-4043-aba6-2fa930691493.jpg"></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="4-Powerful-Script"><a href="#4-Powerful-Script" class="headerlink" title="4. Powerful Script"></a>4. Powerful Script</h2><p>The script is half the battle of a buy-to-play otome game. With the assistance of voice acting and art, the scriptwriter needs to show players a unique worldview. Buy-to-play otome games often have a huge amount of text, often requiring players to spend 50 hours to complete the game. Many otome games will hire professional light novel writers or professional writers to create the script, and the game will have different manifestations due to the personal style of the scriptwriter. Buy-to-play standalone games include not only relatively close-to-life script frameworks such as “Stardom 2” and “Tokimeki Memorial Girl’s Side,” but also script worlds with bizarre plots such as Hyakki Yagyō (Night Parade of One Hundred Demons), vampire families, or Snow White dark fairy tales. Whether you are a fan of realism or a fan of fairy tales and legends, you can experience the fun of the game in buy-to-play otome games.</p>
<p>It is precisely because buy-to-play otome games are infinitely close to the e-book mode that the script will largely determine the player’s experience. If a game’s script has flaws, such as unclear logic or an anticlimactic ending, then players will rate the work lower. On the contrary, among a group of beautiful men and women, games with strong and reasonable scripts often become classics and white moonlight in the hearts of players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fdea1878a-b35d-404d-84fa-0d772ba3a678.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;dea1878a-b35d-404d-84fa-0d772ba3a678.png"></p>

Communication with Like-Minded People</h2><p>Around 2010, the main forum for female-oriented games, <a href="https://www.yumemori.com/index.php">Yume100</a>, had a large number of female-oriented game enthusiasts. The forum had very advanced and detailed classifications: otome games&#x2F;yuri games&#x2F;BL, all ages&#x2F;non-all ages were reasonably divided; in addition to game resources, the forum also had players’ clearance thoughts, drama resources, and the latest event information. It can be said that, with a membership to [Yume100], you could get the most advanced information on Japanese female-oriented games. Because the website’s server is small and has high requirements for capacity, registering as a member of [Yume100] requires layers of review, and being rejected is also commonplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fb5e3b6c7-61fb-4f2f-aaba-00019142eab9.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;b5e3b6c7-61fb-4f2f-aaba-00019142eab9.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In the Q&amp;A of Zhihu: “How to evaluate the female-oriented forum Yume100?”, some respondents said that they had been rejected three times in a row.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the high membership threshold, replying to content such as “up” and “thank you” on other forum pages is almost impossible on [Yume100]. In order to reduce the load on the server, over time, the [Yume100] forum has the default rule of “no water posts, replies must be more than XX words.” Therefore, [Yume100] has gathered the most sincere and persistent standalone game players, where they conduct sincere game discussions, and through discussions and exchanges, the most core players are retained.</p>

<p><em>In the Yume100 forum, you can often see members writing small essays to discuss female-oriented game related topics.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the emergence of new social platforms such as Weibo, players of buy-to-play games also moved some of their discussions and social activities to Weibo and communities. On Weibo, you can buy and sell second-hand game cartridges, purchase in groups, or make friends with like-minded people in super topics with tags. In the search list of communities, by searching for specific words such as “otome game” and “standalone game”, you can also find many active groups of hundreds of people.</p>

Smooth Reading Experience Brought by Buy-to-Play</h2><p>Unlike free mobile games, buy-to-play otome games often do not charge players any fees after paying the amount of the game itself. The phenomenon of script reading stalls caused by level-up and level-stuck in mobile games is uncommon in buy-to-play games. Players can reasonably arrange their time and read the plot content they like in one go. Many players often mind the reading stall caused by the bundling of plot and level in mobile games. On the way to wait for the upgrade, players may have forgotten the plot content of the previous chapter, thus interfering with the player’s immersive experience. The smoother reading experience is also the reason why players will choose buy-to-play otome games.</p>

    <title>Exploring Arabic Games: From Market to Development</title>
    <url>/2022/05/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20220607_28584_1022854/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220607/28584_1022854.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, with the domestic game market approaching saturation, a large number of domestic manufacturers have turned their attention to overseas markets. Data from the “China Game Industry Report” shows that the overseas sales of domestic games have shown an upward trend in the past three years, and the growth rate is relatively stable. On the other hand, the goal of domestic games going overseas is no longer limited to the traditional East Asian market and the American market. Data shows that the proportion of the United States, Japan and South Korea in the overseas sales of domestic games has declined in the past three years, replaced by the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and other previously neglected regions.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Current-Situation-of-the-Middle-East-Game-Market"><a href="#1-The-Current-Situation-of-the-Middle-East-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. The Current Situation of the Middle East Game Market"></a>1. The Current Situation of the Middle East Game Market</h2><p>The Middle East, also known as the main Arabic-speaking region. This area has always maintained a mysterious impression in the hearts of most people in China. The strong religious atmosphere and the very different language and characters have made domestic game producers discouraged.</p>
<p>But in fact, the game industry has considerable prospects in the Middle East. Soccer games represented by “FIFA” have good revenue in the Middle East, and the popular e-sports has become a competitive growth point supported by the Saudi government.</p>
<p>In terms of gaming equipment, console games are more mainstream in the Middle East, and PC games are also more common. The mobile game industry has only developed in recent years with the rise of smart phones. Currently, the mobile game market in the Middle East is still in the development stage.</p>
<p>In terms of game types, game players in the Middle East prefer European and American style RPG games, such as “The Witcher”, “Resident Evil” and “Assassin’s Creed” series, all of which have a considerable audience in the Middle East; while MMORPG and JRPG, which are more mature in the East Asian market, have not received good response in the Middle East market. However, this situation may improve with the rise of mobile games. Overall, the game preferences of Middle Eastern players are more similar to those of European and American players, but compared with European and American players, their acceptance of East Asian game culture is lower.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Potential-of-the-Game-Market-in-the-Middle-East"><a href="#2-The-Potential-of-the-Game-Market-in-the-Middle-East" class="headerlink" title="2. The Potential of the Game Market in the Middle East"></a>2. The Potential of the Game Market in the Middle East</h2><p>Overall, the game market in the Middle East is still in a rising period. In this region, nearly half of young people are “digital natives”. They are accustomed to the use of electronic devices and smart software, which also gives them more opportunities to contact and understand various new software, including video games. In foreign video websites such as Youtube, there are many Arabic game review videos with millions of views, which is enough to prove the potential of the entire Arabic-speaking region in the game industry.</p>
<p>Another major factor contributing to the development of the game market in the Middle East is its payment model. In the Middle East, most game players have a relatively high level of education and are more proficient in English, and can directly experience the English version of the game, which also leads to the fact that the users of the entire game market have a strong ability to pay and do not lack the willingness to pay. The result is that the main way of game revenue in the Middle East comes from the high consumption of individual players.</p>
<p>Finally, the game industry and video game industry in the Middle East have also been licensed by the government, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both of which have introduced policies to promote the development of the video game industry in their own countries.</p>
<h2 id="3-Precautions-for-Game-Development-in-the-Middle-East"><a href="#3-Precautions-for-Game-Development-in-the-Middle-East" class="headerlink" title="3. Precautions for Game Development in the Middle East"></a>3. Precautions for Game Development in the Middle East</h2><p>Of course, there are still certain requirements for a game to enter the Middle East market. Compared with other games commonly seen in the domestic market, the design of games in the Middle East needs to consider two aspects: cultural environment and language environment. Only by approaching the usage habits and trend of the Arabic language ecology from two aspects can it be possible to break the cultural barriers and achieve success in the Middle East market.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Factors"><a href="#Cultural-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Factors"></a>Cultural Factors</h3><p>When it comes to cultural factors, the differences in geographical environment are unavoidable: the climate in the Middle East is very dry, and there are basically no large rivers except the Nile. The landform is mainly desert, so there are rarely forest landforms in this area; at the same time, there are no high mountains in the Middle East, which makes the area often windy. In this case, traditional houses in the Middle East are mainly made of stone and are low in shape. At the same time, there are few crops such as rice and tea that require sufficient water in the Middle East. In Arab culture, the most common plant image is the date palm, and the most common animal images are camels and horses.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the more successful mobile game “Revenge of Sultans” in the Middle East, the appearance of the main SLG city has been changed. The traditional palace-shaped main city has been changed to a low shape similar to a mosque, and minarets and other buildings with Arabic characteristics have been added on both sides of the building. In terms of the general environment, “Revenge of Sultans” also adopts standard desert terrain, with vegetation such as date palm trees to show the characteristic features of the Middle East.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F86f9cff2-8485-4eff-ad90-8de5eb6966e5.png/size/" alt="Revenge of Sultans Main City"></p>
<p>Another very important factor in the Middle East is the religious foundation. The entire Arab region and the Arabic language itself have been indelibly influenced by Islam. Religion has penetrated every aspect of Arab life. The crescent pattern has become a major symbol of Arab civilization, and the Islamic god “Allah” has become a unique existence in the Arab mythological system. Islam has only one god, which is reflected in the localization process of the game, that is, the conveyance of the concept of “god”.</p>
<p>In polytheistic mythological systems (such as Greek mythology, Roman mythology, and Japanese mythology), the number of “gods” is more than one, and different gods have their own duties. But in Arabic, there is only one word used to describe “god”, and this word can only be used to refer to Allah. Therefore, games often need to convert “god” to a certain extent during the Arabic localization process. For example, in “God of War 4”, in the game guide video made by Arabs, “God of War” is translated as “سيد الحرب” (meaning Lord of War). This translation is obviously to avoid religious problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F1bc9af09-cd78-46c3-af2d-01b2e8468fe5.png/size/" alt="God of War special translation"></p>
<h3 id="Linguistic-Factors—Arabic-Player-Interface-Reading-Habits"><a href="#Linguistic-Factors—Arabic-Player-Interface-Reading-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Linguistic Factors—Arabic Player Interface Reading Habits"></a>Linguistic Factors—Arabic Player Interface Reading Habits</h3><p>In terms of game design, the right-to-left writing order of Arabic often becomes the first threshold for game UI design. The right-to-left writing brings not only simple changes in text layout, but more changes in reading order. In the Arabic environment, readers are more accustomed to paying attention to the right side of the interface first, and then to the left side of the interface. Therefore, the interface design of Arabic websites is generally developed from right to left.</p>
<p>Take Al Arabiya, a Saudi news website, as an example. It can be seen that the headlines of the Arabic version of the website are placed on the right side of the screen, while the news with relatively low attention is placed on the left side. In addition, the magnifying glass icon of the search function is also opposite to other languages. Even for pop-up windows, the option buttons are arranged on the left side of the entire pop-up window.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F251411e4-4427-4b9a-a628-2d2fed8e613b.png/size/" alt="Al Arabiya Arabic Site"></p>
<p>In contrast, in the English version of the website, the headlines are adjusted to the left side of the screen, and all tabs are arranged in left alignment, including the top function interface, which also adopts a left-to-right layout, which is also the same as the interface layout of most languages that read from left to right.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F45bc2520-d122-4a28-879b-207fb2ad9136.png/size/" alt="Al Arabiya English Site"></p>
<p>In terms of English websites, the Arabic interface of YouTube has also made directional adjustments. Different from other websites, YouTube has also adjusted the direction of the pop-up of the functional interface to maximize the website experience of Arabic users.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F61424ac5-6920-4e91-81ed-971262560c18.png/size/" alt="Youtube Standard"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fe6d97d45-5ea0-47c5-a095-7c354725c4ba.png/size/" alt="Youtube Arabic"></p>
<h3 id="Case-Study-of-Game-Experience-Design-Adapted-to-Arabic"><a href="#Case-Study-of-Game-Experience-Design-Adapted-to-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Case Study of Game Experience Design Adapted to Arabic"></a>Case Study of Game Experience Design Adapted to Arabic</h3><p>In games, many manufacturers have also noticed the special features of Arabic and have taken special measures for the Arabic interface. Of course, these measures are often “compromises” made for this special language in localization to minimize the impact of the characteristics of this language on the overall game experience. In view of the right-to-left reading habit of Arabic, Arabic players tend to pay attention to the right side of the screen first, and then to the left. Therefore, some games designed in English or other left-to-right languages will avoid designing the interface according to the habits of their own language.</p>
<p>In the Arabic interface of “Resident Evil 7”, text prompts such as news reports and diaries are adjusted to right-to-left layout and centered on the screen, which is also the most common way to handle the Arabic interface in games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F33b9f8f4-a53e-4a57-a287-0836e7e3314b.png/size/" alt="Resident Evil 7 Diaries"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F06d8bf93-8a6b-4366-a54f-a1fca4abbf88.png/size/" alt="Resident Evil 7 News"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Resident Evil》 uses right-aligned text format for Arabic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But sometimes, simply adjusting the direction of the text cannot fully make the interface fit the usage habits of Arabs, especially when the text involves Arabic numerals. Although Arabic is written from right to left, numbers are an exception, and they still maintain the order from left to right. For example, in “Horizon Zero Dawn”, the item type number in the backpack interface is handled incorrectly. According to Arabic habits, the number 3 should be placed to the right of the quantifier عناصر.</p>
<p>Also in this game, in the column displaying the number of items, 20&#x2F;20 is placed to the right of the quantifier مورد. This layout design is relatively more in line with Arabic reading habits.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F06109d68-9ece-4b8e-a16c-b0eb727f6698.png/size/" alt="Horizon Arabic"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F7397ead1-17f9-42bb-b194-98200c2ee171.png/size/" alt="Horizon English"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Horizon Zero Dawn》 Arabic backpack interface</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, some games did not consider the particularity of this language when localizing into Arabic, and directly used the previous UI, resulting in the interface not being aesthetically pleasing in Arabic. For example, the dialogue options in “The Witcher 3”, the option text of the English interface and the Arabic interface are left-aligned, causing the Arabic interface to deviate from normal reading habits.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fb5be586b-226a-47d0-a0aa-328369239abc.png/size/" alt="Witcher 3 English"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>The dialogue options in “The Witcher” remain left-aligned, making the Arabic UI look unaesthetic</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Overall, the Arab game market, represented by the Middle East, is still in the initial and rising stage, with greater potential to be tapped; but in view of the particularity of the Arabic language itself and the cultural particularity of the Middle East, domestic game products still need to make certain adjustments in content when trying to enter the Arab market, so as to facilitate the promotion of products in the Arab region, especially in UI design, it is necessary to consider the right-to-left writing characteristics of Arabic.</p>

    <title>Where Did All the Mothers in Video Games Go?</title>
    <url>/2022/05/08/netease-ux-articles/news_20220607_28584_1022869/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220607/28584_1022869.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are countless classic characters in video games, but we rarely see profound mother figures in games, and we rarely see gameplay themed around mothers. Where did the “mothers” in video games go? This requires us to think and inquire from multiple perspectives such as psychology, the game market, and the industry.</p>
<h2 id="1-Where-Did-Mom-Go"><a href="#1-Where-Did-Mom-Go" class="headerlink" title="1. Where Did Mom Go?"></a>1. Where Did Mom Go?</h2><p>May 8, 2022 (today), happens to be Mother’s Day.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when I was preparing this article, I actually intended to write about the glorious mother figures in games. Maternal love is always touching, and I thought it would be the same in games.</p>
<p>It’s just that when I racked my brains to search for the games I’ve played, the impressive game characters were often fathers. Whether it’s Joel in <em>The Last of Us</em> series, Atreus and his God of War father Kratos, the good dad Ethan in <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, or Kiryu Kazuma and Arakawa Masumi in the <em>Yakuza</em> series, players either act as good dads to take care of children, or have a good dad to lead them to grow.</p>
<p>So where did the mothers in the game go? The conclusion is: they either exist only in the game’s database and text records, or they exit the player’s adventure early. The better ones may still be at home waiting for you to come back (like mom in <em>Pokémon</em>), or send you a letter or some small specialties from time to time (like in <em>Animal Crossing</em> &amp; <em>Story of Seasons</em>); the worse ones may die in childbirth at the beginning, or die soon after as a plot device (<em>Tomb Raider</em>, <em>God of War</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fd5c306a2-0dcb-46ff-98d4-9e3ec3a13dd3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;d5c306a2-0dcb-46ff-98d4-9e3ec3a13dd3.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In Animal Crossing, Mom will periodically send letters to the player.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game developers seem to be finding ways to eliminate the role of mother from the game, as if mom is the biggest BOSS in the game. It makes me ask:</p>
<p>Why do we rarely see the image of “mother” in video games?</p>
<h2 id="2-Archetype-Theory-in-Psychology-and-Player-Experience"><a href="#2-Archetype-Theory-in-Psychology-and-Player-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. Archetype Theory in Psychology and Player Experience"></a>2. Archetype Theory in Psychology and Player Experience</h2><p>People’s perception of the image of “father” and “mother” is often influenced by “stereotypical” images in dramas, legends, and literary works. This subconscious perception of “father” and “mother” is a common phenomenon in different social cultures. The psychology giant Carl Jung defined such a collective subconscious or unconscious cognition of human beings as an “archetype”.</p>
<p>The “archetype” of the father represents an authority figure, strict and powerful; while the “archetype” of the “mother” represents love, care, enthusiasm, compassion, and tolerance. In layman’s terms, when we mention or see “mother” in works, we can often associate it with a gentle, amiable, hardworking, and understanding mother figure wearing an apron. When we think of “father”, we are more likely to portray a serious, unsmiling, tall, and powerful middle-aged man. This is the influence of “archetypes” on us.</p>
<p>In the field of games, most 3A masterpieces tend to bring players exciting adventures or adrenaline-pumping excitement, creating a sense of “insecurity” for players in terms of plot or gameplay. In the design of companion characters, if the player is always accompanied by a mother during the adventure, this sense of insecurity will be largely eliminated—it is difficult for us to imagine that when we are fighting with monsters, there is a mother next to us who keeps nagging “This is too dangerous, come home with me” or the mother steps forward to block in front of you and help you deal with all the problems. I’m afraid the game experience will not be very good.</p>
<p>In the design of the player’s own character image, the “father” image is often more favored by game producers than the “mother” image. Because the image of “father” often symbolizes a guide and strength, which is very consistent with the character image that game producers hope players can experience, and also conforms to the main line of the game that allows players to become stronger in RPG and other games. For example, in <em>The Witcher</em> we play as Geralt, relative to Ciri; in <em>God of War</em>, we play as Kratos, relative to Atreus; Lee in <em>The Walking Dead</em>, relative to Clementine, all are “carrying the burden of tradition, shouldering the dark gate, letting them go to the wide and bright place”.</p>
<p>Therefore, the comfort and coziness brought by the mother image is incompatible with the rebellious and adventurous spirit advocated by most video games, just like a 13-year-old rebellious teenager and his mother.</p>
<p>Of course, not all games use the father’s role as the protagonist. <em>UNDYING</em> for example. Under the ravages of zombies, you, as the protagonist Anling, resist the virus while taking care of your young child Cody in a difficult environment. What the game wants to express is not the common survival and adventure, but the greatness of maternal love. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the mother as the protagonist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fdf238816-fc75-4ab2-a9ca-95df7fdc435c.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;df238816-fc75-4ab2-a9ca-95df7fdc435c.jpg"></p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-Target-Audience-and-Game-Types"><a href="#3-Target-Audience-and-Game-Types" class="headerlink" title="3. Target Audience and Game Types"></a>3. Target Audience and Game Types</h2><p>Another very intuitive but very important factor is the target audience of the game.</p>
<p>In the traditional video game market, male players are often the mainstream. Therefore, for most game manufacturers, it is a very natural thing to target male players and launch male protagonists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of the internet-addicted youths who used to be in arcades or using NES, Windows 95 or Windows 98 are now fathers. NGA, the main base of <em>World of Warcraft</em> players, has also gradually opened up a parenting section in the past few years. The former guild leaders are asking around in the section what kind of milk powder is best for their children. The former 24-hour online internet cafe teenagers complain about their less than one hour of game time every day. These players are still an important audience for games, so we can often see classic game works of “male mothers”.</p>
<p>Conversely, in those purely female-oriented games, or games with a large number of female players, and games that pay more attention to the female game market, the mother element is often more profound. This is more common in many social MMO games or simulation games that focus on life simulation. For example, in <em>Justice Online</em>, there is a baby-raising gameplay, where female characters can be pregnant for ten months and finally give birth to their own baby, becoming a veritable “mother”. Players not only need to pay attention to their physical condition during pregnancy, but also need to help them grow even after the child grows up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fa32d9de3-0694-4f0f-8b6c-e794ded8e75d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;a32d9de3-0694-4f0f-8b6c-e794ded8e75d.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The baby-raising gameplay added in the “Wulin Mengzhu” expansion of Justice Online</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simulation games, it is even more straightforward. <em>Be My Mom</em> on Steam brings you a one-stop experience of being a mother from pregnancy, childbirth, preparing milk powder and diapers, cleaning poop, and creating a baby room. In addition, there will also be some games that are not “mothers” in name but are almost the same as playing mothers, such as the popular casual game <em>Travel Frog</em> a few years ago. Players prepare the frog’s travel backpack, and the frog sets off on its own. You don’t know when it will come back, and you’re not sure what it will bring back to you, which gives people a feeling of “before leaving, the dense stitches, worrying about the late return”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fd2d15d31-b3a4-4c15-9714-0da0d7a4ffab.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;d2d15d31-b3a4-4c15-9714-0da0d7a4ffab.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="4-The-Perspective-and-“Selfishness”-of-Game-Practitioners-and-Producers"><a href="#4-The-Perspective-and-“Selfishness”-of-Game-Practitioners-and-Producers" class="headerlink" title="4. The Perspective and “Selfishness” of Game Practitioners and Producers"></a>4. The Perspective and “Selfishness” of Game Practitioners and Producers</h2><p>The last point that has to be admitted is that many games are also largely influenced by game practitioners or producers in the choice of mother or father roles.</p>
<p>The <em>Yakuza</em> series has many classic good dad-type characters, such as the classic protagonist Kiryu Kazuma. But if we want to find a memorable mother figure in the game, you will suspect that the worldview of <em>Yakuza</em> is that men have children. For the reason for this phenomenon, when we see the photo of the producers of the <em>Yakuza</em> studio, we will generally understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2F1c541a66-0e58-46e3-b6ed-918006aca64f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;1c541a66-0e58-46e3-b6ed-918006aca64f.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Group photo of the new Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A domestic report disclosed by Gamma Data in 2017 also showed that the number of male game practitioners is about three times that of female game practitioners. The male-dominated game industry naturally cannot avoid the trend of male perspectives dominating game production. It is difficult for these rough men to tell a story about mothers, unless the company’s leader is Patrick Star.</p>
<p>Of course, the gender bias of game practitioners themselves is one reason, and the “selfishness” of individual producers often also affects the amount of mother or father elements.</p>
<p>Neil Druckman, one of the producers of <em>The Last of Us</em>, became a father during the game’s production. He also frankly stated that his daughter gave him great inspiration in portraying the “father-daughter” relationship between Ellie and Joel. He realized the importance of family and was “willing to do anything for his daughter”, which also affected the development of the game’s related plot.</p>
<p>Cory Barlog, the producer of <em>God of War</em>, also said in an interview that he projected his own image onto the protagonist Kratos. He is usually busy with work and cannot be with his children. Any parent will feel confused about how to educate their children and is always looking for changes, just like Kratos and Atreus in the game. In addition to the father, the image of the mother will also be affected by “selfishness”. On Mother’s Day in 2020, Paradox uploaded a promotional video for its upcoming game <em>Empire of Sin</em> on its YouTube channel. The reason for choosing Mother’s Day for promotion is that one of the female mafia godmothers in the game is based on the great-grandmother of the game producer Romero couple - they want to commemorate their great-grandmother in this special way and express their respect for Mother’s Day.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, the reasons why we rarely see the existence of mother figures in games are: on the one hand, many games themselves are not suitable for the existence of “mothers”. The sense of security and attachment that “mothers” bring to players is incompatible with the adventurous and rebellious spirit of video games; on the other hand, it is also the choice of the game market. The male-dominated game market also determines that the “mother” element is difficult to resonate with and be substituted by players; finally, the gender differences of game practitioners themselves and some selfishness of game producers also inevitably affect the overall design of the game.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, as the gender ratio of the game industry and the game market has gradually become balanced, more rich and diverse game types and themes have emerged. The high wall that keeps “mothers” away from games is constantly collapsing. We have indeed seen more and more “mothers” shine in games, and more and more games have begun to design gameplay with a mother’s perspective. Whether it’s Ana in <em>Overwatch</em> or Mad Maggie in <em>Apex Legends</em>, game producers are also practicing such a truth:</p>
<p>Video games themselves do not exclude the existence of “mothers”. Whether the image in the game is “mother” or “father” is determined by what kind of experience the player wants to have.</p>

<p>If one day we want to experience a warm and comfortable journey in the game, it is not impossible to join a nagging mother to accompany you.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to dedicate this article to all mothers in the world, Happy Mother’s Day!</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220607/28584_1022875.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a lot of interpersonal relationships in real life. Besides ourselves, we have parents, siblings, relatives, partners, children, friends, and other relationship chains. If we compare ourselves to a small stone, throwing this stone into the water, the ripples that spread out are people with varying degrees of intimacy with us.</p>
<p>In academic research, there are two types of intimate relationships: broad intimate relationships and narrow intimate relationships. Broad intimate relationships include parent-child relationships, kinship, friendships, partner relationships, and so on. Narrow intimate relationships in academia refer more to partner relationships, that is, the two parties in the relationship are lovers.</p>
<p>This article mainly focuses on narrow intimate relationships, introducing how online intimate relationships are formed, consumption affected by intimate relationships, and its inspiration for user research. At the same time, for many people, partner relationships have a very strong impact on people’s lives and happiness (Berscheid and Reis, 1998) - this kind of intimate relationship with a partner can be said to be one of the most important relationships for people.</p>
<h2 id="1-Online-Intimate-Relationships-and-Intimate-Relationships-in-Games"><a href="#1-Online-Intimate-Relationships-and-Intimate-Relationships-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Online Intimate Relationships and Intimate Relationships in Games"></a>1. Online Intimate Relationships and Intimate Relationships in Games</h2><p>With the Internet now deeply penetrating thousands of households, communication through the Internet has become very common. And this communication is not limited to the traditional sending and receiving of messages, but extends to the sharing and display of personal unique messages and the establishment of online interpersonal relationships with others. People on the Internet may be a replica of their real life, or they may be very different from themselves in real life. Some people are even more “socially phobic” in real life, but they are like fish in water on the Internet and can find friends more easily.</p>
<p>In this case, online intimate relationships have also emerged. Perhaps, this phenomenon can be crudely explained as “online dating.” Online intimate relationships are different from intimate relationships in reality. On the Internet, the two parties in an intimate relationship may not have met, but the Internet provides them with a place and scene for communication.</p>
<p>How do online intimate relationships form? Some studies have shown that online intimate relationships reflect a spiritual intimacy. They are willing to reveal themselves to each other and share their worldview (Merkle and Richardson, 2000). On the Internet, due to the existence of anonymity, people tend to reveal themselves more when they meet strangers than in real life, and feel more comfortable expressing themselves to others than in real life. More self-disclosure lays the foundation for the development of online intimate relationships. When the two parties get to know each other in constant self-disclosure and establish a sense of trust, it will make their feelings more intimate. In general, the Internet provides channels and scenarios for both parties to show themselves to each other. People can show what they are like to each other according to their own ideas, which on the one hand pleases themselves, and on the other hand also promotes the budding of the relationship between the two parties.</p>
<p>The formation process of online intimate relationships also has obvious drawbacks. What both parties reveal to each other is what they want the other party to see, that is, there is some beautification behavior. Under the beautification behavior, both parties will form a more positive impression of each other. In addition to the information sent may be beautified, the person receiving the information may also beautify this information, constructing a perfect image in their mind.</p>
<p>The intimate relationship in the game is a typical online intimate relationship. Games provide players with a stage to show each other. Players complete various tasks in the game. They will clear a certain dungeon together, fight a small&#x2F;large battle together, explore the entire game world together, and take photos at beautiful scenic spots together. Games not only provide players with the opportunity to reveal themselves, but also create some content for self-disclosure that other online intimate relationships do not have. That is, game players can show what kind of people they are through the game, and the game itself is also the content they display - PVE commander, gang leader, puzzle solver, etc. The game enriches the connotation that people can reveal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Fdccd2ca7-0b42-44b4-b379-a9521b7f086f.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;dccd2ca7-0b42-44b4-b379-a9521b7f086f.jpg"></p>
<p>In addition, many games, especially MMOs, also provide “official endorsement” for online intimate relationships. Players can form couples or even marry in the game, making the intimate relationship in the game more solemn.</p>
<h2 id="2-Intimate-Relationships-and-In-Game-Purchases"><a href="#2-Intimate-Relationships-and-In-Game-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="2. Intimate Relationships and In-Game Purchases"></a>2. Intimate Relationships and In-Game Purchases</h2><p>Intimate relationships can influence users’ purchases to a certain extent. For example, we often see couples buying couple outfits, couple accessories (such as couple rings, mobile phone cases), and using couple avatars to show their partner relationship with their significant other. In psychology, we use the consistency pursued by both partners to explain this phenomenon, that is, the two parties in an intimate relationship use consistent things to show their intimacy. The same is true in games. Many “couples” in games will show their couple relationship by purchasing men’s&#x2F;women’s fashion of the same series, purchasing the same accessories and pendants, and using couple names that are antithetical.</p>
<p>In this case, the game will also set up corresponding content to meet the consistency pursued by both parties in the intimate relationship. For example, <em>Justice Online</em> will release matching couple outfits for men and women on Valentine’s Day, Qixi Festival, 520, and other important lover’s festivals, which has been well received by players.</p>

<p>But do both parties in an intimate relationship always pursue this consistency? Not necessarily. When the two parties in an intimate relationship become more and more intimate, they will regard each other as part of their self-awareness, that is, the two people are one. In this case, they will involuntarily complement each other when making purchases. For example, in the game, one party already owns pet A. In the eyes of the other party, they, as a whole, both own pet A. Therefore, in the following choices, they will tend to buy pet B or other things. Because in the eyes of the other party, he&#x2F;she already owns pet A, so he&#x2F;she will not spend resources on repeated purchases, but will buy others to enrich the items they all have.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a friend’s intimate relationship, not a couple’s relationship, to illustrate. For example, <em>Justice Online</em> launched seven clothes with the same style but different color schemes on Double Eleven in 2021. Many “sisters” in the game each own one. The “Seven Fairies” standing together include all color schemes, which is very eye-catching. Each member psychologically believes that they have more than one, and the ownership of friends satisfies the player’s psychology to a certain extent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220607%2Ffa389301-81a7-48c5-8c37-6e455101ca87.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220607&#x2F;fa389301-81a7-48c5-8c37-6e455101ca87.png"></p>
<p>So when we as user researchers study this situation, we must pay attention not to look at the problem with a single eye, but to combine the factors that affect the behavior of intimate relationships, such as the intimacy between partners, the characteristics of the product, etc., and consider the real needs of both parties. When they will tend to consistent consumption and when they will tend to complementary consumption, there are different answers in different scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, the intimate relationship that this article focuses on and discusses is a narrow intimate relationship. From a broad perspective, parent-child, kinship, friends, etc. are all within the scope of intimate relationships. They are also affected by intimacy and other factors to a certain extent. Will affect the behavior of users&#x2F;players. These interpersonal relationships can more or less find a correspondence in current online games - such as sworn brothers, fixed teams, gangs, etc. commonly seen in major games. Therefore, broad intimate relationships are also worthy of attention for user researchers, especially game user experience researchers.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220608/28584_1023012.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>

<h2 id="GDC-2022"><a href="#GDC-2022" class="headerlink" title="GDC 2022"></a>GDC 2022</h2><p>From March 21st to March 25th this year, GDC 2022, the world’s largest, most authoritative, and most influential professional summit in the global game industry, was grandly held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In this year’s GDC, Leihuo UX was invited to give 17 presentations, distributed in 9 core presentations and 8 summit presentations, once again breaking the record of the Chinese game industry and leading the world.</p>
<p>This article introduces the presentation “Automation in Practice: A Guide to Procedural Content Generation” by Zhou Yi, Senior Data Analyst at Leihuo UX, and Tianpeng, Data Mining Engineer at Leihuo UX.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-We-Encountered-in-Game-Development"><a href="#Problems-We-Encountered-in-Game-Development" class="headerlink" title="Problems We Encountered in Game Development"></a>Problems We Encountered in Game Development</h2><p>When generating content and terrain for games, we encounter multiple problems, and these problems are likely to exist in many game design processes. For example, players always complain that the map design is unfair, the spawn points are unreasonable, the resources are unbalanced, and so on. For another example, given two maps, how to compare which map is better and fairer to both sides? Under a specific map, is it still fair if the two teams have different numbers of players? Is it easy to obtain items at the beginning? What size of the map can ensure fairness? Which random generation algorithm to choose? These are all likely to exist.</p>
<p>The above summarizes the problems encountered in the generation of random content (such as maps). Next, we will explain how we use mathematical methods to achieve automated content generation from the perspectives of practice and simulation programs.</p>
<p>In practice, from spawn point settings to map item placement, it will greatly affect the initial growth of players. The growth of players in the middle and late stages of the game mainly depends on the players’ own skills. Therefore, in order to reduce the interference of irrelevant factors (such as the operation and skills of different players), we will compare the effectiveness and fairness of the map in the early stage of the game. Comprehensive simulation experiments are an effective way to test these hypotheses, and the method of controlling variables is the key to simulation experiments.</p>
<h2 id="The-Simulation-Experiment-We-Designed"><a href="#The-Simulation-Experiment-We-Designed" class="headerlink" title="The Simulation Experiment We Designed"></a>The Simulation Experiment We Designed</h2><p>In order to conduct simulation experiments, we designed a program. The background of the program is that two teams (red team and blue team) mine gold mines on the edge of a snow mountain, and both the gold mines and the snow mountain are algorithm-generated. The red team randomly spawns in the west (i.e., the left half), and the blue team randomly spawns in the east (i.e., the right half). Each team member uses the same pathfinding strategy. The game ends if the two teams meet (i.e., early stage) or the gold mine resources are exhausted. When the two teams meet for the first time, they may fight or share gold mine information, which will bring the game into the middle and late stages.</p>
<p>Why do we use data from the early stages for experiments? First, these data are relatively easy to interpret, and the experimental results can be better applied to the application. In addition, the time-consuming of a single experiment is also a factor we consider. The faster a single experiment is, the more experiments we can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F0d64b8e5-a49c-44e6-9fba-561676f66104.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;0d64b8e5-a49c-44e6-9fba-561676f66104.png"></p>
<h2 id="The-Mathematical-Model-We-Designed"><a href="#The-Mathematical-Model-We-Designed" class="headerlink" title="The Mathematical Model We Designed"></a>The Mathematical Model We Designed</h2><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2Fff76ae9e-ed34-4bfc-b357-33659571300b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;ff76ae9e-ed34-4bfc-b357-33659571300b.png"></p>
<p>In our mathematical model, the difference in gold coins obtained by two teams in a single game can reflect the difference in spawn points and resource locations, because they all use the same pathfinding method. The variance of the gold coin difference caused by thousands of games can reflect the stability of the map; the expectation of multiple experiments can reflect the fairness of the map; the variance of different maps can compare the quality of the map; the variance of different random generation algorithms can compare the effectiveness of the map.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the following two maps, one with snow mountain piles and gold coin piles, and the other with only scattered gold coins. Can you directly see which map is more beneficial to the red team (born in the left half area)? Through our mathematical model, we do 3,000 experiments on each map, and we can now get the density map of the gold coin difference between the red team and the blue team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2Fcfdc930d-a5fc-4d50-8d4c-38540592a51d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;cfdc930d-a5fc-4d50-8d4c-38540592a51d.png"></p>
<p>After our model analysis, Map 2 is symmetrical about the zero point, and it is more stable because the curve is narrow and high. Map 1 is not symmetrical, although its peak is zero. In addition, Map 1 has multiple peaks, and we can roughly see that Map 1 is more beneficial to the blue team. Now, we can do a Z-Test to verify this hypothesis: Map 1 is more beneficial to the blue team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F2c26a352-fdb0-475c-8991-fc6fc47a4eff.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;2c26a352-fdb0-475c-8991-fc6fc47a4eff.png"></p>
<p>After the significance test, we know that the hypothesis is correct, that is, Map 1 is indeed more beneficial to the blue team.</p>
<h2 id="Ways-to-Make-the-Map-Fair"><a href="#Ways-to-Make-the-Map-Fair" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Make the Map Fair"></a>Ways to Make the Map Fair</h2><p>We did a few things. First, we tried to determine the map size and team size. Generally, the larger the map, the smoother the curve, that is, the smaller the variance of the gold coin difference between the two teams, indicating that the stability of the map is higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F5f53de8f-12c9-4602-ba8d-9a2158387cfe.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;5f53de8f-12c9-4602-ba8d-9a2158387cfe.png"></p>
<p>On the other hand, as the number of red team members increases, the result is more beneficial to the red team; and as the number of blue team members increases, the result is more beneficial to the blue team. It can be seen that the number of people can indeed change the fairness of the map. This also answers the questions we raised earlier. The following table shows the μ values under different team sizes, where rows represent the blue team and columns represent the red team. It can be seen that most of the values in the table are negative, indicating that in most cases, the map is beneficial to the blue team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F1ea42523-35f3-43e9-b2d1-45e81554917e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;1ea42523-35f3-43e9-b2d1-45e81554917e.png"></p>
<p>In addition, we also designed a pathfinding algorithm, specifically referring to the strategy by which each person in the team finds gold coins, because the coefficient indicators of pathfinding may affect the final result of the experimental model. For the reliability of simulation experiments, when considering pathfinding strategy coefficients, at least 5 principles should be referred to: Everyone (AI) is always greedy for obtaining gold coins; they do not always follow a fixed route, but the randomness is limited; everyone uses the same pathfinding algorithm; they have a certain ability to escape traps; and they conform to human behavior characteristics. The following is a pathfinding strategy coefficient we designed. You can also design your own algorithm, but you need to consider these 5 principles when designing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2Fe8ed45e3-7dbb-4696-9c10-c54b8ed2ab9b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;e8ed45e3-7dbb-4696-9c10-c54b8ed2ab9b.png"></p>
<p>And, we designed a random generation algorithm. The function of the random content generator is to generate obstacles, reward items, and so on. The mainstream algorithms are uniform distribution selection, Perlin noise, Fractal noise, etc. Here, we take uniform distribution as an example to illustrate how the random content generator works. The first step is to generate a matrix of the same size as the map, and each value is sampled according to a uniform distribution between 0.0 and 1.0. The second step is to traverse all elements of the matrix and get the positions with the largest k values. The third step is to display gold coins (or snow mountains) at these k positions.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the gold coins generated by the uniform distribution selection algorithm. The left side is the value of the matrix, and the right side is the position of the gold coins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F7de40efd-6aee-4618-b20d-018e45ac0df3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;7de40efd-6aee-4618-b20d-018e45ac0df3.png"></p>
<p>The figure below shows the snow mountain generated by Perlin noise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F07b35e90-53c9-4b4f-b011-e264711210a7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;07b35e90-53c9-4b4f-b011-e264711210a7.png"></p>
<p>The figure below shows the snow mountain generated by Fractal noise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F085019c6-62c7-4f35-83aa-9e8b1e535ceb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;085019c6-62c7-4f35-83aa-9e8b1e535ceb.png"></p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Now that we have the mathematical tools, how can we automate the content generation process?</p>
<p>First, design the map scale, reward quantity, obstacle quantity, and player quantity according to expert knowledge. Step two, set our indicator baseline, for example, sigma cannot exceed 30. Step three, define the “early stage”. Step four, choose the appropriate random generation algorithm. Step five, generate multiple simplified maps. Step six, conduct thousands of simulations on these simplified maps. Step seven, calculate the indicators. Finally, accept maps that meet the baseline.</p>

<p>This article introduces the presentation “The Art of Hair in Games: Aesthetics and Production for Eastern and Western Players” by Leihuo art expert Nora &amp; Leihuo UX game user researcher Alex. The following is the transcript of the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F9a0cfc9d-621a-4fde-a9fb-e28d38732e8d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;9a0cfc9d-621a-4fde-a9fb-e28d38732e8d.png"></p>
<h2 id="Foreword"><a href="#Foreword" class="headerlink" title="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2><p>When we make next-generation games, we often pay great attention to the effect of character presentation, and hair is a very important part of it. Interestingly, many games with Eastern themes and games with Western themes have many aesthetic similarities and differences. We have compiled some interesting feelings and experiences to share with you. There are many interesting points, and this presentation will focus on the aspect of hair.</p>
<h2 id="Similarities-in-Eastern-and-Western-Hairstyle-Aesthetics-and-Design"><a href="#Similarities-in-Eastern-and-Western-Hairstyle-Aesthetics-and-Design" class="headerlink" title="Similarities in Eastern and Western Hairstyle Aesthetics and Design"></a>Similarities in Eastern and Western Hairstyle Aesthetics and Design</h2><p>From the perspective of art design, hairstyle design is implementable. Whether it is Eastern or Western, the design of hairstyles will be extracted from the elements of actual hairstyles in life for secondary creation. For example, braids and short hair. In <em>Justice Online</em>, some design elements are also extracted from daily life styles. Everyone can feel that, whether it is Eastern games or Western games, the design and aesthetics of hairstyles are not fabricated out of thin air, but are created using elements from reality. In terms of technology application, the mainstream is also to use hair card technology to make hairstyles. With the improvement of hardware, some games also use dynamic hair simulation technology to show better effects. These technologies are based on the workflow of hair strands, so that the created hairstyles are displayed with real-time simulation effects.</p>

<h2 id="Differences-in-Eastern-and-Western-Hairstyle-Aesthetics"><a href="#Differences-in-Eastern-and-Western-Hairstyle-Aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Differences in Eastern and Western Hairstyle Aesthetics"></a>Differences in Eastern and Western Hairstyle Aesthetics</h2><p>If you have visited ancient Chinese and Western classical paintings in museums, you will find that the two are completely different systems. Relatively speaking, Western classical painting focuses on light and shadow, perspective, and anatomical structure, expressing the material world and entities. It can be said that Western aesthetics mainly lies in reproduction, and it attaches great importance to the beauty of realism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F8dd0f0da-9e4c-4f0f-a484-9a9ee2427de6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;8dd0f0da-9e4c-4f0f-a484-9a9ee2427de6.png"></p>
<p>Relatively speaking, ancient Eastern paintings are more of an expression of personal feelings than a depiction of the real world. For example, the Chinese national treasure “A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains”, we can feel the beauty of mountains and rivers from the paintings, but it does not completely conform to light and shadow, perspective, and structure, which is the expression of lines and feelings that Chinese painting emphasizes. Due to this difference between Eastern and Western aesthetics - the reproduction of reality and the expression of emotion, it has caused differences in the aesthetics of hairstyle design in Eastern and Western themed games, and also the differences in the acceptance of hairstyle aesthetics by players. Therefore, Western-themed games pay more attention to the rationality of hairstyles during the protagonist’s fighting process. Many Eastern-themed games will pay more attention to the silhouette, contour, and beauty of the shape.</p>

<h2 id="Four-Key-Considerations-in-Game-Hairstyle-Art-Design"><a href="#Four-Key-Considerations-in-Game-Hairstyle-Art-Design" class="headerlink" title="Four Key Considerations in Game Hairstyle Art Design"></a>Four Key Considerations in Game Hairstyle Art Design</h2><p>After talking about some discussions on aesthetics, we will now enter another major module of our presentation, which is also the four key considerations of our team in game hairstyle art design, that is, how can we better implement interesting and beautiful hairstyles in games.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-History-Experience"><a href="#Part-1-History-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: History - Experience"></a>Part 1: History - Experience</h3><p>Hair has completely different manifestations in different historical stages, becoming more and more refined and diverse. Hairstyles can symbolize personal identity, status, culture, etc. In game design, we can make full use of hairstyles with characteristics of the times and history to better tell stories.</p>
<p>The design of hairstyles that conform to the background of the character’s era in the game can give players a good immersive experience when they first enter the game, and they will not feel out of place. This historical immersion is not only well represented in games with Eastern themes, but also in many other cultural themes. For example, the hairstyles in <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em> show that players know that the story background of this game is in ancient Egypt without any text introduction. Similarly, the hairstyles of the characters in <em>God of War</em> can intuitively reflect the background of the ancient Greek era in which they are located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F1c57c573-cd1e-46ff-9dd1-ec3961ce4f7e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;1c57c573-cd1e-46ff-9dd1-ec3961ce4f7e.png"></p>
<h3 id="Part-2-Diversity-Individuality"><a href="#Part-2-Diversity-Individuality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Diversity - Individuality"></a>Part 2: Diversity - Individuality</h3><p>From the perspective of personalization, the specific clothing and hairstyles of certain game characters are highly personalized, which helps to show the characteristics of the characters. For example, the protagonist of <em>Judgment</em>, Takayuki Yagami, has a unique hairstyle that is memorable. This is the strong memory point that the “personality” of the hairstyle brings to players.</p>
<p>In some other games, by providing a large number of hairstyle customization options, game players are provided with more diverse different customized appearances and unique hairstyles, which can give players a better user experience. On the basis of hairstyle diversification, personality customization can also be provided through adjustments such as hair color decoration.</p>
<p>NetEase Leihuo Games also attaches great importance to diversified and personalized design. For example, there are many interesting hairstyles in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. This is a hairstyle that combines a very masculine basic style, the mohawk, with very feminine long curly hair. The designer combines two completely opposite temperament hairstyles together, and the designed style matches the male face, which has a strong personality and characteristics, and can also make players have a strong memory point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F1bbf8be9-ccfe-48d3-9e38-0612d7c09a7d.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;1bbf8be9-ccfe-48d3-9e38-0612d7c09a7d.jpg"></p>
<p>In short, diversification and personalization are two sides of the same coin. Whether it is personalized design or diversified choices, it is to better provide players with memory points and immersion, and bring a better gaming experience.</p>
<h3 id="Part-3-Contrast-Memory"><a href="#Part-3-Contrast-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Contrast - Memory"></a>Part 3: Contrast - Memory</h3><p>In most cases, the design of various hairstyles and dresses for characters in games is mainly for aesthetic purposes. But sometimes, the hairstyle itself carries strong character and temperament characteristics. For example, long curly hair will naturally make people think of a gentle female character; but if this hairstyle is matched with a male face full of beard, it will produce a strong sense of conflict, which will also give players a relatively strong memory point. Even if you haven’t entered a certain scene with this character&#x2F;role, you already want to find out if something interesting has happened to him.</p>
<p>This is a Boss from <em>Justice Online</em>. The hairstyle design of bald head + braid has a strong memory point, and it is also very in line with the evil personality that the boss should have. This hairstyle can be obtained when the player defeats the boss. In this game, if the player’s face is more delicate and soft, with such an evil hairstyle, the evil temperament is completely absent, and it is even a little funny and impressive, and it is successfully remembered in the guild or player community. This is the effect brought by the hairstyle design with a huge contrast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2Ff673b1bc-643c-4c6e-ba37-9251f9bcdfc0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;f673b1bc-643c-4c6e-ba37-9251f9bcdfc0.png"></p>
<h3 id="Part-4-Breaking-Labels-Universal-Values"><a href="#Part-4-Breaking-Labels-Universal-Values" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Breaking Labels - Universal Values"></a>Part 4: Breaking Labels - Universal Values</h3><p>Game planners or designers, film directors&#x2F;producers, often use specific hairstyles to directly define the personality characteristics of a character. However, sometimes such designs can have some undesirable effects. Why? Because using specific hairstyles to define a character will make games or film and television works lack diversity. In addition to hairstyles, the character’s personality can also be highlighted through other aspects of design.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some other examples of labeling. For example, the slicked-back hair in the picture is easy to associate with the mafia when you first see it. This is actually adding a natural label to this type of character. However, this hairstyle is used on some people, and it reflects more of a cool form and personality characteristics, and has nothing to do with his profession. This label should not be pinned on a person so quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F13bae211-0bd4-4446-97f9-8c88cb2fdf31.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;13bae211-0bd4-4446-97f9-8c88cb2fdf31.png"></p>
<p>If we can break this inherent label when designing hairstyles, and add other elements to the design process of the character’s personality characteristics, and give the character richer and more complete character information from this perspective, then there will be many stories and cultural phenomena worth exploring, not just a kind of head hairstyle design art.</p>
<p>So, as game designers, how to transform this design that breaks traditional labels into games?</p>
<h4 id="Develop-and-apply-a-diversified-headdress-system"><a href="#Develop-and-apply-a-diversified-headdress-system" class="headerlink" title="Develop and apply a diversified headdress system"></a>Develop and apply a diversified headdress system</h4><p>Game designers are prone to some labeling processing when designing character roles. For example, expensive hairpins, warrior helmets. However, if you have a rich and diverse hair decoration system, you can reduce the presence of labels a lot.</p>
<p>In <em>Justice Online</em>, we have designed and applied a diversified hair decoration system. Various hair accessories allow players to have many different collocations, and other players also have more desire to explore the story behind the character and socialize with the player behind the character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220608%2F276004a7-651a-4ebe-aa24-bc180b00dce5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220608&#x2F;276004a7-651a-4ebe-aa24-bc180b00dce5.png"></p>
<h4 id="Design-a-creative-hair-shape-customization-system"><a href="#Design-a-creative-hair-shape-customization-system" class="headerlink" title="Design a creative hair shape customization system"></a>Design a creative hair shape customization system</h4><p>We don’t want warriors in a game to only have bald heads, buzz cuts, or short hair. They can all have very different collocations in the hands of players. This attempt can also make players more tolerant and accepting of the character’s own hairstyle and appearance.</p>
<h4 id="Hair-dyeing-system-design-based-on-diversity-and-high-aesthetics"><a href="#Hair-dyeing-system-design-based-on-diversity-and-high-aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Hair dyeing system design based on diversity and high aesthetics"></a>Hair dyeing system design based on diversity and high aesthetics</h4><p>This can also be called our efforts in breaking the label of game character hairstyle design. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, this dyeing system can also be used for any hair color matching, allowing players to create freely and be remembered by other players. We have no conventions, no fixed labels. The dyeing system gives this label a harsher soil for survival.</p>
<h4 id="Multi-faceted-display-of-the-integration-of-different-cultures"><a href="#Multi-faceted-display-of-the-integration-of-different-cultures" class="headerlink" title="Multi-faceted display of the integration of different cultures"></a>Multi-faceted display of the integration of different cultures</h4><p>When designing games, based on the premise of conforming to the background of the times, strive to do cultural integration and multi-faceted display of different cultures. This point is of far-reaching significance, and we will continue to do so.</p>

    <title>How &quot;Zen&quot; Game Experiences Capture the Hearts of Players</title>
    <url>/2022/06/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20220615_28584_1024301/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220615/28584_1024301.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Unpacking</em> is a healing, zen-like puzzle game developed by Witch Beam, released in November 2021. The main content of the game revolves around a familiar experience – moving. While creating a comfortable living space, you will gradually learn about the life of the baggage owner. The game combines elements of block puzzles and home decoration. There is no timer, no meter, or score. All you can do is pack, organize, and place items where you think they belong.</p>
<p>The game developer used “zen” to describe their game, which describes a game mode that “imposes as few restrictions as possible on the player.” This type of game mode has also appeared in other games, such as the “Zen Garden” in <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, which often presents different forms depending on the type of game, but they don’t seem to have caused much of a stir.</p>
<p>Its “free and unrestricted” feature seems to contradict the concept of mainstream games, which leads to “zen” games almost always having low interactivity and overly simple game mechanics. You can complete the entire <em>Unpacking</em> without any tutorials. All you can do in the game is place the items taken out of the box, which is very simple for a game. But such a “simple” game is loved by players and has been nominated for multiple awards. Does it rely solely on its so-called “free, unrestricted, leisurely, and never-failing” features? How do “zen” games capture the hearts of players?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Zen”-and-Aesthetic-Experience"><a href="#1-“Zen”-and-Aesthetic-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. “Zen” and Aesthetic Experience"></a>1. “Zen” and Aesthetic Experience</h2><p>Let’s trace back to the origin of “Zen”. “Zen” comes from the “Chan” of Zen Buddhism, which is familiar to Chinese people. When this word was introduced to European and American countries, the word even deviated from its original meaning in Zen Buddhism,凝聚了西方人对于神秘的东方智慧的向往与好奇，becoming a pronoun for its subjective impression of Eastern philosophy and even Far Eastern style. For example, the “Zen” mentioned in some games often just borrows the name of “Zen”, but in fact there is no “Zen” reality, only superficiality.</p>
<p>As a design culture with a strong subjective experience, the “Zen” style represents the essence of traditional Chinese culture. The philosophical basis of the “Zen” style is composed of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and incorporates the wisdom of traditional humanities and philosophy. For example, the “natural” and “free” thinking in Taoist theory, through meditation to perceive the purity and perfection that already exists in one’s heart. It requires to perceive Zen from green mountains and green water, to experience Zen joy from one’s own daily life, and to realize the transcendence of life and spiritual freedom in the flowing and impermanent life.</p>
<p>If we apply this Nirvana thought to real life, it will make people feel satisfied, happy, and excited, and add to the情趣of life. This kind of emotion is a spontaneous expression of following nature, which will make people obtain a special pleasant experience, that is, aesthetic experience, from the perceptual intuition of nature and all things in the universe, thereby greatly improving people’s life. “Zen” games can bring players a relaxing and immersive spiritual experience. In this state of “spiritual tranquility”, the audience abandons the external world and inner distractions, concentrates their thoughts, and returns to their nature. It is like an energy that ignites people’s inner feelings and potential memories, forming more emotional works, naturally presenting the inner world of the audience. Zen games attract players through their aesthetic experience that is different from other games. Next, we will talk about how to gain aesthetic experience from games.</p>
<h2 id="2-Aesthetic-Experience-in-Games"><a href="#2-Aesthetic-Experience-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Aesthetic Experience in Games"></a>2. Aesthetic Experience in Games</h2><p>The famous psychologist Maslow once said that there are five basic needs in a person’s life, and these needs are like a ladder, gradually upgrading and accompanying a person’s life. People’s aesthetic needs actually exist in people’s subconscious, but they are rarely discovered. Such aesthetic needs also exist in video games. Early video games attracted us mainly by human primal impulses. With the development of electronic technology, the experience that games bring to people has begun to “evolve” from the primal impulses of survival and plunder to more delicate and subtle empathy and nourishment mechanisms. The design of video games has gradually begun to pay attention to the aesthetic experience of games.</p>
<p>Designing game works with deep connotations and artistic value is inseparable from game mechanics. For example, traditional artworks, on the one hand, fully display the “appearance” carefully designed by the artist, that is, the sensory experience, and on the other hand, contain deeper connotations that need to be gradually explored, that is, “connotation”. For video game works, “connotation” is its internal mechanism, which is the inner, deep, and indispensable element of the game. It reflects modern people’s pursuit of aesthetics and cultural values, and affects the gameplay of the game. While emphasizing the interactivity of the game, showing the deeper aesthetic experience of the game can enable the majority of game players to have a better gaming experience.</p>
<p>Early games on Nintendo’s 8-bit and 16-bit consoles were action games, and the operability reflected in front of players through these game mechanics became the main gameplay of these games. With the continuous development of video games and the enrichment of game types, different game types have incorporated different game elements. For example, RTS games pay more attention to the gameplay that emphasizes strategy and micromanagement, while FPS games focus on mazes, tasks, and tactical coordination. Different mechanisms reflect different game experiences, but no matter what kind of game experience, their design starting point reflects human civilization and social culture, and expresses the designer’s cultural values, aesthetic tastes, etc. Therefore, the game mechanism can also be said to be an important aesthetic feature of game art.</p>
<p>The aesthetic experience is based on the aesthetic characteristics of the game and human-computer interaction, and is a dynamic process. It is a subtle exchange between the player’s various psychological elements such as perception, imagination, emotion, and understanding and the game in the process of interacting with the game world.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fc9618abd-45ae-4494-9689-fed5d26f5646.png/size/" alt="MDA Framework"></p>
<p>In 2004, American scholar LeBlanc et al. proposed the “MDA model” of video games, pointing out that in game design, it is often the internal mechanism (Mechanics) of the game that determines the dynamic interaction (Dynamics) of the game, and then conveys the core emotion (Aesthetics) of the game to the player. He believes that the “fun” of the game is actually the aesthetics of the game. Players feel the experience that the designer hopes to bring through the mechanism through the dynamic interaction part. This interaction is not only the player’s operation, but also includes visual and auditory language, including the experience that players get from the game environment, game art, and game music. We use the following table for intuitive explanation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fd6bbc770-2e76-4e8c-90e7-f1520de64e62.png/size/" alt="Video Game Aesthetic Experience and Game Design Process"></p>
<p>From this table, we can see that the aesthetic experience of the game is a dynamic process carried out in stages. Players first come into contact with the interaction layer, that is, external effects (pictures, music, special effects, etc.). The external effect is passively accepted by the player, but the operability of the game gives the player the initiative to practice, and the player obtains a sensory experience at this level. But more important is the core layer of the game, where players will gain a psychological and emotional experience. The sublimation from psychological “pleasure” to philosophical “pleasure” depends on the emotions and cultural values in the game, and relies on the player’s understanding, judgment, and comprehension of the game mechanism.</p>
<p>With the continuous development of graphics and image technology, the graphics of video games have evolved from pixel-level to today’s next-generation quality in order to continuously improve the immersion of the game. However, any art form is not deeply rooted in people’s hearts only by the sensory surface feelings, but more by its cultural connotations. To create an aesthetic experience for players is to transform complex game rules into an experience process, so that players can rise from emotional identification to the deep “understanding” of the soul.</p>
<h2 id="3-When-We-Design-Games-with-a-“Zen”-Style"><a href="#3-When-We-Design-Games-with-a-“Zen”-Style" class="headerlink" title="3. When We Design Games with a “Zen” Style"></a>3. When We Design Games with a “Zen” Style</h2><h3 id="Abandoning-Complex-Core-Mechanism-Choices"><a href="#Abandoning-Complex-Core-Mechanism-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Abandoning Complex Core Mechanism Choices"></a>Abandoning Complex Core Mechanism Choices</h3><p>Zhuangzi believed that “heaven and man were originally one, but the moral norms and典章制度(diǎn zhāng zhì dù - rules and regulations) designated in the human world make people lose their original nature, and become incompatible with nature. Only by ‘abandoning the sage and discarding wisdom’ can human nature be liberated, return to nature, enter into the ‘sitting and forgetting’ of emptiness and clarity, and then elevate to the spiritual realm of ‘all things and I are one’.”</p>
<p>As early as the 17th century, Schiller proposed the famous “game theory”, the purpose of which is simple, that is, to illustrate that “free games” have the characteristics of non-utilitarianism. Zen games abandon complex mechanisms, there are no settings such as stamina bar, ability bar, item bar, etc., starting from emotions, emphasizing their aesthetics and freedom, and bringing players into a “flow” state. The creation of Zen games often stems from this concept of purifying people’s hearts, establishing a virtual world that can be immersed in “pure emotion” interaction without any disputes. Here we can feel another new field outside of other games that pursue excitement and a sense of accomplishment - a journey of the soul. This “journey” allows our body and mind to be completely immersed in the “tranquility” and “Zen” aesthetic experience far away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>So, in addition to abandoning complexity, what exactly does it do? We have already explained that, in order to obtain what kind of aesthetic experience, in addition to the cultural connotation of the game itself, the game mechanism is very important. And the design of the core mechanism of Zen games is very different.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F4f1ccdee-a4d5-4bde-b4ac-134c6777f5f1.jpg/size/" alt="Core Mechanism Design Principle"></p>
<p>In this core design model, in the middle is the core mechanism, and outwards are the secondary mechanism, progression, story, or “hero myth”. The core mechanism is a behavior pattern in which players need to frequently use this element to interact with the game. It works with the other three layers on the player’s brain, and then conveys a specific experience to the player. We take the classic Zen game <em>Flower</em> as an example to analyze the core mechanism design of Zen games.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F0166b2af-3f65-41d8-8101-eb8f70be7670.png/size/" alt="*Flower* Core Mechanism Design"></p>
<p>We can see that “flying” as the core mechanism of the game has a free and romantic color, and the behavior patterns of the secondary mechanism have an inherent interaction and connection with the natural world. Players play the role of invisible wind and use petals to revive flowers, which makes players imagine themselves as the power to awaken natural life in the game, reflecting the connotation of natural “symbiosis”. “Flying”, as the core mechanism, not only brings players a sense of freedom, but also makes players feel that they are integrated with nature, allowing players to have zero-distance contact with nature. When the player’s emotions are integrated with natural emotions, the player realizes that reviving nature is the mission of people in this game world. This is how Zen games bring players into a “flow” state - through their unique core mechanisms.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F8551572d-b56f-4a44-88b1-8539f10dba42.png/size/" alt="*Flower*"></p>
<p>Let’s look at <em>Unpacking</em>. Although its ideological connotation may not be so profound, you can still feel the role of its Zen core mechanism in the entire game. For most people, moving may be a very troublesome thing, but in the game, the developer made it a casual and decompressing game. Moving can have many connotations. It can be the pursuit of a desired goal, or it can be an escape from a past. No matter which one, they all mean that you will face a new stage in your life.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Fdb83e29c-d918-408f-a9e4-2c14699ab6ec.png/size/" alt="*Unpacking* Core Mechanism Design"></p>
<p>In the design of the core mechanism, the game selectively abandons the “packing” part and only shows the “unpacking” part. “Packing” means letting go and preparing for the next stage, while “unpacking” means introspection. When we open the sealed box and take out the items, we are actually decompressing our hearts. When we examine the items and consider their placement, we are actually examining ourselves, examining the past, and planning for the future. The game gradually brings players into a “flow” state with the core mechanism of “unpacking and placing” corresponding to the psychological process of “decompression and introspection”. The player’s emotions gradually merge with the emotions of the game protagonist. While immersed in the game experience, it also allows players to internalize some emotional experiences into their own growth through introspection. Zen games bring players a fresh emotional experience through creative core mechanism design. Such a mechanism itself is full of humanism, satisfying the emotional demands of players and allowing players to always be in a state of “flow”.</p>

<h3 id="Metaphorical-Narrative-Design-and-Emotional-Creation-in-Levels"><a href="#Metaphorical-Narrative-Design-and-Emotional-Creation-in-Levels" class="headerlink" title="Metaphorical Narrative Design and Emotional Creation in Levels"></a>Metaphorical Narrative Design and Emotional Creation in Levels</h3><p>The “Zen” style emphasizes “imagery”, which can be understood as the original concept of Chinese art aesthetics, fully integrating the dual levels of rational and perceptual understanding. Introducing the “Zen” style in the design of video games, making full use of the aesthetic symbols with “hint” functions in it, players can also get a more emotional deep aesthetic experience from it, stimulating each player’s exclusive emotions, and incorporating more deep connotations into the game.</p>
<p>In <em>Unpacking</em>, the game narrates through the design of metaphorical mechanisms. For example, the game introduces a new concept in the third stage – some items in the room cannot be moved, which forces players to negotiate their items with others and fill in the empty spaces. You will realize that the protagonist at this time is sharing a house with others, which can easily remind you of your life in a shared space when you were young. In the fourth stage, you can move the items already in the room at the beginning of the level, which represents a compromise in a romantic relationship. There are also specific placement rules that certain items must follow. These game mechanisms that are not explicitly expressed contain the “connotation” of each stage, symbolizing the protagonist’s growth stage and life trajectory. Local metaphors strengthen the overall emotional intensity of the game, making the game have deeper ideological depth and poetic connotation.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2F8300d4af-bd1f-491d-bcd7-f60d549c4260.png/size/" alt="Because of cohabitation, the proudest certificate has nowhere to be placed, and can only be hidden under the bed in the end."></p>
<p>If these implicit mechanisms have a strong emotional mapping and depict the character itself and the emotional interaction between the player and the character from a microscopic perspective. Then the level design brings players into a journey of emotional ups and downs from a macroscopic perspective. Players experience 7 changes in their life trajectory through 7 moves in the game, and at the same time feel the experience of each life stage in the level. The different details of the same item in each level and the different placement mechanisms perfectly imply the changes in different stages, thereby promoting the development of emotions, identifying with and resonating with the protagonist’s state of mind reflected in different details each time, and completing a journey of life.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220615%2Ffb7e65bf-f84e-444b-99ef-3f015f7c2f8c.png/size/" alt="The same item also undergoes different changes in the game with different levels."></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The experience that video games bring to players has become more diverse with the development of technology. It is no longer limited to the relatively primitive impulses such as survival or the desire for victory at the beginning. It is slowly evolving towards higher-level and more delicate emotional needs. People hope to create a spiritual pure land in the hustle and bustle of life, where they can release more emotions and liberate their minds.</p>
<p>Traditional games often attract players through wonderful plot settings or operating mechanisms full of a sense of accomplishment and excitement, bringing players emotional ups and downs. In Zen games, there is almost no specific plot and victory or defeat. The game touches players through the interactive experience created by the mechanism. The designer integrates his own life experience and values into the game mechanism, and promotes the emotional interaction between the player and the game world from a microscopic perspective. This is the aesthetic experience that Zen games bring to players.</p>

    <title>Disco Elysium: Unique Craftsmanship Needs Specialized Tools</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220616/28584_1024550.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Introduction-to-Disco-Elysium"><a href="#Introduction-to-Disco-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Disco Elysium"></a>Introduction to Disco Elysium</h2><p><em>Disco Elysium</em> is a role-playing game developed and published by ZA&#x2F;UM, a game studio from Estonia. It is also their first game. <em>Disco Elysium</em> won Best Role-Playing Game, Best Independent Game, Best Narrative, and Best New Independent Game Developer at TGA2019. The basic gameplay of this game is similar to the dice-rolling gameplay of DND (Dungeons &amp; Dragons), but the points required for successful judgment can be affected by skills, the Thought Cabinet system, and the plot. This game has a large amount of text and boldly abandons the combat part completely. The only bit of combat plot is also determined by plot choices. It can be said that this is a game where text is supreme.</p>
<p>Localization is a crucial part of the game’s dissemination. Especially for a role-playing game like <em>Disco Elysium</em>, which is similar to a visual novel, localization is indispensable.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Significance-and-Difficulties-of-Localization-for-Disco-Elysium"><a href="#1-The-Significance-and-Difficulties-of-Localization-for-Disco-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="1. The Significance and Difficulties of Localization for Disco Elysium"></a>1. The Significance and Difficulties of Localization for Disco Elysium</h2><p>In this game, almost all information is conveyed through text and voice. Players obtain information through text and interact with the game plot through text dialogue options. If players cannot understand the text, then this game is almost impossible to play. The original text of <em>Disco Elysium</em> is not only English, but also mixed with French, Spanish, and even Finnish dialects. Not only that, words from various fields such as astronomy, geography, politics, history, philosophy, and economics may even appear on the same page, including words created by the author. The original text is so “unfriendly” to non-native speakers that the members of the Chinese localization team “Whisper Studio” sighed “What is this?” when they first read the original text.</p>
<p>Therefore, localization is crucial to the dissemination and sales of <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Conversely, Chinese localization is indispensable for Chinese players to access <em>Disco Elysium</em>. However, it is obvious that the localization of this game is not an easy task. The localization staff is faced with not only the problems of multiple minority languages, mixed use of created words, but also the two major difficulties of a huge text volume of 1.3 million English words, a large number of obscure metaphors, and abstract sentences. The depth of its plot text can be seen from the first two scenes of the opening, and you can also see the puns and flexible combinations of self-made words in the text. It can be seen how arduous the localization work will be.</p>

<p>In an interview with the localization team “Whisper Studio”, they mentioned: “Starting from the official localization of the official version of the game in September 2019, we spent nearly 4 months completing the initial translation at the end of 2019. We spent another month localizing the updates and new texts. It is equivalent to completing the initial translation in December, and the internal test officially started in late January and early February.” As of August 28, 2020, the update announcement of <em>Disco Elysium</em> on this day mentioned that the text of the game is still being continuously revised, polished, and supplemented after its release. “According to the latest statistics, Disco Elysium has a total of about 1.3 million English words and 1.8 million Chinese characters.” At that time, it was only a year after the Chinese localization of <em>Disco Elysium</em> began. The localization team initially localized more than one million words in just 4 months, and it was the difficult-to-localize text as mentioned above. This is already a very rare thing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Communication-Between-the-Localization-Team-and-the-Developer-is-Indispensable"><a href="#2-Communication-Between-the-Localization-Team-and-the-Developer-is-Indispensable" class="headerlink" title="2. Communication Between the Localization Team and the Developer is Indispensable"></a>2. Communication Between the Localization Team and the Developer is Indispensable</h2><p>Nowadays, problems such as isolated translation and stiff transliteration in the localization of overseas games are common. There are many reasons for this, such as the game production team cannot allow localization personnel to fully understand the entire game or the scene of the text due to confidentiality and other reasons; or the game text is translated for the second time, and is not directly localized from the original text; or the game production team does not understand the market situation and finds an unprofessional and irresponsible localization team.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic game <em>The Witcher 3</em>, traveling merchants all became “female travelers”, merchants were all translated as “perfume merchants”, and the word “cat” was replaced with “cat’s eye” globally, and so on. A large number of such stiff and strange translations have added many difficulties for Chinese players to understand the game world, and are also likely to lead to misunderstandings of the plot, and also destroy the player’s immersion. It is also obvious that the localization team did not fully access the game content before translating.</p>
<p>For another example, recently, careful players have found that the localized text of multiple items in <em>Elden Ring</em> even has exaggerated, nonsensical, and deliberate use of rare words but incorrect use. For example, in the item description of the item “Death Prince’s Malignant Pustule”, the sentence “those who have concerns (from the Buddhist Heart Sutra, meaning: obstacles)” has no source at all in the Japanese version (it is suspected to be derived from the original text meaning “cannot die completely”), let alone whether the use of Buddhist terms here is in line with the atmosphere. Netizens speculate that this kind of translation is because the localization staff cannot access the entire game to understand the overall meaning, and they do not know how to localize this original text in isolation, so they deliberately mystify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220616%2F39d512c1-1e58-4f6d-95e5-92f6feb85733.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220616&#x2F;39d512c1-1e58-4f6d-95e5-92f6feb85733.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. The item “Death Prince’s Malignant Pustule” in “Elden Ring”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For <em>Disco Elysium</em>, the Chinese version was not released simultaneously with the game, but after the game was released, so the localization team was able to experience the specific scene of the text in the game. R, a member of the localization team, mentioned in the interview that “most of the people in the team played the game”.</p>
<p>Moreover, the localization team can also communicate with the original author about the text content to ensure the accuracy of difficult points.</p>
<p>R said a story in the interview: “We constantly understand the details in the process of work, and even help the original author to correct mistakes”…”For example, a Chinese text says ‘I am very tired of XX’, and it feels that something is not right when connected with the context. After repeated comparisons, we proposed to ZA&#x2F;UM: ‘Is it that tried was typed as tired here?’ They checked and found that it was indeed a typo.” It can be seen that it is indispensable for the localization team to communicate with the original author about the text content.</p>
<p>Not only that, ZA&#x2F;UM also observed the effect of the initial Chinese sample in the Chinese player community. Kaur Kender and Danis H, two executive producers of ZA&#x2F;UM, participated in the “Guangzhou Nuclear Fusion” game exhibition. They observed the performance of players playing the sample at their booth. They said “players really understood our game”: players would smile where there were humorous elements, and corresponding emotions would also be conveyed where there were dramatic conflicts, which shows that the translated text can indeed express the creative intention. The game company is responsible for its own works, and also observes and researches the effect of the translated samples. Such careful localization work is worthy of praise from players. It can also be seen that they do not simply want players to be able to read the game text, but pursue that players can understand the game connotation. This should be the effect that localization should pursue. Even if they are native speakers of different languages, they can also understand the same game connotation.</p>
<p>But with such a large amount of text, the Chinese localization of <em>Disco Elysium</em> still has a long way to go. Even now, after multiple patches, there are still errors. For example, in the figure below, “broke” is incorrectly translated as “broken”, and the correct translation should be “the billboard prevented the car from falling into the canal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220616%2F0d1547d0-71f5-4525-95bb-abe1acef055b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220616&#x2F;0d1547d0-71f5-4525-95bb-abe1acef055b.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-One-key-Language-Switching-Letting-Players-“Localize-Themselves”"><a href="#3-One-key-Language-Switching-Letting-Players-“Localize-Themselves”" class="headerlink" title="3. One-key Language Switching, Letting Players “Localize Themselves”"></a>3. One-key Language Switching, Letting Players “Localize Themselves”</h2><p>What makes <em>Disco Elysium</em> different is that it has made a very practical feature in terms of localization - one-key language switching, that is, players can specify two languages and a key on the keyboard, and pressing the key can quickly switch the language of the entire game between the two on the spot.</p>
<p>For people who cannot understand English, this function is almost meaningless, but if players have a certain English foundation, combined with today’s convenient word search software, players can independently understand some sentences that they feel they have not understood. On the one hand, this is a kind of compromise, that is, a compromise to the profound and difficult-to-localize text, allowing players to combine dictionaries to independently translate and understand some difficult points; but on the other hand, this greatly facilitates players to deeply understand the original meaning of the game. It is impossible to localize English, which is very different from Chinese, without information loss. This function allows players to read the original text to make up for the inevitable information loss in the localization process. For a game that takes text reading as almost all content, this function can be said to be a perfect fit.</p>
<p><em>Disco Elysium</em> needs this system very much. This game has a lot of hints and puns. For example, the original text of the first dialogue at the beginning has a sentence “no ex-wives contains in it” (see Figure 2). “ex-wives” is a homophone of “ex-wife”. This almost explicit pun, even if it is translated into “no old love”, players may not be able to associate it with “ex-wife”. I believe that players who have a certain foundation in English have played the first week. When they return to this first dialogue during replay, they use one-key language switching to view the original text. When they see these hints and puns, they will definitely be able to understand different content from them and get a new sense of novelty as if they were seeing this game for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="4-Careful-Production-Creates-a-Successful-“Disco-Elysium”"><a href="#4-Careful-Production-Creates-a-Successful-“Disco-Elysium”" class="headerlink" title="4. Careful Production Creates a Successful “Disco Elysium”"></a>4. Careful Production Creates a Successful “Disco Elysium”</h2><p>In general, <em>Disco Elysium</em> has become the closest one to a novel in the game, but it has the flexibility that novels cannot have, flexible and complex plot dialogues that change with choices, a unique Thought Cabinet system, and a smart one-key language switching function. In addition, players can also be immersed in the shocking soundtrack and beautiful pictures with tension when playing, as if they are Harry, immersed in the scene.</p>
<p>The production company ZA&#x2F;UM once dabbled in creating music, painting, publishing poetry and novel collections, but they all fell silent. But they combined them and created this <em>Disco Elysium</em>, which found a carrier for their thoughts that had been precipitated for many years. They boldly wrote the text obscurely and difficult to understand, boldly deleted the combat elements in the “DND” game mode, but flexibly added many interesting elements to increase the fun, and smartly added a one-key language switching system that increases the possibility of players interpreting the deep meaning of the game. They have well integrated all this, so that even we who are far away on the other side of the Eurasian continent can also happily immerse ourselves in it and play Harry Du Bois to explore the world of <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

    <title>&#39;He&#39;s a Good Guy Now, But Maybe Not Later&#39; - The Appeal of &#39;Social Deception&#39; Games During the Pandemic</title>
    <url>/2022/06/11/netease-ux-articles/news_20220616_28584_1024555/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220616/28584_1024555.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2017, the social deduction game <em>Werewolf</em>, based on the Werewolf culture, became one of the keywords of the game industry in the first half of 2017 due to its explosive development, and was even considered a new trend in the industry. Four or five years later, under the multiple impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, when <em>Werewolf</em> is mentioned again, it no longer has the excitement and glory of the past, or rather, it has “transformed” and appeared in the public eye in a new form.</p>
<p>In 2018, a social survival game called <em>Among Us</em> was released, but it received little attention until 2020 when it became popular due to many Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. In early 2022, following the popularity of <em>Among Us</em>, a game called <em>Dread Hunger</em>, or “Werewolf at Sea” as players call it, was launched on Steam. In the first week of its release, the number of online players of the game quickly soared from less than 3,000 to 12,000. Today, the number of online players of the game is still increasing. According to SteamDB data (data at 0:00 on May 1, 2022), the game ranks in the TOP 10 of the Steam popularity list.</p>
<p>As a cooperative survival game with a not-so-novel gameplay, incorporating elements of <em>Werewolf</em> that are not well-regarded today, why can it continue to attract players’ attention months after its release?</p>
<h2 id="1-Survival-RPG-in-Werewolf-Mode"><a href="#1-Survival-RPG-in-Werewolf-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Survival RPG in Werewolf Mode"></a>1. Survival RPG in Werewolf Mode</h2><p>“We’re almost through the passage. Storms are battering the keel and the crew are whispering of blood and dark magic.” - Captain’s Log, April 1847</p>
<p><em>Dread Hunger</em> is a multiplayer cooperative survival Werewolf-like game with the theme of social deception, survival in adversity, and escape and confrontation. The game is set in the snowy Canadian Arctic Circle. What comes into view in the game is the vast snowfield and rolling snow mountains. Players will play eight crew members with different identities on a 19th-century warship assigned by the British Royal Family, sailing through the cruel Arctic. Among them, two players will be “thralls” who will hinder other players.</p>
<p>The goal of victory is also very simple. First of all, players must ensure their own survival. The “good” side needs to get the ship out of trouble, while the “thralls” need to prevent it at all costs. Like common survival games, players need to eat, keep warm, and arm themselves. In addition, the ship needs fuel to move forward, so everyone needs to collect coal, and at the same time, the ship must avoid icebergs on the route.</p>
<p>For this game, “survival” and “Werewolf” are like the keel and sails of this ocean-going ship. “Survival” is the keel of the game, which determines whether the players can continue, and “Werewolf” is the sail, which determines where the ship goes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-It-What’s-Different"><a href="#2-Why-It-What’s-Different" class="headerlink" title="2. Why It? What’s Different?"></a>2. Why It? What’s Different?</h2><p>In fact, this gameplay is not the first of its kind in <em>Dread Hunger</em>. As early as 2019, <em>Project Winter</em> had a similar design. It was also a cold winter, also with 8 players, also with 2 “traitors”, and also all about “surviving”.</p>
<h3 id="Multiple-Character-Classes"><a href="#Multiple-Character-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Character Classes"></a>Multiple Character Classes</h3><p>On the gameplay mechanism of <em>Project Winter</em>, <em>Dread Hunger</em> adopts the multi-class setting of RPG. For example, players can play the roles of captain, chef, engineer, doctor, etc. Different roles also have different weapons and abilities. And some survival construction gameplay is retained, such as going to the wild to collect resources to build various props and items.</p>
<p>This kind of construction gameplay not only provides richer playability, but also deeply penetrates the two conditions for the game’s victory: survival and reaching the destination. The setting of multiple classes creates multiple dimensions for the player’s game experience: due to the different performance of various classes, in the middle of a game, each player can exert the characteristics of their class. Even if you are tired of one of them, there are others to choose from. For players, the rich diversity in the game process creates long-term playability.</p>
<h3 id="Each-Performing-Their-Duties-Direct-Confrontation"><a href="#Each-Performing-Their-Duties-Direct-Confrontation" class="headerlink" title="Each Performing Their Duties, Direct Confrontation"></a>Each Performing Their Duties, Direct Confrontation</h3><p>In addition, compared with games like <em>Among Us</em> that listen more to speeches, <em>Dread Hunger</em> completely abandons the meeting, taking turns to speak, and voting环节 (huán jié - sessions&#x2F;segments), and emphasizes direct confrontation between different camps. Being eloquent is not a necessary skill for the “thrall” camp, and the “good guys” do not have to organize language to “explain themselves”. Except for communicating necessary information with each other, players can focus on their own work, which greatly reduces the psychological burden between casual players and makes the game rhythm more refreshing. Through this mechanism, players can cooperate with each other and move towards the goal, or they can trust each other and eliminate the traitors.</p>
<h3 id="Operation-and-Strategy"><a href="#Operation-and-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Operation and Strategy"></a>Operation and Strategy</h3><p>The game also retains the fun of identities in traditional <em>Werewolf</em> from the mechanism setting. The ship, as the base camp of everyone, often gathers on the ship after nightfall in order to hand in supplies and avoid the severe cold. This has become a natural venue. Everyone exchanges information while doing their work: who might be a traitor, and the traitors will also be mixed in, spreading rumors and secretly sabotaging.</p>
<p>The game enters the later stage, and the game also changes from a scheming <em>Werewolf</em> to a positive asymmetrical confrontation. In order to develop better, the “thralls” will leave the main group and act alone, while the surviving good players also change from mutual suspicion to huddling together to resist the threat from the thralls and the weather. In a short game of more than 20 minutes, it includes the early game strategy, the mid-term suspicion, and the late-stage positive confrontation. With the changes in the weather and the development of the thralls, the pace of the battle is accelerating step by step, keeping the players’ nerves in a state of high tension.</p>
<p>The most important thing about the game is that it completely gives the choice to the players themselves. It tells you the ultimate goal of victory, but it will not deliberately guide players on what to do and what not to do. Players can give full play to their imagination to achieve the desired effect. As long as you can achieve the goal, the developer doesn’t care what happened in the middle, which also leads to the game’s operational ceiling being very high. Therefore, whether it is at the level of strategic gaming or in operational details, there is a lot of room for learning and improvement. So it is not difficult to understand why everyone is happy to continue playing.</p>
<h2 id="3-Social-Deception-Carnival-Under-the-Pandemic"><a href="#3-Social-Deception-Carnival-Under-the-Pandemic" class="headerlink" title="3. Social Deception Carnival Under the Pandemic"></a>3. Social Deception Carnival Under the Pandemic</h2><p>Under the pandemic, in addition to satisfying the sociality between friends, the game has also released the “little devil” deep in the player’s soul.</p>
<p>For such games, the core attraction is never the rule-based competition of other games, let alone the competition of reaction and operation. The fun is often dependent on details, the player’s observation, or various subtle clues are crucial. The reasoning process is also full of drama, and the surprise and sting that erupts the moment the mystery is revealed, the pleasure brought by acting in the dark corner under the eyes of everyone, all this together creates the fun of deception and the joy of cooperation, which is what this type of game ultimately brings us. The game seems to be saying to the player: Hey, it’s safe now, why not give it a try? The most important thing is that this “dark” impulse is currently only in the game and will not have any serious impact on real life.</p>
<p>The game’s own mechanism has also created a strong sociality. This new online social “Werewolf” has broken through the restrictions of the pandemic. Players are forced to communicate, cooperate, or compete with each other, neutralizing a certain degree of isolation in the pandemic environment. There are now many games with social interaction or interpersonal relationships as the theme, but the gameplay is often single and lacks stamina. At least for now, <em>Dread Hunger</em> does not have this concern.</p>
<p>For players, deceiving each other among friends is the real entry into the game. The questioning and lies of close friends face to face create multi-layered fear and excitement. Imagine a backstab from a friend, suspicion in a treacherous environment, or being wronged. Finally, the game is over, and back in real life, everything returns to normal. You will still continue to trust him&#x2F;her. After all, you are friends, how could he&#x2F;she possibly lie to you?</p>

<p>What is gamification? Generally speaking, gamification is a method of enriching educational content and marketing or business processes through game mechanics. Gamification design is a powerful tool to enhance user engagement and transform products from function-centered design to human-centered design. For example, gamification in education can significantly improve learner engagement and knowledge retention, and help users complete tedious tasks or training. Gamification is also incorporated into some marketing strategies to attract customers and inspire loyalty.</p>
<p>In interaction design, gamification can motivate users to perform expected actions and provide a meaningful user experience. Inserting interesting features such as leaderboards and badges into existing systems will also stimulate users’ intrinsic motivation and drive user participation.</p>
<p>Gamification is not about turning the user interface into a game. Instead, it injects fun elements into applications and systems, motivating users by introducing gamification into existing systems. There are many ways to gamify a system, such as countdowns and encouraging completed tasks, etc. People like to interact with the system and satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Dynamic-Model-of-Games"><a href="#1-The-Dynamic-Model-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Dynamic Model of Games"></a>1. The Dynamic Model of Games</h2><p>In the player motivation model collated by Quantic Foundry, the pleasure brought by action, social behavior, the challenge and practice of thinking, creativity, the immersion of the virtual world, and the experience of achievement have become the main motivations of current game players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Ff1f82a54-cbba-4a77-9dac-25c560510204.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;f1f82a54-cbba-4a77-9dac-25c560510204.png"></p>
<h3 id="Action-and-Social"><a href="#Action-and-Social" class="headerlink" title="Action and Social"></a>Action and Social</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F76597a31-da80-4848-b8f7-c910ce383793.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;76597a31-da80-4848-b8f7-c910ce383793.png"></p>
<p>The needs related to action and social interaction are based on immediacy and adrenaline surges. People who score high on these motivations are more likely to want a sense of excitement (commonly known as “thrill”), such as instant destructive behavior, social interaction with other players, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F42eed41b-b64b-48a7-8ac2-9ae297c89d13.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;42eed41b-b64b-48a7-8ac2-9ae297c89d13.png"></p>

<p>This item addresses the user’s need for progress, skill development, and overcoming challenges. Some players want to acquire more powerful skills and deeper thinking, which gives rise to this type of game that requires players to be calmer and spend a longer time playing. It seeks progressive and cumulative mechanics. <em>StarCraft</em> is a series of games that require more strategy and high cognitive load.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Ff00c35f5-710b-4031-b7a8-155247b1620c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;f00c35f5-710b-4031-b7a8-155247b1620c.png"></p>
<p><em>Players gain better results in StarCraft through training and accumulating experience</em></p>
<h3 id="Creation-and-Immersion"><a href="#Creation-and-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Creation and Immersion"></a>Creation and Immersion</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F559bebc3-c4e0-4764-b9ef-25065cb046e3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;559bebc3-c4e0-4764-b9ef-25065cb046e3.png"></p>
<p>This item involves providing users with a platform that promotes exploration and creative expression. Users can try new options or combinations at any time and create unique content, and see the results of their creativity, receive instant feedback, and be rewarded for it. Users who value this point will seek a broad and expressive style of play, they are curious and always testing the boundaries of the game. A deeper sense of immersion can be created through a profound and sophisticated game style and a complete story narrative. Personalized design and providing a sufficiently open world and gameplay can also meet the user’s creative needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fe1441a65-97b0-47ea-b412-4eb3b649cb5e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;e1441a65-97b0-47ea-b412-4eb3b649cb5e.png"></p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Personalized Face Customization Interface</em></p>
<p>From the dynamic model of the game itself, we can gain insight into the three main needs of modern people in the game. By grasping such needs, we can help the user experience design of the product have a more systematic thinking and a more complete dynamic mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="2-Design-Principles-of-Gamification"><a href="#2-Design-Principles-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="2. Design Principles of Gamification"></a>2. Design Principles of Gamification</h2><p>The basic gamification elements are: points, levels, tasks, leaderboards, badges, progress bars, avatars, teammates, etc. The design principles of gamification come from the relevant mechanisms of the game itself, including five basic mechanisms and two design principles, through which the playability of the game is guaranteed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Goals:</strong> The game must have clear overall goals: Why are you here? What is the point of the mission? Therefore, when users achieve them, they will feel a sense of accomplishment when they win, which is a basic game element to enjoy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> There is no game without rules. The most effective rules are usually easy to understand and execute, requiring little or no learning from the user. From a user experience perspective, rules will determine the various touchpoints in the user’s journey.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback is the basis of every interactive system. Users want to see their progress and how they can improve. Feedback can be displayed in the form of progress bars, new levels, encouraging messages, greetings at each level, or animations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> Users have invested time and effort according to the rules of the game, so the game needs to provide some rewards! Rewards can be virtual badges, points, trophies, coins, leaderboards, stickers, avatars, or cash, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> User engagement is at the heart of any design philosophy. To inspire this engagement, designers must be aware of two types of motivation – intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from curiosity, pride, or a sense of accomplishment. Extrinsic motivation comes from tangible things we want to achieve, such as money, good grades, or praise. In mobile applications that prioritize engagement, intrinsic motivation is much stronger. The sense of pleasure that users experience after winning something is considered the ultimate intrinsic motivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Choice:</strong> When users voluntarily participate and abide by the rules to achieve their goals, the system&#x2F;product will be interesting to them. But when they are forced to do so, the fun is greatly reduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Failure:</strong> As long as users can fail without fear of punishment, the possibility of failure brings a sense of excitement, which will keep players coming back to try again. Therefore, we can find a way to inject enough risk to ensure that users stay engaged but not frustrated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the design principles of gamification, we can better analyze how games and applications design functional mechanisms and the visual specifications of interactive interfaces according to user psychology.</p>
<p>Next comes the application link. We will explore the application of gamification mechanisms in product experience through specific examples of games and Internet products.</p>
<h2 id="3-Commonly-Used-Gamification-Designs"><a href="#3-Commonly-Used-Gamification-Designs" class="headerlink" title="3. Commonly Used Gamification Designs"></a>3. Commonly Used Gamification Designs</h2><p>Starting from the different elements of the game, there are the following commonly used gamification designs:</p>
<h3 id="Badges-and-Stickers"><a href="#Badges-and-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="Badges and Stickers"></a>Badges and Stickers</h3><p>Combine badges and stickers to reward users for completing set challenges or collecting points. Small rewards can not only give users positive feedback and enhance their enthusiasm, but also give users a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fe1ede754-5028-43a2-a43f-bb356044b491.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;e1ede754-5028-43a2-a43f-bb356044b491.png"></p>
<p><em>Personalized Avatar Collection in the Game</em></p>
<p>In the design of the game <em>Onmyoji</em>, users can unlock multiple avatar frames through activity achievements, satisfying personalization while giving users a further sense of accomplishment, and can also play a function of showing identity in social interaction within the game.</p>
<p>In the gamification of products, we can also see a variety of user avatar frames, or personalized input method skins. The game elements of badges and stickers not only fundamentally satisfy users’ enthusiasm for stamp collecting, but are also an important part of showing personal identity. Taking the language learning software Duolingo as an example, reaching new levels, spending lingots, and following friends can all earn related user badges, promoting user participation in a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F1812df73-5c6e-4c2a-b840-7c75e9b21809.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;1812df73-5c6e-4c2a-b840-7c75e9b21809.png"></p>
<p><em>Duolingo App Badge Design</em></p>
<h3 id="Leaderboards"><a href="#Leaderboards" class="headerlink" title="Leaderboards"></a>Leaderboards</h3><p>It is a huge incentive for players to see their names on the leaderboard. After all, it is human nature to desire some healthy competition to win some sweet rewards. However, designers must be careful when applying this game element. Leaderboards can have a negative impact on some users: they may feel frustrated when the competition is fierce.</p>
<p>Specifically, the system prompt when failing can use “try again” to imply that players reduce their worries about punishment and provide positive psychological guidance. The ranking display is also more gentle with the text information “top n%”. At the same time, the interaction design does not overemphasize failure. The contrast in the interaction design between the winning and losing sides is small. Compared with punishment, it focuses more on highlighting the progress of individual growth levels, which can give the losing party less frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fe678e55b-5ea1-4998-9424-93212526f097.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;e678e55b-5ea1-4998-9424-93212526f097.png"></p>
<p><em>Ubiquitous Leaderboards in Games</em></p>
<p>In the efficiency tool product Forest, users can be motivated by seeing their concentration time ranking among friends. This design is also used in WeChat Sports to mobilize users’ enthusiasm. At the same time, users can also set not to display their rankings, avoiding a lot of embarrassment. From the interaction with friends, the enthusiasm of users is mobilized through social needs, and the initiative is generated from the comparison with users in the entire platform. Leaderboards are elements that can well stimulate user motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F01874ff2-52d0-4fa7-956d-10f33e537cf0.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;01874ff2-52d0-4fa7-956d-10f33e537cf0.png"></p>
<p><em>Leaderboard Design in Applications</em></p>
<h3 id="Challenges"><a href="#Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Challenges"></a>Challenges</h3><p>From daily task check-ins, ranked match upgrades to various dungeon challenges, this gamification technique turns boring tasks into exciting activities. Challenges can push users out of their comfort zone and allow them to reach new heights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F94eeca65-1569-4db8-a35b-49c43eb6f04b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;94eeca65-1569-4db8-a35b-49c43eb6f04b.png"></p>
<p><em>《Revelation M》 Task Illustration</em></p>
<p>This technique is also often applied to various learning products, maintaining user retention by setting various task challenges. In the popular word memorization software, the number of words that can be memorized is used as a reward prop. Through continuous check-in as a challenge for users to obtain rewards, and check-in stamping as a random reward, it fully mobilizes users’ motivation to pursue rewards and their expectation of random surprises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F0b612f57-8e62-43ad-b996-fc5e970c311e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;0b612f57-8e62-43ad-b996-fc5e970c311e.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fc9ac6a36-f9d8-4be7-a276-7abc225ee039.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;c9ac6a36-f9d8-4be7-a276-7abc225ee039.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Continuous Check-in Rewards for Word Memorization Software</em></p>
<h3 id="Points"><a href="#Points" class="headerlink" title="Points"></a>Points</h3><p>Many games use a points system to measure the success of players in conquering challenges to motivate them to complete specific tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F92957467-1a53-4756-8709-d5bcae1c5c26.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;92957467-1a53-4756-8709-d5bcae1c5c26.png"></p>
<p><em>Obtaining Points Through Operations in the Game</em></p>
<p>In the ballroom game of <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, the dance score of two players is calculated by averaging the scores of the two players. While motivating players to hit more full combos, it also cultivates the tacit understanding and friendship between players, and at the same time satisfies the user’s motivational needs for challenge and making friends.</p>
<p>The game mechanism of points is also often used in Internet applications, such as language learning, productivity, time management, task managers, and education. For example, Starbucks’ “Star Rewards” mechanism transforms the consumption process into a journey of “becoming a Gold Star member” - users become higher-level members by consuming and accumulating stars, giving the traditional consumption behavior more meaning of “gain”, and giving the “star collection” a romanticized experience with an integrated brand art image. Similarly, takeaway software such as Ele.me and Meituan give feedback and redeem red envelopes based on consumption volume, which also diverts users’ attention and improves user experience with gentle gamification design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F245a559b-64d7-4f9e-a7bd-71a0a8fa740c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;245a559b-64d7-4f9e-a7bd-71a0a8fa740c.png"></p>
<p><em>Obtaining Points Through Operations in the Game</em></p>
<h3 id="Journey"><a href="#Journey" class="headerlink" title="Journey"></a>Journey</h3><p>This game mechanism makes people feel like real players in the adventure. In product design, designers can apply a branched approach, introducing new features as users gain experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2F01d3c624-8fd3-433b-8bd9-b005816e311a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;01d3c624-8fd3-433b-8bd9-b005816e311a.png"></p>
<p><em>New journeys unlocked according to level&#x2F;task can make players more involved in the growth of the game</em></p>
<p>In Alipay’s “Ant Forest”, sustainable environmental tasks give users a sense of mission when playing games. At the same time, the types of trees and map chapters that are continuously unlocked according to the accumulation of user experience ensure the motivation for users to continue to participate. In the experience process, there will also be a series of branch line unlocking linkages such as Ant Manor, Baba Farm, and Protected Area Patrol, which ensures the user’s turnover and retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fcb1da2b9-985c-4970-b93c-c7052aef9455.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;cb1da2b9-985c-4970-b93c-c7052aef9455.png"></p>

<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》’s Dark Tide Mode sets a limited time range and number of revives</em></p>
<p>Constraints, restrictions, and deadlines don’t sound fun, however, adding a countdown or life limit, allowing users to complete a task within a given time or with limited life energy, can increase people’s excitement and stimulate productivity. With the dynamic effects of the game interface and sound prompts, it can further promote the player’s tension and improve the level of concentration. Such constraints are also often used in promotional activities of shopping software and personalized functions of memory software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220617%2Fba7cb106-74a7-4060-8d31-291678af386b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220617&#x2F;ba7cb106-74a7-4060-8d31-291678af386b.png"></p>
<p><em>Shopping software activates users’ excitement and stickiness by limiting the number of times and time limit for red envelope collection</em></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Gamification design not only comes from the various mechanisms of the game, but also an experience design born based on the deep logic of user psychology and experience. Based on the common ideas and principles of gamification design, we can better improve the product service experience, use game ideas to drive users’ enthusiasm and participation, and can also use this to create more new and fun functional modules.</p>

    <title>How to Make Players Become a &quot;Good Father&quot; in Games?</title>
    <url>/2022/06/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20220621_28584_1025282/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220621/28584_1025282.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players are often asked to play other roles in games, and these roles may be far from our real life, such as a stern “old father.” Those classic father figures on the screen seem to be questioning us: Why, even if we don’t have relevant life experience, can we still immerse ourselves in the role of the “old father” in the game?</p>
<h2 id="1-Becoming-a-“Good-Father”-in-the-Game"><a href="#1-Becoming-a-“Good-Father”-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="1. Becoming a “Good Father” in the Game?"></a>1. Becoming a “Good Father” in the Game?</h2><p>20 years ago, when I was receiving corporal punishment from my dad, I probably wouldn’t have thought that many years later, I would be playing a stern old father in a game, worrying about how to get along with my rebellious son.</p>
<p>The father-son relationship has always been a relatively unfamiliar topic to me. When I was in college, I basically maintained a one-sentence-per-month, three-words-per-sentence relationship with my dad. The impact of this kind of father-son relationship on me is that since I started playing games, I have been strongly skeptical about whether I can empathize with the “father” role in the game. After all, for most gamers, a generally accepted truth is:</p>
<p>Empathy often comes from each person’s differentiated life experience. We are more likely to resonate with plots that are similar to our experiences, and it is difficult to empathize with characters with different personalities.</p>
<p>However, this view gradually became less convincing as some players came into contact with more and more games with fathers as the protagonists. In fact, whether it is Kratos in the new <em>God of War</em> or Joel in <em>The Last of Us</em>, I can feel the strong sense of immersion brought to me by the game characters - I hope Atreus will not follow the same path as “me” and become a revenge machine; I also don’t want Ellie to be taken away for research and become the dawn of sacrificing herself to save mankind. These emotional fluctuations seem to imply to me: You have become a “good father” in the game, whether I really have a child or am a homebody gamer who never leaves home.</p>

<p>In the DLC “A Father’s Promise” of <em>This War of Mine</em>, the father “Adam” played by the player did his best but failed to save his daughter, bringing sadness and tears to countless players. Even if none of us players may have experienced war, and few players really have a lovely daughter, these do not affect the player’s empathy and immersion with “Adam”.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fd5d68921-822a-40ed-bac3-fa6e816ed78d.png/size/" alt="This War of Mine"><br><em>Steam comments from players of the DLC “A Father’s Promise” of This War of Mine</em></p>
<p>I believe that players’ immersion in the “father” role is not grandstanding on social platforms or game comments. So we can’t help but wonder, what is the magic of these video games with “fathers” as the protagonists, that can make some players who have no relevant life experience become a qualified “good father”? This article will interpret this issue from three aspects: character image, gameplay, and narrative.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-Projection-of-the-Ideal-Father"><a href="#2-A-Projection-of-the-Ideal-Father" class="headerlink" title="2. A Projection of the Ideal Father?"></a>2. A Projection of the Ideal Father?</h2><p>The first aspect of creating a strong sense of immersion is to create a character setting that meets the player’s psychological expectations. The game character controlled by the player is the main medium for the player to interact with the game. In the virtual world, they are the player’s avatar and spokesperson. The first success of many games is that the father image in the game perfectly matches the player’s imagination, or projection, of the ideal father image.</p>
<p>Projection is a concept in psychology, which roughly means that individuals will subconsciously reflect their own thoughts, emotions, feelings, and cognition on others or external things. In games, the protagonist often becomes the object of our projection. We will project our understanding of the role and behavior of this character in life onto the identity and behavior of the character in the game. Images that conform to the projection are more likely to make players empathize and understand, while images that do not conform to the projection will blur the identity of the character and even create a sense of incongruity.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we can better understand why fathers in games tend to be taciturn, tall and majestic, fatherly love is like a mountain, because this represents the image of the ideal father in the hearts of most players - not that they want to have such a father, but that they think fathers should be like this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are far more than just old father images of fathers in reality, but if there is such a game where players need to play a meticulous, powerless old dad, I believe the sense of immersion will not be very good. In many cases, we don’t even need to go that far. As long as there are some atypical fathers, it is enough to make us question the character image in the game. For example, Ethan in <em>Resident Evil: Village</em>, apart from his love for his daughter, Ethan does not show much of the side of being an old father, so that many times I would think, even if Ethan is replaced by Mia (Ethan’s wife), the feeling the game brings to me does not seem to change much, especially in recent years when there are more and more female protagonists. If the father in the game is not “typical” enough, then this “neutral” parental image does not necessarily need to be undertaken by the father. You can replace him with any family member, it can be a mother, or a brother or sister.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F0cbcc05c-a701-4a67-ade4-05c25f2f9e48.png/size/" alt="Plague Tale: Innocence"><br><em>In Plague Tale: Innocence, the older sister is the representative of the family image</em></p>
<h2 id="3-Gameplay-that-Better-Matches-the-Behavior-of-the-Father-Character"><a href="#3-Gameplay-that-Better-Matches-the-Behavior-of-the-Father-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Gameplay that Better Matches the Behavior of the Father Character"></a>3. Gameplay that Better Matches the Behavior of the Father Character</h2><p>The behavior of a character is largely reflected in the specific gameplay of the game, and players often have their own expectations for the behavior of a character. If the gameplay does not match the character image and personality, it will be difficult for players to immerse themselves in the game image.</p>
<p>The reason why switching the gender of the protagonist in <em>Resident Evil</em> is relatively less incongruous for some players is largely because they are already used to operating female characters to struggle for survival in zombies. There are enough female protagonists in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. But if the player is asked to play a feminized Kratos, Kratos, no, “Krat-Mom” stretches out her arms and tears the monster in half like tearing a chicken, I believe the sense of incongruity has already exploded. This sense of incongruity may not be brought about by the image. Even if we design Krat-Mom into the classic mother image, gentle and amiable, understanding, tearing monsters by hand will still make us instantly detach from the role. The source of this sense of incongruity is actually that the game did not achieve such a content very well, that is: the matching of character image and gameplay.</p>
<p>Let’s make another assumption. If Krat-Mom doesn’t fight by tearing chickens by hand, but takes out a staff and releases cool magic, it seems much more reasonable.</p>
<p>If the new <em>God of War</em> was all about puzzles and no longer had combat elements, it wouldn’t matter whether Kratos was a Krat-Mom - puzzle, leisure and other gameplay generally do not have a particularly obvious character tendency. These neutral gameplays generally do not encounter the problem of matching gameplay and characters, but some gameplays will have relatively strong character implications: such as bloody action gameplay, parenting, war, military simulation, and so on.</p>
<p>From a macro perspective, games with fathers as the protagonists are more suitable for action, FPS and other combat-oriented gameplays. These gameplays that focus on strength will be more in line with our expectations of character behavior. Conversely, gameplay focused on parenting and leisure is often not found in games that emphasize the father-son or father-daughter relationship. Because many times, sweeping the floor, cooking, washing clothes and mopping the floor are often not in line with most players’ expectations of their father’s behavior. This is why we often play action games with dads, but not moms.</p>
<p>From the perspective of more detailed gameplay design, the interaction between father and son can also often increase the player’s sense of immersion as a father. For example, in <em>God of War</em>, players can call Atreus to shoot arrows, or let Atreus be a puzzle-solving tool. In these simple gameplay designs, players can also feel the unquestionable, cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside father-son relationship between Kratos and his son.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F15140c63-f372-43e3-adbf-72e6cc7bf7fe.png/size/" alt="God of War"><br><em>In the game, you can use specific keys to command Atreus to shoot arrows</em></p>
<h2 id="4-Empathy-Brought-by-Delicate-Emotional-Narrative"><a href="#4-Empathy-Brought-by-Delicate-Emotional-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="4. Empathy Brought by Delicate Emotional Narrative"></a>4. Empathy Brought by Delicate Emotional Narrative</h2><p>Good game narrative is crucial, otherwise even if the character image conforms to the player’s projection and the gameplay perfectly matches the character, what we may be playing is an enhanced version of <em>Contra</em>. To this day, some players still lack a sufficient impression of the characters in <em>Contra</em>. They don’t know who “I” am, where “I” came from, or why “I” killed so many strange enemies. What <em>Contra</em> lacks, in fact, is: empathy between the player and the character.</p>
<p>From the perspective of pure plot production, empathy is not particularly difficult. There are causes and consequences in script creation, and creators can have ample space and ink to foreshadow a character so that the character’s behavior is logical. But in games, it is often difficult for us to make players have a strong sense of empathy, because game narrative is often limited by the design and volume of the game itself (unless it is a text adventure game).</p>
<p>If some inherent logic in the plot cannot be expressed in the game through delicate narrative and effective design, the audience will be detached from the character and feel that “he is not me, because I don’t know why he does this.”</p>
<p>The first DLC “Legacy of the First Blade” of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> is actually a relatively typical negative example. The protagonist played by the player will quickly experience a series of “turbulent” plots such as meeting NPCs, marrying NPCs, having children, and then having their family destroyed and sending their children away in less than 10 hours of plot. The plot content does not match the story rhythm. Marriage and childbirth itself is a major event in a character’s life, but there is no foreshadowing, and the character does not have enough inner monologue to support a series of behavioral logic. This series of narrative problems makes players feel as if they are operating a completely unrelated character, and the DLC with the lowest score in history was born.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F816abffd-fdd8-4b25-97b9-78b35401eb7f.png/size/" alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey"><br><em>In the DLC, the character played by the player will conceive new life. This segment, which should have evoked strong empathy, has been criticized by players.</em></p>
<p>In terms of game narrative to make players empathize, <em>God of War</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em> do much better. In explaining the changes in the father-son (father-daughter) relationship, they use a slow pace to tell a not very complicated emotional entanglement, which is enough for players. Of course, this does not mean that there are no narrative problems at all. For example, from my personal experience, the source of the father-son conflict in <em>God of War</em> comes from the foreshadowing of the previous work (Kratos himself is a god, but his son does not know). Without playing the first three parts, it is actually difficult for players to understand the畸形 (jī xíng - abnormal, deformed) father-son relationship between them in the early stage. Fortunately, Kratos opens up to Atreus in the middle of the game, which also makes players understand the cause and effect of Kratos’ behavior logic.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Back to our original question: how do video games make players become “good fathers”? It requires the guidance of character image, gameplay, and narrative. Although most players agree that the player’s sense of immersion comes from each person’s differentiated life experience, this is not a false proposition, but it is also not a necessary condition for players to have a sense of immersion.</p>
<p>If the game can shape its character image that conforms to the player’s projection, build relevant gameplay that matches the character, and design a game narrative with smooth internal logic, it is not an impossible task for a player who has never been a father to become a qualified father in the game.</p>
<p>Games, as the ninth art, come from life and give back to life. Our thoughts, sights, and ideas in life are projected onto our game characters, and the plots we experience through game characters will become catalysts for us to understand the world and our families. Countless players commented under the <em>God of War</em> game that Kratos’ story reminded them of their own fathers, and I am one of them. After finishing <em>God of War</em>, I called my dad after a long time. My dad hadn’t received my call for a long time and was slightly flustered, very worried that I was sick or encountered some problems. I suddenly realized that fathers are probably the same. They may not be as powerful as Kratos, but they will definitely love you like Kratos, silently but powerfully.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F8cdb2ba6-0627-4a32-b74b-6df7b5cef964.png/size/" alt="Reddit"></p>
<p>Player comment in the God of War section of Reddit: I don’t usually post things like this, but I have to do it in the face of this game. If the game is out of 10, I would rate it 11. I have a deep understanding of this story because my mother recently passed away, leaving only me and my father whom I have never been close to. Thank you, God of War.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to dedicate this article to all the fathers in the world and wish them a happy Father’s Day. The prose poems written by fathers are still circulating, don’t let them dissipate in the wind.</p>

    <title>Helping Chinese Games Ride the Wave of Globalization - An Analysis of the Localization Practice of *Naraka: Bladepoint*</title>
    <url>/2022/06/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20220621_28584_1025296/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220621/28584_1025296.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game design itself exists to realize people’s dreams. In games, people can get a highly realistic experience of flying a plane to defend their homeland, or play famous figures to interpret the joys and sorrows of different destinies. This characteristic of the game destined it to be a global product from the day it was born. Language is just an obstacle to the realization of dreams in games.</p>
<p>Today, with globalization and highly developed technology, almost all game products cannot be satisfied with the success of a single market. How to acquire more players and occupy more game markets in more countries is a question that all game manufacturers must consider.</p>
<p>This article will take <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example to explore the choices and challenges faced by Chinese games in the process of going global and localization, to help more Chinese games ride the wave in the global game market.</p>
<h2 id="1-Language-Selection-Localization-VS-Internationalization"><a href="#1-Language-Selection-Localization-VS-Internationalization" class="headerlink" title="1. Language Selection: Localization VS Internationalization"></a>1. Language Selection: Localization VS Internationalization</h2><p>Internationalization refers to the modification or porting of a product or service so that it obtains the widest acceptance in different language countries and regions around the world. In practice, English is generally used as the internationalization language, and corresponding universal symbols are used.</p>
<p>Localization refers to the modification or porting of a product or service to make it more suitable for the needs of audiences in a specific language or country. In practice, the most frequently selected languages are Spanish, German, French, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Korean, Russian, and Polish. At the same time, Indonesian, Thai, Hindi, and Vietnamese are also rapidly gaining popularity. Given the growth prospects of the game market in South Asia and the Pacific region, it is expected that these languages will become popular languages in the next few years.</p>
<p>Obviously, localization is a higher stage of development of internationalization. If a game wants to achieve greater success worldwide, localization is a must.</p>
<p>NetEase’s 24 Entertainment’s <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> shoulders the important task of promoting traditional Chinese culture. From the beginning of its launch, it chose the path of global localization, hoping to provide players around the world with the ultimate user experience. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> launched its global open beta on August 12, 2021. Initially, 11 language versions were launched simultaneously for players around the world, and then Vietnamese and Thai versions were added. At the same time, it has Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean voiceovers, covering game players in more than 200 countries and regions around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F521e00e7-d269-4d97-a7d3-b341ea97ccf3.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;521e00e7-d269-4d97-a7d3-b341ea97ccf3.jpg"></p>
<p>When choosing the localization language, the first factor considered by <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> was which countries&#x2F;regions would be most popular for a Chinese-style martial arts multiplayer competitive game. Obviously, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s unique gameplay is widely popular around the world. The weapon system that combines melee + ranged weapons, the unique grappling hook design, and the unique hero skills, coupled with the blessing of Chinese martial arts elements, make it stand out among many games of the same type.</p>
<p>Secondly, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> needs to consider how to enter the world’s mainstream game market and acquire a wider game audience. Therefore, countries and regions that rank among the top in global game revenue are taken into consideration. According to Newzoo data, the top ten countries and regions in global game revenue in 2021 are: China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Brazil. This ranking has been very stable. Therefore, similar to the localization choices of many Western companies, 24 Entertainment chose French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, as well as Japanese and Korean, as the localization languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F0d8d2d61-4890-4133-b877-59df5644d31f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;0d8d2d61-4890-4133-b877-59df5644d31f.png"></p>
<p>In addition, Traditional Chinese (used in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, China) is also worth considering, because game players in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, China have high purchasing power: Taiwan, China ranks 16th and Hong Kong, China ranks 20th in the list of countries and regions with global game revenue.</p>
<p>Third, as a computer game, the main purchase channels for <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are the official website, Steam, and Epic. As one of the world’s largest comprehensive digital distribution platforms, the five most popular languages on Steam other than English are Simplified Chinese, Russian, Spanish, German, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the more popular the language and market, the more intense the market competition. The US market is known for being difficult to penetrate; while the Japanese market is lucrative, it is not the best target market in terms of specific game graphics or types. Therefore, while focusing on mature markets, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also focuses on emerging markets with huge development potential, such as: Thailand, Vietnam, and Turkey. These markets lack games in their native language and have less competition, so it is easier to achieve success.</p>
<h2 id="2-Narrative-Brushstrokes-Sinicization-VS-Westernization"><a href="#2-Narrative-Brushstrokes-Sinicization-VS-Westernization" class="headerlink" title="2. Narrative Brushstrokes: Sinicization VS Westernization"></a>2. Narrative Brushstrokes: Sinicization VS Westernization</h2><p>As an action-adventure multiplayer competitive game, the text in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is mainly divided into two categories: one is related to the setting of the game’s worldview and character background stories, and the other is related to the setting of the game’s gameplay itself. Its overall narrative style is a typical oriental style, including a large number of Chinese elements, such as: Longmen Grottoes, Bruce Lee, nunchucks, Sunwing, koi, dragon boat racing, zongzi, etc.</p>
<p>In the choice of game narrative style, the first thing is to ensure that players correctly understand the gameplay of the game, to ensure that they can quickly get started and have an immersive experience of the oriental martial arts style. Therefore, most of the texts related to the gameplay of the game adopt a straightforward narrative style.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that the correct cultural symbols are conveyed. The spread of culture is a subtle process. The clothing, weapons, props, and event settings in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> all reveal a mysterious oriental charm.</p>
<p>For cultural symbols that are well-known and accepted worldwide, the established expressions are generally used. For example: Bruce Lee, the Longmen Grottoes. On the one hand, these mature cultural symbols can help the game attract more potential players, and on the other hand, they promote the further spread of Chinese culture among the existing players of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F7f0b357b-91ed-462e-84b8-68b53a1298d7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;7f0b357b-91ed-462e-84b8-68b53a1298d7.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F634bcdae-54df-498f-a5aa-615b31847954.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;634bcdae-54df-498f-a5aa-615b31847954.png"></p>
<p>However, for cultural symbols that are relatively less well-known and accepted, and have no fixed expression, the method of free translation is adopted, careful consideration and repeated deliberation are made, and efforts are made to express the cultural meaning behind the text while increasing the understandability and acceptability of the text.</p>
<p>For example: <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has carried out a series of development plans called “Sunwing” based on the traditional cultural symbol “Golden Crow” (金乌 - Jīn Wū). The Golden Crow is a Chinese cultural symbol with an origin concept, originating from the sun bird of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. It is a symbol of Chinese cultural heritage. In the game, the Golden Crow is also the god of Naraka: Bladepoint. The development plan of “Sunwing” shows that 24 Entertainment will systematically and continuously carry out the inheritance of Chinese culture in the name of the Golden Crow. In this regard, the Thunder Fire UX global localization team carefully considered and chose “Sunwing Relics” as the translation of “金乌纪” (Jīn Wū Jì). “Sunwing” reflects the origin of the Golden Crow as the sun bird, perfectly matching the image of the “Golden Crow” in the game, and “Relics” reveals the connotation of the “Sunwing” project to inherit traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fe2c68e8e-f781-419b-9d19-a3b69edf9e52.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;e2c68e8e-f781-419b-9d19-a3b69edf9e52.png"></p>
<p>Third, the localization narrative of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> must ensure the readability and spreadability of the game text. For the oriental style worldview and character background story settings in the game, a set of parallel and corresponding Westernized worldview and character backgrounds have been constructed separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F37687f88-9ee0-4d19-9bfe-8a7a7ab28cbf.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;37687f88-9ee0-4d19-9bfe-8a7a7ab28cbf.png"></p>
<p>The concise and straightforward narrative style of the gameplay is to ensure that players quickly understand the game and ensure the basic game needs of players; the Sinicized narrative style of Chinese cultural symbols is to reflect the unique oriental style of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, give the gameplay additional cultural meaning, and increase the stickiness of players; the Westernized narrative of the worldview and character settings is to facilitate communication among Western players and improve the spread and acceptance of the game. As a successful overseas product, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> adopts different narrative styles as needed to present foreign players with a game product that perfectly combines Eastern and Western narrative styles.</p>
<h2 id="3-Common-UI-Issues-Text-Overflow"><a href="#3-Common-UI-Issues-Text-Overflow" class="headerlink" title="3. Common UI Issues: Text Overflow"></a>3. Common UI Issues: Text Overflow</h2><p>One of the most common problems in localization practice is text overflow, that is, the target language length exceeds the length of the UI reserved text box in the game, resulting in incomplete text display or text overlap. The main reason for text overflow is that Chinese text is generally compact. When the text content is translated from Chinese to other languages, the number of characters in the target language is often much larger than that of the original text.</p>
<p>In the localization practice of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the number of characters in the full-language text and the number of characters in the Chinese text were pulled and compared. The ratio of the length of different languages relative to Chinese was obtained by using the number of characters in the target language&#x2F;corresponding Chinese characters. Some interesting phenomena were found:</p>
<p>(Note: If the ratio is less than 1, it means that the number of characters in the target language is less than the number of Chinese characters, and there is no risk of text overflow; if the ratio is greater than 1, it means that the number of characters in the target language is greater than the number of Chinese characters. The larger the value, the more serious the risk of text overflow)</p>
<ol>
<li>The risk of text overflow in Korean is the lowest, at 61%; while the risk of text overflow in Thai is the highest, at 81%, and only 19% of the Thai character length does not exceed the corresponding Chinese character length;</li>
</ol>

<li>Among Western languages, the character length distribution of German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian tends to be consistent, which is related to the fact that these languages belong to the Indo-European language family, and there are certain similarities in word origin and grammatical structure; among them, the risk of text overflow in German, French, and Spanish is the same, and they are all relatively high, at 79%, and the risk of text overflow in Russian is slightly lower than other languages, at 73%;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2F37a713b4-6070-45a1-8bbb-f44bfc814824.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;37a713b4-6070-45a1-8bbb-f44bfc814824.png"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Among Eastern languages, the character length distribution of Korean and Japanese is relatively similar, and the distribution of Thai and Vietnamese is relatively similar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Korean and Japanese belong to different language families, their grammatical structures are similar. In simple terms, the similarities between the two: the grammatical structure is subject-object-verb, and they are both “agglutinative languages”, which express grammatical forms through changes in the final ending. In addition, honorifics are developed, and the honorifics used are completely different when facing people of different generations, ages, and social status.</p>
<p>There are also many similarities in the composition and origin of Japanese and Korean vocabulary. They are mainly divided into three categories: Sino-Korean words, native words, and loanwords. Among them, native words are the most important in sentences and can express the core meaning of sentences. Sino-Korean words account for a considerable part of Japanese and Korean, both of which were once deeply influenced by Chinese culture, so Sino-Korean words come from China. In addition, in modern Korean, some Japanese-translated Chinese characters were absorbed to express new concepts. In terms of loanwords, both Korean and Japanese use a large number of transliterated words borrowed from Western languages such as English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fe0c87815-6723-48d3-9cd2-9a7742c0e3ba.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;e0c87815-6723-48d3-9cd2-9a7742c0e3ba.png"></p>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon is that the character length distribution of Thai and Vietnamese, which also belong to Southeast Asian languages, is also very similar. Although Thai uses Thai letters, Vietnamese uses Latin letters. However, in terms of grammar, both Thai and Vietnamese are similar to Chinese, and they are both isolating languages. Verbs have no morphological changes, nouns have no grammatical gender and number forms, and there are no grammatical case changes. Adjectives do not need to maintain grammatical gender, number, and case consistency with the nouns they modify. The basic word order is the same as Chinese, which is the “subject-verb-object” structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220621%2Fb61016d0-7527-4653-8bc7-08e3c06deed5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220621&#x2F;b61016d0-7527-4653-8bc7-08e3c06deed5.png"></p>
<p>In short, the risk of text overflow in various languages generally exists. In response to this situation, the problem can be solved from the following three perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the development stage, front-end personnel can indicate the recommended character length and the maximum allowed character length of the field in the localized resource configuration file;</li>
<li>When the number of characters in the target language is 1-2 times that of Chinese, focus on the accuracy of the language and the conciseness of the language during the localization translation stage. If necessary, abbreviations or manual line breaks can be used;</li>
<li>When the number of characters in the target language is more than 2 times that of Chinese, in the localization testing stage, cooperate closely with the UI team, adjust the length, width, and height of the reserved text box or table, the size of the font, or solve the text display problem through UI design (adding scroll bars), so that the text is displayed completely and the interface layout is reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thunder Fire UX’s global localization team undertook the localization of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in 13 languages. In this process, the global localization team and the interactive experience design team cooperated closely and complemented each other, and promptly solved the display problems in the language packs of various languages, providing a template for the game to go overseas and the efficient localization process.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>As the first game of 24 Entertainment to operate simultaneously in 13 languages, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has been online globally for 10 months, and the peak online on Steam and other platforms is among the top, and it continues to receive praise from players around the world. During this period, Thunder Fire UX’s global localization team has been with us all the way and provided strong support, and constantly searched for the best solution for Chinese games to go overseas in localization practice.</p>

    <title>Those Fashion Sets that &quot;Broke Through&quot; Over the Years</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220627/28584_1026324.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a love for beauty. This is no exception in games. If you want to become more beautiful in the game, in addition to face sculpting and makeup, fashion is essential.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the needs of players for aesthetics and personalized display, fashion also plays a very important role in the revenue of many games. Especially in fair competition games such as MOBA and Battle Royale, fashion and skins are an important part of the revenue. Even in MMO games that emphasize stats, many games have begun to adopt a dual-path operation model of “stats + fashion”.  In some games, fashion appearances are also rewarded as gameplay rewards, becoming another long-term goal in addition to stat rewards, providing players with motivation for daily activities. The importance of fashion to the game is self-evident.</p>
<h2 id="1-Do-Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Always-Sell-Well"><a href="#1-Do-Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Always-Sell-Well" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Beautiful Fashion Sets Always Sell Well?"></a>1. Do Beautiful Fashion Sets Always Sell Well?</h2><p>“What kind of fashion sells well?” is a question often asked at the beginning of many games.</p>
<p>When studying this issue, we often use another concept to replace this question, “What style and design of fashion do players prefer?”  Generally, we would think that players buy a fashion set because the design is beautiful and attractive to them.</p>
<p>However, do beautiful fashion sets always sell well?</p>
<p>The answer is, not necessarily. Beautiful fashion sets do sell relatively better, but it is not a perfect positive correlation.</p>
<h3 id="Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Do-Sell-Relatively-Better-But-It’s-Not-a-Perfect-Positive-Correlation"><a href="#Beautiful-Fashion-Sets-Do-Sell-Relatively-Better-But-It’s-Not-a-Perfect-Positive-Correlation" class="headerlink" title="Beautiful Fashion Sets Do Sell Relatively Better, But It’s Not a Perfect Positive Correlation"></a>Beautiful Fashion Sets Do Sell Relatively Better, But It’s Not a Perfect Positive Correlation</h3><p>When evaluating a fashion set, we often introduce two indicators, one is sales, which represents the objective income brought by the fashion; the other is the approval rating, which represents the player’s subjective evaluation of the fashion’s aesthetics.</p>
<p>Approval rating &#x3D; Number of people who rated it as beautiful &#x2F; (Number of people who rated it as beautiful + Number of people who rated it as not beautiful)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F292f1baf-18af-4825-9513-59ddff9d9a72.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;292f1baf-18af-4825-9513-59ddff9d9a72.png"><br><em>Game A fashion sales and approval rating chart</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fa73af863-f1d8-4bcd-bcdf-f057e6847593.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;a73af863-f1d8-4bcd-bcdf-f057e6847593.png"><br><em>Game B fashion sales and approval rating chart</em></p>
<p>From the two figures above, we can see that, first of all, beautiful fashion sets do sell well, and this is the general trend. However, sales and approval ratings are not perfectly positively correlated.  In particular, the approval ratings of several top-selling fashion sets are not much different from the following fashion sets, but the sales are far apart. (The fashion sets in the charts have similar prices, the same sales methods, and no additional special effects, so they are not affected by these factors)</p>
<h3 id="The-“Breakthrough”-of-High-Sales-Fashion"><a href="#The-“Breakthrough”-of-High-Sales-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="The “Breakthrough” of High-Sales Fashion"></a>The “Breakthrough” of High-Sales Fashion</h3><p>To explain this data, we can start with the players who buy fashion. Through player contact, we can divide players who buy fashion into two categories: one is the fashionista who will steadily buy fashion and almost never miss any fashion sets. They use exclusion factors when making fashion purchase decisions. As long as the fashion is not particularly ugly, they will generally buy it.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be beautiful, but my wardrobe can’t be without it,” is a phrase often uttered by a fashionista friend of mine, which also explains to some extent why the sales of mid-ranked fashion are relatively close.</p>
<p>The other group of non-stable audiences do not have a strong need for “fashion collection” or “changing new clothes”. They will only buy when they really like it or really need it.  Therefore, if there is a significant change in sales, the reason is mainly that it has hit that large group of non-stable audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fd8192344-d0b7-43a0-abf6-ca08f816b89e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;d8192344-d0b7-43a0-abf6-ca08f816b89e.png"></p>
<p>So, what kind of fashion can cause a ripple among this group of non-stable audiences? After carefully studying the players’ discussions on fashion, we found some answers.</p>
<h2 id="2-Those-Fashion-Sets-that-“Broke-Through”-Over-the-Years"><a href="#2-Those-Fashion-Sets-that-“Broke-Through”-Over-the-Years" class="headerlink" title="2. Those Fashion Sets that “Broke Through” Over the Years"></a>2. Those Fashion Sets that “Broke Through” Over the Years</h2><p>For these breakout fashion sets, we can divide them into two categories according to the way they broke out. One is the breakout brought by self-propagation, and the other is the audience of the fashion itself.</p>
<h3 id="Breakout-Brought-by-Self-Propagation-Mainly-Social-Factors"><a href="#Breakout-Brought-by-Self-Propagation-Mainly-Social-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Breakout Brought by Self-Propagation - Mainly Social Factors"></a>Breakout Brought by Self-Propagation - Mainly Social Factors</h3><p>When studying breakout fashion, we found that some breakout fashion sets are accompanied by a very high level of discussion in the game.  Generally, after a new fashion set is released, the number of related keywords in the game will increase briefly, and players will express some opinions on the new fashion.  However, most of the time, the discussion heat of different fashion sets is relatively close, while the discussion heat of some breakout fashion sets can reach 2-3 times that of ordinary fashion.</p>
<p>For example, the following fashion set. In addition to more people participating in the discussion of new fashion, we also saw comments in the game such as: “Male characters, please consciously put on new fashion, don’t make me kneel down and beg you”, “Are there any handsome guys wearing new fashion, give me a location, let me see the abs”.  The first male fashion set with exposed abs in an ancient style game became a carnival for female players in the game.  Many male players who are not usually interested in fashion will also “reluctantly” put on new clothes for this social currency, making this fashion set an annual breakout fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F12d8f513-dd32-4682-bd49-c6b2ea355ef3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;12d8f513-dd32-4682-bd49-c6b2ea355ef3.png"><br><em>Annual Breakout Fashion Set</em></p>
<p>There are also some series of fashion sets, which are also very suitable for group building scenes among female friends and guilds in the game.  In the game, players don’t like to wear the same clothes, but wearing clothes of different colors and standing in a row has a very strong visual effect.  “Family, let’s wear swimsuits and take a group photo together”, “We are the seven swimsuit fairies” are comments that players often mention when discussing these fashion sets.  In order to wear sister outfits with their female friends, to show the relationship of the small group; to participate in the group photo of guild members; or even a shout out on the public screen for a photo, can become the purchase motivation of this group of non-stable fashion audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F6f67dcb9-cfcd-4594-81ac-238f07b14a32.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;6f67dcb9-cfcd-4594-81ac-238f07b14a32.png"><br><em>Seven Swimsuit Fairies</em></p>
<p>In addition, Qixi Festival and Valentine’s Day are also excellent times for buy-one-get-one-free self-propagation and “bundled” sales.</p>
<h3 id="The-Audience-of-the-Fashion-Itself-Fashion-with-a-High-Class-Temperament-is-Easier-to-Attract-More-Players"><a href="#The-Audience-of-the-Fashion-Itself-Fashion-with-a-High-Class-Temperament-is-Easier-to-Attract-More-Players" class="headerlink" title="The Audience of the Fashion Itself - Fashion with a High-Class Temperament is Easier to Attract More Players"></a>The Audience of the Fashion Itself - Fashion with a High-Class Temperament is Easier to Attract More Players</h3><p>In addition to the above-mentioned fashion with social attributes, we also found that fashion sets described by players as “immortal”, “luxurious”, and “noble” often have significantly higher sales.  We speculate that this phenomenon is mainly affected by the following two reasons.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to like the fashion temperament + “Value” &gt; “Price”</p>
<p>① Fashion temperament that everyone can hardly dislike.  When players evaluate fashion, they evaluate the temperament presented by the character after putting on the fashion, rather than the style of the fashion itself. For example, “cute”, “sexy”, “lady-like”, “elegant”. Each temperament will have its own audience, and it is relatively stable, and rejection is also obvious. For example, some people just don’t like to dress cutely and cutely, and prefer a tough and capable temperament. The audience size of this temperament also determines the sales of fashion sets corresponding to this type of temperament.  In a survey of fashion temperament preferences in a certain game, we also found that most of the temperaments correspond to an audience of no more than 30%, that is, to each his own; temperaments such as toughness and competence are relatively niche preferences among female players, so the sales of fashion sets with such temperaments will also be relatively low; while temperaments such as cuteness, immortality, and nobility have a relatively prominent audience among female players, exceeding 40%, so it is not surprising that the sales of fashion sets with such temperaments are high.</p>
<p>② “Value” &gt; “Price”.  When players make fashion purchase decisions, price is inevitably a necessary consideration. When prices are similar, whether it is “worth it” becomes the main criterion. Under the influence of various ancient costume dramas and Xianxia dramas in China, we subconsciously feel that clothes with the temperament of “immortal” and “noble and luxurious” are worn by people of higher status, and the clothes worn by these people of high status are all exquisitely tailored and made of exquisite materials, and the prices are not cheap. Therefore, when a cute fashion set and a noble and gorgeous fashion set are placed in front of the player, the player will naturally feel that the noble and gorgeous clothes are more expensive. When the “value” increases, “value” &gt; “price”, it is easier to make a purchase decision.</p>
<p>(But it is worth noting that the results of fashion temperament here all come from MMO games with oriental themes.  Games with different themes and art styles, and players from different cultural circles will have great differences. For example, in the Japanese server, the niche “dark” temperament in China has become the favorite of Japanese server players.  Temperament is a relatively good dimension for fashion preference research. The results in the text cannot be generalized and are only used as examples)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F26fd4f73-25ce-4507-8103-deee0ebd1ab8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;26fd4f73-25ce-4507-8103-deee0ebd1ab8.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In general, in addition to the aesthetics of the fashion itself (the approval rating of the fashion is also relatively high), the self-propagation brought by social attributes and the character temperament perceived by the player after putting on the fashion (rather than the style of the fashion itself) are all powerful drivers behind these breakout fashion sets.</p>
<p>In multiplayer online games, fashion is not just an appearance. For players, fashion is sometimes a symbol of the relationship between female friends, sometimes a prop for group building among friends, and sometimes an expectation and sustenance for an image that cannot be realized in reality. In the study of fashion, starting from the player side and analyzing and understanding the player’s fashion needs and purchase motivations can also bring us many interesting answers.</p>

    <title>A Powerful Tool to Mobilize Players&#39; Emotions - Quick Time Events (QTE)</title>
    <url>/2022/06/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20220627_28584_1026332/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220627/28584_1026332.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Recently, Sony released the final version of the PlayStation popular game related terminology list - “Game Dictionary”. This list contains more than 100 words and phrases frequently used in the game world, including game types, various gameplay terms, and slang among players. The “QTE” to be introduced next is also among them. It is a gameplay system with rich forms that can be well applied in various games, and it can even be said to be ubiquitous. When you see this term, what game scene comes to your mind first?</p>
<h2 id="1-Introduction-to-QTE"><a href="#1-Introduction-to-QTE" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction to QTE"></a>1. Introduction to QTE</h2><p>QTE, namely Quick-time event. Sony’s game dictionary explains it as a game scene in which players need to respond to multiple screen prompts and enter the correct buttons to trigger specific screen actions.</p>
<p>Players can obtain buffs, advance the game process, or avoid damage by completing QTEs. After decades of development, QTE has become an indispensable gameplay in many games and is widely known.</p>
<p>The history of QTE dates back to video games in the 1980s. Due to technical limitations, some early interactive movie games - such as <em>Dragon’s Lair</em> - pre-recorded established storylines in the form of animation or live-action movies, and then required players to perform specific operations at a fixed time period to facilitate the continued playback of subsequent game content. If the player does not follow the instructions, it will lead to the end of the game or a BAD END. This is one of the sources of QTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F184e3c03-c957-427e-b925-b9167786476f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;184e3c03-c957-427e-b925-b9167786476f.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Dragon’s Lair》 prompts the player to press the left button to enter the next animation</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But the true QTE in the modern sense comes from the milestone masterpiece <em>Shenmue</em> on the Sega Saturn console in 1999. At that time, the game producer Yu Suzuki first proposed the concept of Quick Timer Events. Compared with previous works, <em>Shenmue</em> integrated QTEs into cutscenes and various aspects of the game. There are many chase and fight real-time rendered CGs in the game. During this period, players need to press the correct buttons within a certain period of time according to the prompts on the screen to avoid obstacles or block enemy attacks. If the player presses the wrong button or presses it too slowly, the player may bump into pedestrians or get punched in the face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F95fe147a-ab59-4ee5-8681-9bf5e9b6da02.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;95fe147a-ab59-4ee5-8681-9bf5e9b6da02.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Shenmue》 QTE prompt in the center of the screen</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Since then, QTE operations have begun to be widely used in games, especially action games and interactive movie games. The increasingly rich forms of expression of QTE and its more diverse integration with games have brought unique interactive experiences to players.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-Design-of-QTE"><a href="#2-Interaction-Design-of-QTE" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction Design of QTE"></a>2. Interaction Design of QTE</h2><p>Currently, mainstream QTEs can be divided into two types. The first is a system that tests the player’s instant reaction. In the actual game process, the player must quickly respond to the buttons that appear on the game screen and press the buttons corresponding to the screen. With the development of technology, button operations have also evolved from the initial single button to combination buttons, joystick operations, and so on. The second is a specific or random symbol that moves back and forth quickly within a length. The player needs to press the corresponding button when the symbol moves to the valid area.</p>
<p>QTE relies on screen prompts, which will inevitably involve interaction design. Observing the constituent elements of QTE, the screen prompt includes two parts: “quick time” and “event”.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, the design of “event”, that is, the button, is relatively simple, mainly to make it clear for players to see and not to conflict with the game style. In mobile games, you can draw a schematic diagram of the finger and cooperate with pressing and sliding dynamic effects to prompt the player to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F90deb853-7da9-4781-a582-2460b607704f.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;90deb853-7da9-4781-a582-2460b607704f.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>QTE prompt in the mobile game 《Guardian Tales》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The design of the “quick time” part, that is, the visual representation of the reaction time left for the player, has a richer design expression. The two QTE forms mentioned above are also distinguished by the different design of the player’s response form.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Tomb Raider</em>, buttons appear on the screen to prepare the player, and at the same time, “bullet time” appears to “stretch” the emergency moment for the player to react. When the circle shrinks to the correct size, the player presses the corresponding button to complete the QTE operation. While retaining the “quick” element, it also makes obvious prompts from both the picture and the button dynamic effects, effectively utilizing the player’s reaction time, thereby reducing the player’s cognitive load and improving the player’s QTE experience.</p>

<p>The calibration operation when repairing generators in <em>Identity V</em> is a typical second type of QTE form. A completion judgment area is set on the arc-shaped track, and there is also a perfect judgment area. In the game, a sound prompt appears first, and the right finger area flashes, prompting the player to prepare to tap. Then the judgment area and the red pointer that sweeps across appear, and the player taps the screen to complete the QTE operation. With the help of the length of the track, a richer design of the QTE operation can be carried out that is closer to the game form, such as the length and number of judgment areas. In <em>Identity V</em>, different characters may have different judgment difficulties (different lengths of judgment areas), which also enriches the character mechanism to a certain extent.</p>

Use of QTE in Different Games</h2><p>Music games are a game genre that can be regarded as purely QTE-driven. Precisely because they are so closely integrated with QTE, they don’t immediately come to mind. Combining the judgment method of QTE with the rhythm of music has slowly developed into a separate game category. The difference in buttons and judgment methods has also created various game forms in music games. This natural QTE form is very easy to accept and even becomes a memory of a generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fdc3c0475-68dd-49a4-b4a6-9358522a789b.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;dc3c0475-68dd-49a4-b4a6-9358522a789b.gif"></p>

<p>In action games, there are many ways to bring players the excitement and impact of the picture while simplifying the action. But the most direct way is to work hard on visual expressiveness. The most typical is to increase the effect of animation performance and make sufficiently rich QTE effects.</p>
<p>In the <em>God of War</em> series, QTEs are used to show cinematic plots. They convert various directions of pushing, pulling, and struggling into buttons on the controller, simulating a series of operations. This game hopes that when Kratos is fighting the big boss, players can also participate in this thrilling battle. At the same time, the picture can also retain the cinematic scenes and sense of lens. The first half is handed over to the traditional action mode, and the second half is supplemented by QTE expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F253a50f2-413c-40cc-ad37-d7a9df3958a1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;253a50f2-413c-40cc-ad37-d7a9df3958a1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《God of War》 combines QTE with character actions</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another type of game that makes extensive use of QTE gameplay is interactive movie games. As a plot-driven game genre, it is usually criticized for its lack of gameplay. On the one hand, letting players make various choices and independently decide the direction of the plot greatly deepens the player’s sense of substitution and control; on the other hand, using the tension and sense of operation of QTE, to a certain extent, makes up for the lack of gameplay with a low threshold. Compared with earlier games of the same type, today’s interactive movie games have more interesting designs for the consequences of judgment failure. Whether the QTE is successful or not sometimes determines the direction of different endings. This may be a passive result of the player or an active choice. At the same time, like action games, the position of the UI is no longer fixed in the center or on the left and right sides of the screen, but is combined with the character’s actions to minimize the impact of the inserted QTE operation on the plot immersion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F5aaed015-674b-4eea-add3-e71571557e46.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;5aaed015-674b-4eea-add3-e71571557e46.png"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>It can be seen that QTE has rich applications in various games. “Quick time” is a good way to mobilize players’ emotions. Whether it is to enhance the plot and action of the game, or as a small game form alone, it has good performance. But at the same time, it is also necessary to avoid its abuse, and to reasonably combine it with the game when using it, otherwise it will only interrupt the player’s game experience. Too much is as bad as too little.</p>

    <title>When Players Say &quot;Drop Rate is Low,&quot; What Should You Think About?</title>
    <url>/2022/06/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20220627_28584_1026347/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220627/28584_1026347.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>The “drop rate” is the probability that a player will get a “pleasant surprise” in the game. With the continuous development of game categories and gameplay, the “drop rate” in the player’s mouth has also expanded from the most basic monster drops to card draws, loot boxes, and all “low probability” events. In all player feedback, “drop rate” has always been a hot topic, existing extensively in various public opinions, and game industry personnel cannot avoid responding to it.</p>
<p>Why has “drop rate” received so much attention? How should we understand the “low drop rate” that players talk about? As a game user researcher, how should we dig out the “real problem” behind this feedback?</p>
<h2 id="1-Know-Yourself-and-Your-Enemy-Why-Do-Games-Set-a-“Drop-Rate”"><a href="#1-Know-Yourself-and-Your-Enemy-Why-Do-Games-Set-a-“Drop-Rate”" class="headerlink" title="1. Know Yourself and Your Enemy: Why Do Games Set a “Drop Rate”?"></a>1. Know Yourself and Your Enemy: Why Do Games Set a “Drop Rate”?</h2><p>Compared with the “functionality” emphasized by commonly used apps, games, as a form of entertainment design, pay more attention to the player’s “flow experience.”</p>
<p>The game experience pursues a process that makes players “excited and happy”. When a low-probability event like a “low drop rate” occurs, the pleasure feedback generated by the player will be greater. If doing something can get a reward, it will drive people to repeat it to get the reward multiple times. In games, this reward feedback is more immediate and obvious. Remember when you first came into contact with <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>, how many players wandered around in the wild just for a mutated monster, a precious bubble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F0316427b-241f-4eb4-8438-8769418b3925.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;0316427b-241f-4eb4-8438-8769418b3925.png"></p>

Put Yourself in Their Shoes: How to Understand the “Low Drop Rate” Players Talk About?"></a>2. Put Yourself in Their Shoes: How to Understand the “Low Drop Rate” Players Talk About?</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous article “What Does it Mean When Players Say a Game is ‘Grindy’?”, the “grind” mentioned by players does not necessarily equal the actual time spent in the game, but rather “I feel” that it takes a long time. The same is true for “low drop rate,” which does not necessarily reflect that the game’s numerical settings are really unreasonable, but may just be “I feel” that the drop rate is low.</p>
<p>We can break down the problem behind this as follows:</p>
<h3 id="What-Exactly-is-the-“Drop-Rate”-that-Players-are-Talking-About"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-the-“Drop-Rate”-that-Players-are-Talking-About" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is the “Drop Rate” that Players are Talking About?"></a>What Exactly is the “Drop Rate” that Players are Talking About?</h3><p>“Low drop rate” is not just a “mathematical problem,” but also a game experience problem. And it will produce different situations when it corresponds to different games and different gameplay. To analyze this problem, we need to identify the context in which players mention “drop rate.”</p>
<p>For example, after a card game is launched, it often receives feedback of “low drop rate” in the early stage. Our first reaction might be: to confirm the drop rate… to think about whether the drop rate is very low…</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fa3f780c2-fdc7-49e9-8299-ae0ca89ff9c3.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;a3f780c2-fdc7-49e9-8299-ae0ca89ff9c3.png"></p>
<p>Wait a minute!</p>
<p>Don’t fall into the “number trap” so quickly. Think about it first, is the “drop rate” that the player said consistent with what you understand now? “Low drop rate” does not necessarily mean “the value set by the game is low,” but the gap between the player’s psychological expectations and the current situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F907774b9-df26-43d6-8550-ddbcd6579e54.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;907774b9-df26-43d6-8550-ddbcd6579e54.png"></p>
<p>On the game’s official website and card draw page, developers have disclosed the probability of high-level items appearing. At this time, it is not necessarily the “item” itself that is the problem, but that there are items and characters in this pool. The guaranteed minimum that players want is a “character”, but what they may draw is an “item”. Therefore, even if they draw a guaranteed item, some players will think that the “experience is not good”. They didn’t get what they wanted, and they may even feel unhappy because they “wasted a guaranteed opportunity”.</p>
<p>So in this scenario, the “low drop rate” that players are talking about should actually be interpreted as “low probability of dropping characters”. Knowing the player’s needs makes it easier for us to take the next step. In subsequent updates, the product also improves the player’s experience in drawing cards through more detailed card pools, designated guaranteed directions, and exchange of specific cards after a certain number of draws. These are specific adjustments made based on specific issues.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Do-Players-Think-the-“Drop-Rate”-is-Low"><a href="#Why-Do-Players-Think-the-“Drop-Rate”-is-Low" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Players Think the “Drop Rate” is Low?"></a>Why Do Players Think the “Drop Rate” is Low?</h3><p>So why do players frequently report “low drop rate” problems?</p>
<p><strong>The first common reason: “Unscientific experimental attempts” and “Survivorship Bias”</strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, domestic online games are required to disclose the probability of drawing or synthesizing, but although the probability has been disclosed, “misunderstandings” still exist.</p>
<p>Example: The success probability of strengthening in a certain game is announced as 25%. Players may subconsciously think that this means “as long as I strengthen 4 times, it is a 100% probability”. This is definitely unreasonable from a statistical point of view. Probability cannot be accumulated. Each strengthening is a separate event. “25%” is an expected value, not a guaranteed result. But it is easy to be subjective in player feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, players who are particularly lucky are also more willing to show their results on public platforms, that is, “Survivorship Bias”, which makes other players who browse the posts more unbalanced: “Why are they all so lucky? Is this game targeting me?”</p>
<p>Here we also recommend a previous article “Demystifying How Random Numbers Are Generated”, which may help you more intuitively see the distribution of 10,000 people drawing 100 cards and obtaining SSRs in a purely random state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Ffab47a52-918a-4b1f-a1c5-656596998e63.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;fab47a52-918a-4b1f-a1c5-656596998e63.png"></p>
<p><strong>The second common reason: The profound impression under the influence of the “Zeigarnik Effect”</strong></p>
<p>People have a natural drive to “finish things from beginning to end”. The reason why they forget the completed work is because the motivation to complete it has been satisfied. If the work is not yet complete, this motivation makes people have a deep impression of it.</p>
<p>This mentality of keeping unfinished things deeply in memory is called the Zeigarnik Effect. The same is true in games. Players will have goals and tasks one by one. For example, after a new card pool comes out, players want to draw a new character. When they haven’t drawn it, they always feel uneasy and upset, and have an unfinished emotion. This emotion enhances the player’s memory of their card draw status (how many draws, what pity pulls), and keeps driving them until they draw the target card.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the number of players who obtain items at normal odds is larger in the overall player group, posts complaining about “low drop rates” can always outperform in terms of the number of feedbacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Fecb0f19f-3576-40e8-98c6-2bbc24086391.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;ecb0f19f-3576-40e8-98c6-2bbc24086391.png"></p>
<h3 id="Not-Noticing-What-the-“Core-Problem”-Is"><a href="#Not-Noticing-What-the-“Core-Problem”-Is" class="headerlink" title="Not Noticing What the “Core Problem” Is"></a>Not Noticing What the “Core Problem” Is</h3><p>Most of the time, “drop rate” is not the core contradiction, other problems are. The game has a complex system. In this system, dropping equipment is not the whole of the game, let alone the whole of the player experience. The feedback that players ultimately express seems to be a “drop rate” problem, but it is not actually caused by the drop rate, but other content of the game that amplifies this problem.</p>
<p>In a player survey, we had this conversation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F93e02b56-203e-4798-aee1-2eb99faea2da.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;93e02b56-203e-4798-aee1-2eb99faea2da.png"></p>
<p>Here, the player thinks that the “low drop rate” is slowing down his development speed, and we should reflect on what methods we have designed to help players improve, and why these methods have not been effective. Perhaps the game provides too few channels for players to improve. In addition to direct drops, can players obtain them through trading, crafting, etc.?</p>
<p>That is to say, to solve this “drop rate” problem, we actually need to look at the development design provided by the game, whether it is rich and adapted to the player’s game habits. More output channels and the conversion between discarded equipment may all be directions for optimization.</p>
<p>There are two perspectives that can help us think about and break down the “low drop rate” problem.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking direction 1: Use “game design” to reverse engineer the drop rate problem, and trace back to the pre-drop rate link</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that the operation directly related to the drop rate is an “activity”, we need to calculate the player’s “effort” in it. The more complex and difficult the activity, the different the player’s feedback will be.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking direction 2: Use “user experience” to reverse engineer the drop rate problem, and what other factors have an impact</strong></p>
<p>The various links in the game are interconnected. When analyzing player feedback, consider whether the problem of low drop rate raised by the player at this time can be transformed into focusing on the player’s feelings in daily gameplay, and analyzing whether the current player’s combat power level&#x2F;achievement status&#x2F;game goals have reached a bottleneck or far exceed the game development progress.</p>
<p>In summary, when we encounter feedback of “low drop rate”, we might as well ask a few more “whys”. Why do players think the drop rate is low? And why do players think that the low drop rate is the most important factor affecting their gaming experience?</p>
<h2 id="3-Countermeasures-How-to-Adjust-in-the-Face-of-“Low-Drop-Rate”"><a href="#3-Countermeasures-How-to-Adjust-in-the-Face-of-“Low-Drop-Rate”" class="headerlink" title="3. Countermeasures: How to Adjust in the Face of “Low Drop Rate”?"></a>3. Countermeasures: How to Adjust in the Face of “Low Drop Rate”?</h2><h3 id="Will-Increasing-the-Drop-Rate-Solve-the-Problem"><a href="#Will-Increasing-the-Drop-Rate-Solve-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Will Increasing the Drop Rate Solve the Problem?"></a>Will Increasing the Drop Rate Solve the Problem?</h3><p>In response to the “low drop rate” problem, directly “adjusting the drop rate” is certainly not the best choice. In all user experience optimization, we must refuse the behavior of “treating the symptoms but not the root cause”. In the cases mentioned above, we have seen the different root causes that can be derived from the same feedback of “low drop rate”: “what is dropped is not what is wanted”, “there are few channels for development”, “the pre-activity is too boring&#x2F;too difficult” and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine what would happen if the drop rate were increased?</p>
<p>① Games focus on the state of flow. The reason why “dropping top-quality equipment” can make players think it is interesting and interesting is precisely because of its scarcity. If a prop with a 10% drop rate is changed to a 90% drop, what excitement will players have?</p>
<p>② What if it’s just a fine-tuning? For example, adjust the probability of 10% to 20%, which maintains the rarity and does increase the drop rate. If this is the case, it cannot eradicate the player’s perception of probability. Under a large sample, this adjustment of the drop rate may be diluted, and there will still be some players who will achieve it in a way that far exceeds the actual probability - they will still receive a lot of feedback about the low drop rate.</p>
<p>③ What about adding a guaranteed mechanism? The guaranteed mechanism is indeed the current mainstream operating model. At least players can get a reward after a certain number of times. But there is also a problem with this. What kind of guarantee is “conscientious”? When the game is directly linked to payment, this matter becomes even more difficult to please everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2F8f9d1886-6eb7-442b-878a-89d9a8df357e.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;8f9d1886-6eb7-442b-878a-89d9a8df357e.png"></p>

Players may raise the problem of low drop rate at different stages of the game version. We need to keep tracking and constantly analyzing: Perhaps the solution we designed in the previous time did not achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>For example, unlike the “guaranteed” method used in the card draw gameplay, the common method in cultivation games is to produce a substitute material A. Even if the player cannot obtain the equipment by directly farming, they can also obtain material A with a certain probability. After accumulating a certain amount, they can use A to make the desired props. If the player mentions “low drop rate” again under this condition, we can further analyze the effect and usage of material A: whether the drop also involves probability, which lengthens the timeline? Is the threshold too high, and players are caught in a cycle of wanting to get material A to improve their equipment, but their equipment needs to be made with material A.</p>

The premise of localization is whether the game is open to the target region. Secondly, it is to modify and adjust the content in the game appropriately according to regional differences. Of course, the main content of localization work is to unify things that are well known abroad but little known domestically into popular domestic terms. This article will introduce what game localization is from several directions: process, cases, and market.</p>

<li><p><strong>Step 1: Integration and analysis of game content.</strong> Combining the core gameplay and market conditions, the localization team obtains a player profile through a comprehensive assessment, and completes the rating of the game product at the same time. Regional differences breed different cultures. Usually, the localization team needs to integrate specific content in the game, such as text, audio, and some specific elements, and continue to follow up on subsequent translation and optimization after systematic analysis. According to the resources required for the localization project, overall analysis can not only clarify the project direction, but also help the project manager formulate project plans and promote budget execution.</p>

<li><p><strong>Step 2: Sorting and packaging of original game materials.</strong> Game materials related to localization needs usually include game code, audio, text, and even the introduction of the game background. In addition, a corpus is also essential, including Translation Memory, Term Bases, and Style Guide. Sorting and packaging the original materials can better provide them to the staff of the localization project and corresponding suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 3: Localization of game code.</strong> After confirming the code text that needs to be localized, extract the relevant strings in the game code and transfer them to the Translation Management System. In this process, if the code is not suitable for localization, or is not efficient enough and requires repeated work, thereby increasing labor costs, the code should also be iterated and optimized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 4: Integration of the translation management system.</strong> After the strings in the game code are entered into the translation management system, it is necessary to intervene in the translation platform or Computer Aided Translation tools to support translators in translation. In this process, if the translation management system has already integrated related auxiliary tools, then only need to add the translator to the system, and assign tasks to promote translation work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 5: Translator translation.</strong> The progress of translation can be detected from the translation management system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 6: Localization of other non-text elements.</strong> According to the player profile, target market culture, and needs, some elements of the game need to be adjusted and modified to suit the target audience. In this process, cultural taboo issues need special attention.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 7: Quality inspection.</strong> The quality inspection of translation includes grammar, spelling, semantics, and whether the terminology translation is consistent. After the translation is imported into the game and the integration is completed, it is also necessary to screen for functional bugs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 8: Integration and adaptation adjustment of localized content.</strong> Integrate the reviewed translated text with the completed localized game content. If functional bugs are found after screening, they need to be repaired and the adaptability of the UI user interface needs to be adjusted to ensure that the text can be displayed in the appropriate position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In game design, the earlier the localization needs are considered, the easier the subsequent localization work will be. In addition to the above steps, Thai localization also has some issues that require special attention, such as overlapping diacritic marks.</p>

Common Localization and UI Problems</h2><h3 id="Incomplete-display-of-diacritic-marks-a-common-problem-in-Thai-games"><a href="#Incomplete-display-of-diacritic-marks-a-common-problem-in-Thai-games" class="headerlink" title="Incomplete display of diacritic marks, a common problem in Thai games"></a>Incomplete display of diacritic marks, a common problem in Thai games</h3><p>90% of Thai games have the problem of incomplete display of diacritic marks. Incomplete display of diacritic marks means that when vowels and tones are typed in the same position, they will often overlap in the same position, or the spacing is too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220627%2Ffb8b0434-f638-4eee-a588-749c42a52001.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220627&#x2F;fb8b0434-f638-4eee-a588-749c42a52001.png"></p>
<p>From the picture above, we can see that the word in the rightmost part has overlapping diacritic marks, making it impossible to read the word normally.</p>
<p>This problem has long existed in many Thai games. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also had this problem during the Thai localization development stage. In order to successfully complete the localization of the Thai version of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the global localization team, the interaction experience design team, and the product program team worked together to provide a model for game globalization and efficient localization process. In fact, most Thai players know about this problem, but players don’t pay much attention to it unless it causes the original meaning of the word to change. For example, in the picture above, one of the diacritic marks of หมาป่าขนทอง (Rong Jin Wolf) disappears, resulting in the meaning becoming “dog throws golden Rong”. Once this type of problem is seen by players, it may be ridiculed. However, this problem was well solved during the localization process of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, making the localization quality of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in Thai receive more praise from players than other games. Therefore, players have a huge sense of intimacy with the game during the game experience, which has become one of the reasons why many Thai players choose <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>

<p><em>《Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment》</em></p>
<p><em>Sword Art Online</em> is a popular cross-media game, covering comics, animation, and video games, and it has gained a considerable number of fans in the West. <em>Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization</em> was listed as one of the best anime series games in 2017.</p>
<p>But its second part, <em>Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment</em>, has many problems in the Western market, and localization is one of them. From the picture, we can see that the customer said: Hey, is that black man sexually harassing the maid?</p>
<p>But in fact, the black man the customer said refers to the male protagonist Kirito in black, not a black man. In this scene, Kirito did not make any sexual harassment behavior. Such localization errors will seriously affect the player’s experience of the game.</p>

<li>34% of players play shooting games on PC</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes sense, because in the past 6 months, more than one-third of Thai players have played <em>GTA</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> (35% for each game). Considering the huge consumption potential of Thai players, it makes great sense to localize games for this emerging market.</p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>As it stands, the development trend of Thai games will continue to rise, and the proportion of player growth will also increase correspondingly. From the player growth rate of only 13.78% in 2018 to the instant increase to 34.89% in 2020, it is not difficult to see that Thai games still have a lot of room for development. Text is one of the parts that players have the most contact with. No matter how fun the game is, if players can’t understand the text, the game experience will be worse. Game localization is often misunderstood as simply copying and pasting with translation tools, but it actually involves many professional skills. In addition to being proficient in the corresponding language, localization staff also need to be very familiar with the product and the market. It is necessary to consider what kind of expression is most suitable for the target audience and avoid cultural conflicts and other problems.</p>
<p>Many game developers regard localization as the final link in the game development cycle. For them, this is like an extra step. But in fact, this approach is not wise, but will make the game miss the opportunity of overseas markets. When a product has not been localized and entered the local market, it may face a large number of copycat products in the local market, and thus return without success. If localization is carried out after similar situations occur, it will lead to the need to rewrite the source code and create translation materials. When players choose to experience new games, localization will also be one of the factors that players consider. Excellent localization is more like a reassurance. In addition to giving players a better gaming experience, it can also make players feel that the developers are making games with their hearts, so that players can feel more at ease when experiencing the game.</p>

    <title>The Evolution of Game Subtitle Design</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220628/28584_1026657.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Movie subtitles, as frequent visitors to the big screen, have a profound impact on the film and television industry. But when we turn our attention to game subtitles, the situation seems a bit subtle. Players immersed in the audio-visual feast may often not notice the small subtitles, and sometimes even think that subtitles are obstacles that hinder them from taking screenshots and enjoying the game. In some games that do not pay much attention to UI design, game subtitles may be routinely delisted. You may ask: Is it wrong to look for subtitles in the game world? But perhaps, there are far more design points in game subtitles than you think.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Past-and-Present-of-Game-Subtitles"><a href="#1-The-Past-and-Present-of-Game-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="1. The Past and Present of Game Subtitles"></a>1. The Past and Present of Game Subtitles</h2><h3 id="1940s-The-Era-of-Title-Cards"><a href="#1940s-The-Era-of-Title-Cards" class="headerlink" title="1940s: The Era of Title Cards"></a>1940s: The Era of Title Cards</h3><p>Have you ever thought about this question: In the past when computer technology and digital photography were underdeveloped, in the era of film and even silent films, how did subtitles appear?</p>
<p>Before the subtitles we are familiar with now were born, filmmakers printed important subtitles on the bottom plate to make “title cards”, which were photographed and inserted into the movie sequence frames to express key plot content. The era when “title cards” flourished was the golden age of silent films. The unique advantage of title cards is that the translation of movies becomes very easy. Filmmakers only need to remove and replace the title cards to complete the translation of the movie. Behind the small title cards is the export of a large number of films and the spread and penetration of culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fb2bf25fa-9332-4a5e-bbe1-5e1f5267f716.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;b2bf25fa-9332-4a5e-bbe1-5e1f5267f716.png"></p>

<p><em>Title card in a Chaplin film</em></p>

<p>Technology brings development, and demand brings progress. Sound films, a rich form, soon appeared, and title cards gradually withdrew from the public eye. But before the producers had time to celebrate the innovation of film technology, the difficulty of film translation followed. If you want to export your own movies, whether it is remake or dubbing, the cost is extremely high. It can be said that demand forces progress. Less than two years after the advent of sound films, subtitle technology was born and has been continuously iterated and evolved in the following years.</p>
<h3 id="1980s-CC-Subtitles-and-Accessibility-Design"><a href="#1980s-CC-Subtitles-and-Accessibility-Design" class="headerlink" title="1980s: CC Subtitles and Accessibility Design"></a>1980s: CC Subtitles and Accessibility Design</h3><p>As mentioned above, the emergence of subtitles was originally to make movies easier to watch and more efficient to spread. It is foreseeable that the emergence of subtitles will not only erase cultural boundaries, but also break the shackles of disability.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, a more detailed subtitle form with auxiliary functions, “Closed Captioning”, was born, which was later known as “CC subtitles”. In this kind of subtitles, not only the dialogue of the characters will be presented, but also the key music, sound effects, and the name and even the corresponding position of the speaker in the scene will be marked, so that people with hearing impairment can also enjoy the program content. Apple’s products and promotional videos have provided good support for CC subtitles, and bilibili in China also provides CC subtitle options.</p>

At the end of the 20th century, with the rapid improvement of the game industry in technology and thought, subtitles, a very functional component, and some established usage rules were also extended to game products.</p>

<p><em>Game “Half-Life”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This is also an important node in the history of games. The famous id Software developed and shared the Quake engine, and Valve created its first game “Half-Life” based on it. “Half-Life” is a brand new type of game with cinematic narrative, coherent level design, a lot of dialogue and descriptive text. Because of this, many unexpected problems also appeared, including the embarrassing situation that the experience was affected because the dialogue could not be heard clearly. Early games did not have a lot of plots and descriptions, and did not rely on text for assistance, so naturally there was no such problem. Fortunately, there were experts among the people. Due to the convenience of the Quake engine, excellent subtitle mods and other mods continued to emerge, which improved the game experience and added fuel to the development of game subtitles.</p>
<h3 id="Today-From-Subtitles-Default-Off-to-Subtitles-Default-On"><a href="#Today-From-Subtitles-Default-Off-to-Subtitles-Default-On" class="headerlink" title="Today: From Subtitles Default Off to Subtitles Default On"></a>Today: From Subtitles Default Off to Subtitles Default On</h3><p>For players of the millennial generation, subtitles in games seem to be there by nature. They are like air. You often hardly notice their existence. Only when you are “short of breath” (can’t see the subtitles clearly) will you curse the game interaction designer. But we can see from the above that game subtitles did not exist at the beginning, and there has been a lot of experience from the default off of game subtitles to the default on of game subtitles.</p>
<p>At the beginning of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the protagonist John, sitting on the train, listens to the chatter of men, women and children in the carriage, thus introducing the entire game world. However, if you are a player who is not good at listening, this group dialogue is more like a lullaby, so that you have to turn on the subtitles and watch it again. This situation was not uncommon at that time, because many games maintained the habit of “subtitles default off”. Today, many games, including <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, default game subtitles on. This change in status also reflects that the status of subtitles is gradually improving, and developers are becoming more and more user-friendly.</p>
<p>For normal users, their hearing is sufficient to support them to understand the content without turning on subtitles. But in special cases, such as when the surrounding environment is very noisy and the player has difficulty concentrating on listening, subtitles will be very valuable.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also conclude from the history of subtitle development that there are four scenarios suitable for game subtitles: for games with localization needs, for players with hearing impairments to play games, for intense and exciting games where users cannot concentrate on listening, and for playing games in noisy environments.</p>
<h2 id="2-Common-Problems-in-Game-Subtitle-Design"><a href="#2-Common-Problems-in-Game-Subtitle-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Common Problems in Game Subtitle Design"></a>2. Common Problems in Game Subtitle Design</h2><h3 id="Font-Size"><a href="#Font-Size" class="headerlink" title="Font Size"></a>Font Size</h3><p>The first is the choice of text size. If the font is too large, it will block the line of sight; if the font is too small, it will be difficult for players to distinguish the dialogue content of the game. For developers, the most important thing to consider is that for different players and different game devices, the suitable font size is not the same. For example, some players may have high-performance hosts and a super-large curved screen in front of them when playing games; while some players may only be able to let their small and thin laptops bear the burden. Therefore, the best solution is that the developers have considered these factors during testing, and tested the game effects under different game devices and playing distances, and ensured the readability of the text in most cases. Of course, you can also add custom options for users so that they can choose the text size themselves. But I personally think that the best solution is to let the developers complete the 99 steps of the design, such as making highly versatile designs or self-adaptive designs, and players do not need to make too many choices or changes for comfort.</p>
<p>We can also learn from the established norms of other industries. Amazon’s UI guidelines stipulate that 1080p, UI text uses a minimum of 28px. Channel 4 in the UK requires that all high-definition subtitle specifications should be 46px, and standard definition should be 26px.</p>
<h3 id="Contrast"><a href="#Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Contrast"></a>Contrast</h3><p>In subtitle design, it is very important that the text needs to have a high contrast with the background to ensure that the text is easy to read. Sometimes, as the game background changes, the text will be blurred because it is too close to the background color. The general and most economical solution is to add a dialog box. The translucent dialog box can ensure the high contrast between the text and the background without destroying the game screen. Some games also use the text color to change with the background to improve the contrast. For example, the game <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, which will be discussed later, its text will change in real time with the different colors of the scene to ensure that the text is readable throughout the process.</p>
<p>Designers need to pay special attention to the use of red, because for most color-blind players, red will appear dark brown.</p>
<h3 id="Too-Much-Text"><a href="#Too-Much-Text" class="headerlink" title="Too Much Text"></a>Too Much Text</h3><p>When arranging text content, you should avoid presenting too much text at one time, which will not only affect the game experience, but also cause reading difficulties. Line-by-line typesetting and reasonable sentence breaks can greatly improve readability. Line-by-line typesetting needs to control a single subtitle to about two lines; reasonable sentence breaks are based on natural pauses, plus the punctuation marks of the sentence.</p>
<p>Game subtitles can also learn from the standards of the television industry in various countries or regions. If it is really necessary to present subtitles in multiple lines, the first line should be the longest, but at the same time, the length of each line should be roughly the same.</p>
<h3 id="Automatic-Mode"><a href="#Automatic-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Automatic Mode"></a>Automatic Mode</h3><p>I believe that everyone has had the experience of turning on the automatic playback mode because they had to free their hands to eat snacks when going through the plot, and the playback speed here is also something that developers need to consider. Different players have different reading speeds. For example, for children, they need more time to read the same text. The reading speed needs to consider most players, and relevant literature or established UI design specifications can be referred to. The most ideal state is to set multiple speeds for players to choose.</p>

Advanced Usage Guide for Game Subtitles</h2><p>After talking about the basic part of subtitle design, let’s take a look at the advanced application tutorial examples of subtitle design - <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>. From the purpose and effect of subtitles, I divide them into three categories: assisting immersive experience, guiding players’ vision, and enhancing the sense of game interaction.</p>
<h3 id="Auxiliary-Immersion-Experience"><a href="#Auxiliary-Immersion-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Auxiliary Immersion Experience"></a>Auxiliary Immersion Experience</h3><p>(1) Floating Subtitles</p>
<p>The most intuitive way in the game is to present the main plot of the game with a large number of floating subtitles. These floating subtitles appear on the player’s travel route, allowing the player to experience the feeling of deepening in time and space with the plot. At the same time, these subtitles will also take into account the player’s current perspective. For example, in Molly’s story, the Molly played by the player finally becomes a snake. At this time, the arrangement of subtitles is based on the snake’s perspective.</p>

<p>(2) Text Reading</p>
<p>The large background narration and story description in the game are presented in the form of letters. The player seems to have really become a person in the game, reading the text that can be flipped through and written in the game, rather than reading the subtitles at a fixed position on the screen. For example, at the beginning of the game, the protagonist played by the player opens the diary left by his mother on the boat and learns about the past stories of the family; in Barbara’s story, the player reads Barbara’s story by reading the comics. The design of the text is also the style of comic-style dialog boxes, or exaggerated onomatopoeia. Every time the player experiences the story of a family member, he will open the diary he carries with him and draw a portrait of this person on the family tree, and this interface is also our menu interface.</p>

<p>(3) Text Transition</p>
<p>The way players enter or exit the story of a family member is by reading the letters or reports left by him or his relatives and friends found in his room. The text transition is very smooth and easy to make people feel that they are not finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F5db0330a-b757-4490-8a85-74953c5e466a.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;5db0330a-b757-4490-8a85-74953c5e466a.gif"></p>
<p>For example, Walter, goes outside after 30 years. He sees the light, but at the same instance, is taken by a train.</p>

<h3 id="Visual-Guidance"><a href="#Visual-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Visual Guidance"></a>Visual Guidance</h3><p>(1) Guiding Items</p>
<p>The most commonly used method in the game is to place relevant plot subtitles around related items, plus a certain forced perspective conversion, to achieve the role of emphasizing and pointing to specific items. At the same time, this method is also used to guide interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F7acc3bff-969c-4c72-8a6d-91b38a6cedbc.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;7acc3bff-969c-4c72-8a6d-91b38a6cedbc.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fce6cf03e-2b08-4490-b1a4-a6bba07ee36b.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;ce6cf03e-2b08-4490-b1a4-a6bba07ee36b.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F2f4b9eae-1ef8-4775-a264-0b93f825de44.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;2f4b9eae-1ef8-4775-a264-0b93f825de44.gif"></p>
<p>The position of the subtitles guides the player to the tent in the corner, so that the player unknowingly completes the content of blowing over the tent in the plot. The player’s surprise when the effect is triggered unconsciously is exactly what the designer hopes the player will empathize with the protagonist in the game.</p>
<p>(2) Text Disappearing Effect</p>
<p>The special effect of text disappearing can also be used to make a big fuss. For example, in order to guide the player to make the action of “lying on the peephole and looking into the room”, the designer makes the disappearing effect of the relevant plot text be sucked in by the peephole, naturally guiding the player to the peephole. And the entrance to the underground cave is in a very remote place in the player’s initial perspective, and the game also guides the player to find the entrance through the text disappearing effect.</p>

<p>(3) Enhancing Game Interaction</p>
<p>The interactivity of subtitles is also a unique part of this game. Some interactive texts can greatly enhance the player’s gaming experience. For example, as the player pushes open the fence, the text is scattered on the ground, giving the player feedback and bringing a different kind of small surprise. The player manipulates the kite to return the plot text to its place, so that the player can empathize with the character who is flying the kite while thinking richly. The text plays the perspective of the rock, and as the Walter played by the player smashes the underground cave, it rises and falls and is finally smashed.</p>

The Future of Game Subtitles: How to Design VR Subtitles"></a>4. The Future of Game Subtitles: How to Design VR Subtitles</h2><p>When talking about the development history of subtitles earlier, it is easy for us to find that demand drives progress. The emergence of VR games and the demand for VR subtitles naturally also require designers to master certain VR subtitle design points. From the most basic readability and comfort, designers need to consider not only the text itself, but also the presentation of text by VR hardware and the space where the player is located is no longer a comfortable sofa and a super large display, but a heavy head-mounted device and a dizzying panoramic space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Ff9419c4b-97fa-4561-a130-4badbf6c56ae.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;f9419c4b-97fa-4561-a130-4badbf6c56ae.png"></p>

<p><em>Subtitles in the VR game “Half-Life: Alyx”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From the perspective of readability, the first thing to pay attention to is the distortion of the space in VR. Designers cannot simply place two-dimensional UI information directly, but need to redesign the interaction method and interaction range according to the VR operation characteristics and habits. At the same time, different from flat two-dimensional design, the unique property of VR is the depth of field (Z axis). The Z axis expands the possibility of interaction forms, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the physiological characteristics of players having difficulty focusing when the Z axis distance is too far. Secondly, there is the problem of resolution. Since the current VR standards for various platforms are not uniform, the resolution of elements in some platforms is extremely low, and thin lines are prone to serious jagged problems. Therefore, interactive designers should avoid line-shaped icons and fonts that are too small and too thin. Finally, there is the design of dynamic effects, which should not only avoid competing for the attention of the theme information, but also pay attention to the fact that excessive dynamic effects in the VR environment are more likely to make users dizzy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F55e67059-783f-4c4b-b99b-2fdbcd9e83ad.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;55e67059-783f-4c4b-b99b-2fdbcd9e83ad.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Interactive Guidance in “Half-Life: Alyx”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From the perspective of comfort, thousands of words can be summed up in one sentence: reduce head movement to reduce dizziness. Since the VR screen has no edges, designers need to place elements and interactions within the field of view as much as possible, so that users do not need to turn their heads hard. In places with frequent interaction, try to reduce the amplitude of dynamic effects, avoid narrowness or excessive brightness, and reduce users’ dizziness and visual fatigue. At the same time, for moving street scenes or objects, try to adopt a constant speed to avoid users suffering from motion sickness.</p>

    <title>Why Do Player Surveys Need to Talk to Players About Their Lives?</title>
    <url>/2022/04/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20220628_28584_1026665/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220628/28584_1026665.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>

<h2 id="1-What-Do-Player-Surveys-Usually-Survey"><a href="#1-What-Do-Player-Surveys-Usually-Survey" class="headerlink" title="1. What Do Player Surveys Usually Survey?"></a>1. What Do Player Surveys Usually Survey?</h2><p>Long-time followers of NetEase ThunderFire UX should already be familiar with various user research methods from previous articles. Common user research methods include questionnaire surveys, user interviews, lab tests, focus groups, street intercept tests, etc. Research methods always revolve around the problems encountered in each stage of game development. We try to help solve various problems encountered by the product through player research. In the early stages of the game, we will investigate the current market situation and the needs of players for specific types of games; in rapid development, we will investigate whether the current core gameplay of the game is sufficiently competitive in the market, and whether the game’s novice guidance is smooth; after the game is launched, we will also investigate the opinions and needs of various players on the game.</p>
<p>All player research can be said to be goal-oriented. We need to draw clear and effective conclusions to better optimize the game. Because of this, we are so focused on any small problem in the game, and hope to improve the game’s new additions, payment, and retention by changing it. However, playing a game is a dynamic interaction process between the player and the game. Each player’s game behavior is not only affected by game factors, but also by the complex factor of “himself”. Before becoming a player, a player is already a living person, a complex individual who has already formed his own preferences and attitudes, and a social role with various social identities. It can be said that what kind of person a player is predicts what kind of behavior he will have. If you cannot jump out of the game itself to sensually understand the player, you cannot rationally understand the player’s various incredible behaviors in the game. However, this part of player research is often ignored, and is considered to be of little help in solving actual game problems.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Talk-to-Players-About-Life-in-Player-Research"><a href="#2-Why-Talk-to-Players-About-Life-in-Player-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Talk to Players About Life in Player Research?"></a>2. Why Talk to Players About Life in Player Research?</h2><p>As the years of doing user research work increase, we are increasingly “off-topic” when doing player research. We no longer only talk to players about games, but also start to talk to players about life. This seemingly inexplicable operation is due to the fact that all human behavior is determined by their own needs, and humans are social animals. To understand player needs, you must understand the player’s life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fa7fbda22-2f78-4674-ac93-06812daa3031.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;a7fbda22-2f78-4674-ac93-06812daa3031.png"></p>
<p>When doing MMO player research, we once came into contact with a player. His way of playing MMOs was very different from that of ordinary MMO players. He neither cultivated combat power nor participated in activities, but he was online for a very long time every day. Why is he so loyal to this game?</p>
<p>We tried to dig out some of his views on the game, but found that his evaluations of all the game systems were mediocre, just saying that the game atmosphere was very good. He just hangs up in the game every day, mainly to see if anyone is looking for him to chat, and then to see what everyone is saying in the guild channel. Such a game experience seems to be no fun at all in the eyes of ordinary people, but he has been playing like this for several years. Until we asked about his life status, he said that he is now the main source of income for the family and has great pressure at work, but this negative energy cannot be told to family and friends. Society does not seem to allow middle-aged men to admit their vulnerability, so he chose to talk to netizens in the game. “I can talk to friends in the game, purely to find someone to chat and talk to. We are friends when we are online, and we have our own lives when we are offline. We can comfort and tease each other.”</p>
<p>In this way, it is not difficult to understand that for him, the game is more of a place to relieve real-world pressure, and the quality of the gameplay is irrelevant to him, so he can play an MMO like a chat app. He is not attracted to other new games on the market with more diverse gameplay, so he can stay loyal.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Factors-Influence-Players’-Game-Motivation"><a href="#3-What-Factors-Influence-Players’-Game-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="3. What Factors Influence Players’ Game Motivation?"></a>3. What Factors Influence Players’ Game Motivation?</h2><p>Many researchers have explored how players’ game motivation affects their game behavior, and have divided players into different types based on their behavior. The most famous of these is probably Bartle’s player model, which divides players into Killers, Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers along four dimensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F169d9806-08f4-4487-a85c-99d593ffa574.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;169d9806-08f4-4487-a85c-99d593ffa574.png"></p>
<p>The X-axis is the object in the game, and the Y-axis is the method in the game. Simply put, killer players like to take action against players, and they are keen to defeat others; achiever players like to take action against the world, and they are happy to complete various tasks and goals in the game; social players like to interact with players, and they are even more interested in game players than in the game itself; explorer players like to interact with the game world, and they are happy to explore various contents in the game.</p>
<p>Quantic Foundry’s model extracts 12 player game motivations through cluster analysis, and divides players into 6 categories: “Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement, Immersion, and Creativity”. It will not be elaborated here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F5e2900cc-c1f4-4d2c-ab45-90292c506770.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;5e2900cc-c1f4-4d2c-ab45-90292c506770.png"></p>
<p>These models effectively help us understand players from the perspective of needs. We can know from them what specific needs in the game affect players’ behavior of playing games, that is, what players really want to do in the game.</p>
<p>In actual research, we found that players’ needs are not only affected by in-game factors, but also by out-of-game factors. If we go one step further and regard games as a kind of ordinary entertainment activity, and think about why players play games, we will find some interesting things. For example, players who choose to play games are not necessarily real gamers. Some out-of-game factors that we often ignore are also affecting players’ game motivation, including the player’s life status, and the player’s attitude and concept of the game.</p>
<p>We found that some players choose to play games out of real love. They believe that games give meaning to their lives and are the best way to mobilize energy. Correspondingly, they often have their own clear preferences and attitudes in game selection, and their behavior is relatively consistent. We can easily classify these players into one of the above player models.</p>
<p>Another part of players, when talking about games, regard games as a regulator of daily life. For them, games are not much different from other entertainment activities such as watching movies, and are mainly for relaxing themselves. These popcorn-type players often pay more attention to the visuals and excitement of the game, but may not have high requirements for gameplay. They are also relatively more susceptible to changes in life. For example, they may suddenly churn if they are busy recently, and may return without reason after being idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fbdb7d85c-feee-456d-abf0-bb4c144c2932.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;bdb7d85c-feee-456d-abf0-bb4c144c2932.png"></p>
<p>There are also some players whose gaming experience looks very complicated, and their gaming time seems to be very heavy. But once you ask carefully, you will feel that they do not have clear game preferences, and even their understanding of gameplay is not like that of a game player. Their words and deeds are always contradictory, so that it is difficult for you to classify them as any type of player in the above player model. These players are likely to regard games as social activities. They play games mainly influenced by friends around them, in order not to be out of touch with people around them. What they value is being able to play with friends around them, not the game itself. It is not difficult to understand why the games they choose are often very different; if you delve too much into their evaluation of a certain game, you will fall into a trap.</p>
<p>The MMO player exemplified above represents a large group of game players, that is, those who desire to escape from daily life. They may have the need to relieve pressure, and interesting game environments and low game thresholds are easy to attract them; they may also have unique emotional needs, wanting to find social connections in the game, or find their lost selves, so they pay more attention to whether the game is humane, rather than the quality of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F71702ff0-c797-4bdc-8228-24782c3acf36.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;71702ff0-c797-4bdc-8228-24782c3acf36.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-How-to-Talk-to-Players-About-Life"><a href="#4-How-to-Talk-to-Players-About-Life" class="headerlink" title="4. How to Talk to Players About Life"></a>4. How to Talk to Players About Life</h2><p>In the research, we found that the life status of players is a very difficult topic to talk about. Many players are reluctant to expose too much of their personal information in the research. In the actual operation process, the tips we use include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give players an opportunity to introduce themselves. A player who is willing to communicate with you about daily life will inadvertently reveal more of himself, and then you can follow his words to ask more potential information.</li>
<li>Ask about the player’s life status at the right time instead of asking directly. For example, when talking about the player’s views on daily activities, you can take the opportunity to understand whether the player’s life status is busy, and how much weight the game has in his life.</li>
<li>Communicate with players like a friend and give appropriate self-disclosure. Qualified user researchers should not express their own attitudes too much, as this may induce players, but there is no need to be a robot. Appropriate reactions will make players feel that they have met a game enthusiast and are more willing to communicate with you. More content will not be repeated here, and we will expand on it in the next article.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, all human behavior is motivated. We cannot talk about a player’s game behavior without his daily life, and we cannot talk about what is wrong with the game without the player himself. Player research itself is a big topic. Perhaps only by truly understanding the player’s life status and attitude towards life can we see the living players through the fog.</p>

    <title>It&#39;s Just Simple Elimination, Why Is It So Addictive?</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220628/28584_1026680.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-Match-3-Games-and-Their-Brief-History"><a href="#1-Match-3-Games-and-Their-Brief-History" class="headerlink" title="1. Match-3 Games and Their Brief History"></a>1. Match-3 Games and Their Brief History</h2><p>Elimination games are a type of puzzle game where players mainly win by matching and eliminating a certain number of identical game elements, such as fruits, gems, animal heads, building blocks, mahjong tiles, etc., so that they are adjacent to each other. Usually, three identical elements are matched and eliminated, so this type is also called “match-3 games”. Some match-3 games will add a development&#x2F;story, or management line on top of the elimination gameplay. Players obtain items through winning the elimination gameplay, and use them to upgrade buildings, improve character stats, etc.</p>
<p><em>Tetris</em> should be the earliest ancestor of elimination games, and <em>Dr. Mario</em>, later released by Nintendo after <em>Tetris</em>, can be said to be the prototype of match-3 type games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F887a0cc4-4973-4562-9b4a-c158f1206865.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;887a0cc4-4973-4562-9b4a-c158f1206865.png"></p>
<p>After that, games like <em>Bejeweled</em> and <em>Zuma</em> were released one after another. Richer elimination rules, gorgeous elimination feedback, and realistic elimination sound effects made the two games successful worldwide, pushing the match-3 game genre to the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F5a0d5792-25cb-4ccd-b16c-12541a63e20a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;5a0d5792-25cb-4ccd-b16c-12541a63e20a.png"></p>
<p>To this day, match-3 games have occupied a stable position in both domestic and foreign markets. In the “2021 China Game Industry Report” released by the China Game Industry Research Institute, elimination games accounted for about 4% of the market share of the top 100 mobile games by revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F2e5d54d9-9c08-4db9-b55a-3cdf96b31bed.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;2e5d54d9-9c08-4db9-b55a-3cdf96b31bed.png"></p>
<p>Overseas, elimination games have always occupied an important position in the mobile game best-selling list. According to DoF data, the global puzzle game market reached US$5.1 billion in 2020, of which elimination games accounted for US$3.76 billion (excluding China, Japan, and South Korea). Especially in the United States, elimination games are the largest segment of its mobile game market, and they are also an important region for domestic elimination game manufacturers to go overseas. According to GameRefinery data, elimination games accounted for 21% and 16% of the revenue of the US iOS game market in 2020 and May 2021, respectively. Among the Top 100 games on the US iOS best-selling list, elimination games account for about 15 games, among which King, Playrix, and Zynga, several major elimination game manufacturers, have occupied the main positions all year round.</p>

<h2 id="King’s-series-of-elimination-casual-games"><a href="#King’s-series-of-elimination-casual-games" class="headerlink" title="King’s series of elimination&#x2F;casual games"></a><em>King’s series of elimination&#x2F;casual games</em></h2><p>The core gameplay of match-3 games is actually not complicated, but the love of people all over the world for them can span decades. It seems that it will continue to be popular for decades to come. Why is it so attractive? We try to find some answers from the perspective of psychological mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="2-Elimination-Gameplay-Unit-Easy-to-Obtain-Instant-Reinforcement"><a href="#2-Elimination-Gameplay-Unit-Easy-to-Obtain-Instant-Reinforcement" class="headerlink" title="2. Elimination Gameplay Unit: Easy-to-Obtain Instant Reinforcement"></a>2. Elimination Gameplay Unit: Easy-to-Obtain Instant Reinforcement</h2><p>No matter how old the elimination game is, it always has several steps: “gathering the same color through operation (filling the same row in Tetris)”, “eliminating the same color blocks (the same row)”, and “increasing the score&#x2F;scoring numbers”, forming the smallest gameplay unit of the elimination game, and the process of the game is to constantly repeat this action. Every time you complete a gameplay unit, the game will give audio and visual prompts, such as the elimination animation and score display in the picture. Visually, the stacking of the same color naturally conforms to human perceptual fluency preferences, which will bring a sense of neatness and comfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fc102cfd2-1230-4109-a827-e72189391bfe.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;c102cfd2-1230-4109-a827-e72189391bfe.png"></p>
<p>While the elimination action is in progress, the game system will generate sound effects such as “great”, characters, and scores. In human culture, these all represent praise and are very direct positive feedback. In the current popular elimination games, there are even combo settings (the more you repeat the elimination action, the higher the score brought by the combo), and there are various functional blocks, which are more gorgeous and exaggerated in the effect of elimination, and can bring more attractive visual feedback. Even the remaining steps after each elimination round will have a fancy score settlement performance. All of them have increased the feedback after the elimination action, doubling the player’s pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F805611f4-3c48-4511-9587-d5bbe6c4a865.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;805611f4-3c48-4511-9587-d5bbe6c4a865.png"></p>
<p>From the perspective of psychological mechanisms, each elimination gameplay unit is a positive reinforcement - you make an action, and then immediately get a pleasant experience. Theoretical research on positive reinforcement has found that when people take a certain action, they can get a certain pleasant result from others, and this result in turn becomes a force to promote people to tend to or repeat this action. This is the basic principle of the core gameplay of elimination, which seems simple, but you always want to continue.</p>
<h2 id="3-Randomness-The-Joy-Written-in-the-Genes"><a href="#3-Randomness-The-Joy-Written-in-the-Genes" class="headerlink" title="3. Randomness: The Joy Written in the Genes"></a>3. Randomness: The Joy Written in the Genes</h2><p>Most elimination games, on top of the pleasant unit of elimination, have superimposed a layer of human’s joyful addiction written in the genes - randomness. In elimination games, the block matrix given to you at the beginning of each round is random, and the sequence of blocks that fall from above after elimination is also random. When you are lucky, you can randomly get some functional blocks at the beginning. For example, colored candies that can eliminate all blocks of the same color, striped blocks that can eliminate the entire row&#x2F;column, and coloring candies that can collectively change the color of blocks of a certain color. These props will reduce the difficulty of passing the level to varying degrees. When you are lucky, you can encounter a king-bomb opening - two adjacent colored candies. After they move each other, there will be a full-screen elimination effect, and you can even pass the level with full stars in one step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2Fb6f6c4a6-bbea-4acd-af2a-8986dce6219f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;b6f6c4a6-bbea-4acd-af2a-8986dce6219f.png"></p>
<p>This kind of random and unfixed experience is more addictive than fixed feedback. This effect is called intermittent reinforcement in psychology. Psychologist Skinner conducted a reinforcement experiment on rats. He designed a lever. As long as the rat stepped on the lever, food would fall. In the experimental group with constant food delivery, when the experimenter no longer delivered food and the rat did not get food by pressing the button, the rat’s established behavior habit would quickly disappear. In another control experiment, the experimenter changed the appearance mechanism of food to random dropping, and the rat also learned to keep pressing the button. Even if it takes dozens of uncertain presses to drop a piece of food, the rat will still maintain this behavior habit for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F14dc21f3-83a4-4ca7-bf1b-c52479b5caa8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;14dc21f3-83a4-4ca7-bf1b-c52479b5caa8.png"></p>
<p>This phenomenon is related to the mechanism of action of the brain’s reward mechanism. During the evolution of mankind, the brain has evolved a set of reward mechanisms that can associate certain situations with pleasure. In this way, we tend to try situations that may produce this experience again in the future from those learnings. The important substance in this is a neurotransmitter called “dopamine”, which is related to the mechanism of finding, searching, and judging that something can bring you happiness. Simply put, the role of dopamine is to “make you want” and let you choose behaviors that can get more rewards. The amount of dopamine has little to do with the amount of happiness after actually getting the result. Its main role is to make us have desires, thereby guiding corresponding behaviors.</p>
<p>After people’s behavior, the pleasant result obtained strengthens people’s expectation for the next behavior, and the intensity of this expectation is controlled by dopamine. When randomness is introduced, the player’s expectation is the randomly appearing reinforcement. When the player accidentally realizes an expectation, he will then crave the next realization, and so on. In this process, our nervous system will constantly predict the relationship between the current behavior and the next moment’s reward. When this prediction deviates, the brain will secrete dopamine to let all the neurons that make predictions change their expectations. In experiments, people found that the degree of dopamine secretion caused by “almost winning&#x2F;getting” is only slightly lower than that of “really winning&#x2F;getting”, which shows that human expectations and motivation for the next behavior are not completely one-to-one positively correlated with the result of the current behavior. “Almost winning&#x2F;getting” provides uncertain guidance for people, thereby continuously strengthening players’ behavior.</p>
<p>Simply put, before the result of randomness appears, people often have expectations for the result, and this expectation will accumulate with the increase of behavior. When expectations are realized, compared with certain results, uncertainty will make people secrete more dopamine, making you have a stronger desire, which will make the feedback mechanism more firmly strengthened.</p>
<p>Substituting into the smallest gameplay unit of elimination, after each sliding operation, we will get a block layout after elimination, but due to the randomness of the blocks falling from above, the block layout obtained after elimination is an uncertain event for us. Compared with the certain result of each sliding operation, the expectation that the next sliding operation can get powerful functional blocks will give us a stronger motivation to perform the next operation.</p>
<h2 id="4-Stamina-Restrictions-Avoiding-Desensitization-Caused-by-Hedonic-Adaptation"><a href="#4-Stamina-Restrictions-Avoiding-Desensitization-Caused-by-Hedonic-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="4. Stamina Restrictions: Avoiding Desensitization Caused by Hedonic Adaptation"></a>4. Stamina Restrictions: Avoiding Desensitization Caused by Hedonic Adaptation</h2><p>Players who often play elimination games will find that most elimination games have stamina restrictions. These stamina may recover one grid every 10 minutes, or one grid every 30 minutes. Every time you fail to pass a level, one grid of stamina will be deducted. After all stamina is deducted, you can no longer continue to pass the level. Of course, you can also continue to get the opportunity to pass the level by purchasing stamina. Every time the stamina is exhausted, we always feel itchy and want to say if we can play another round. When the game occasionally releases some unlimited stamina props for a limited time of 2 hours, you often find that you are getting more and more bored, without the excitement when the stamina was limited before, and become a mechanical elimination tool person. You can’t play for 2 hours of unlimited stamina at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220628%2F67891715-84d1-499d-b2bf-b8887e051b0a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220628&#x2F;67891715-84d1-499d-b2bf-b8887e051b0a.png"></p>
<p>However, in this process, the excitement of the game has not changed, what has changed is your perception of the happiness of the game. This phenomenon is called hedonic adaptation. We can get happiness from doing something at the beginning, but as the number of times we do this thing increases, the happiness we feel each time will increase our expectations for the next time, and the next time we will need a greater intensity of experience to get the same level of happiness as before. When the elimination game brings happiness, the brain will secrete dopamine, making people look forward to continuing to eliminate the game and keeping people excited. When a stimulus is continuously input, the brain will continue to secrete dopamine. When dopamine-sending cells continuously pump out dopamine, the receiving nerve cells will cover their “ears” and reduce dopamine receptors (D2). This is the desensitization process that occurs in our brains, making people less desirous of a continuous stimulus. Of course, this is only a temporary desensitization. After a period of CD, the game will still make us feel happy. The stamina restriction in the game will interrupt people’s adaptation process to the happiness of the elimination gameplay, making the new game experience after full blood more valuable.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>This article only attempts to analyze the smallest gameplay unit in elimination games - the elimination level, and analyze the attractiveness of this category of gameplay from a psychological mechanism perspective for readers: the elimination behavior naturally conforms to human cognitive fluency preferences, and each elimination behavior unit is an instant reinforcement feedback; the ubiquitous randomness in the level strengthens people’s motivation for experience; the setting of limiting stamina reduces the hedonic adaptation brought by repeated fun. Of course, in addition to the above designs, elimination games also have a large number of elements such as scores, stars, and even development to increase the fun of the game, making the game more playable and longer-lasting.</p>

    <title>From &#39;Raising Pets&#39; to &#39;Raising Children&#39;: Analyzing the Child-Rearing Gameplay in MMO Games</title>
    <url>/2022/06/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20220629_28584_1027138/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220629/28584_1027138.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, we often see all kinds of complaints about “raising children” online: being too tired from working during the day and taking care of children at night, being driven to tears when tutoring children, and so on. These complaints invisibly make people feel very stressed about “raising children”.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to reality, “raising children in games” has been praised and favored by many players. In many MMORPG games, in order to promote player interaction, the game will solidify the emotional bond between players through the relationship (情缘 - qíng yuán) system. The child-rearing system is the “next stage” of the relationship system. It is built on in-depth player interaction and the emotional foundation of relationship players, bringing a lot of fun to the player’s game life.</p>
<p>Similar to reality, raising a child in the game is not a simple matter. In order to make players qualified parents, every player who wants to have a baby needs to pass an entrance exam to obtain the qualification to raise a child; during the pregnancy and raising process, players need to take care of the child every day and interact with the child; and after the child grows up , Players also need to supervise their children’s learning every day to improve various numerical dimensions.</p>
<p>We can see that in order to raise children, players not only need to log in to the game frequently, but also need to complete different tasks in order to take care of their children. However, even if it is so “hard”, players are still keen to “raise children” in the game. From “raising pets” to “raising children”, this kind of gameplay system with nurturing elements frequently appears in many games. Some players use them as a reflection of their inner emotions, and some will use them as an outlet for their own emotional expression. This article will further analyze the parenting gameplay in MMO games from the following aspects.</p>
<h2 id="1-Simulated-Nurturing"><a href="#1-Simulated-Nurturing" class="headerlink" title="1. Simulated Nurturing"></a>1. Simulated Nurturing</h2><p>With the enrichment of game play, the design of the parenting system in MMO games is very realistic, and the entire process of pregnancy and raising can bring a strong sense of immersion. In addition to the content mentioned earlier, players need to complete daily tasks to bring experience growth to their children. Different stages of children’s growth will also have different body types and appearances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F28b5dc1f-9bcd-4d50-a3ff-51cbc381e35a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;28b5dc1f-9bcd-4d50-a3ff-51cbc381e35a.png"></p>
<p>For example, in <em>Justice Online</em>, parents can arrange for their children to complete different courses every day, such as “going to Liyun Pavilion to listen to operas”, “going to the academy to study”, “raising flowers and plants”, etc. Correspondingly, after completing the courses, players can improve attributes of charm, intelligence, character, etc.. Because the child’s energy is limited every day, the number of courses completed is also limited, so parents need to choose and arrange courses according to their own ideas. This is like in reality, parents need to choose which subjects, such as language, mathematics, English, etc., to tutor their children according to their weaknesses.</p>
<p>After the child grows up, the child will not only repay the parents by helping them complete tasks, but also travel, and bring back travel photos of himself in different scenes to the parents. Maybe he met a little frog by the pond, or maybe he was chased by a dog named “Wangcai” (旺财 - wàng cái: a common name for dogs, literally “Prosperous Wealth”) by the road. Imagine that when parents see the bits and pieces of their children’s journey shared with them, they will definitely have a full sense of happiness.</p>

<p>In this process, players can obtain a real baby-raising experience at a lower cost, thereby obtaining the pleasure of nurturing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Projecting-Oneself"><a href="#2-Projecting-Oneself" class="headerlink" title="2. Projecting Oneself"></a>2. Projecting Oneself</h2><p>Compared with competitive gameplay that focuses more on operation and a sense of accomplishment, the parenting system in MMO games can provide players with a reflection of their own ideals and a proof of their emotional investment.</p>
<p>In reality, parents often project their expectations of their children onto their children. This is reflected in the fact that parents will expect their children to become what they want them to be through their own education methods.</p>
<p>In <em>Justice Online</em>, each baby will have exclusive personality tags (such as outgoing, introverted, naughty, etc.). Personality traits will be reflected in the daily interaction between the baby and the parents. Parents can also set personalized face customization and outfits for the baby according to their own preferences. Therefore, every baby is unique. In addition to personality, babies in the game will also have their own body types (such as burly, strong, petite, slender, etc.). In the process of “raising” children, players can raise a “baby” that meets their expectations according to their ideal settings, and can also obtain happiness and satisfaction other than upgrades.</p>
<p>Parents improve the baby’s values in various dimensions by giving gifts, chatting and other interactive forms, as well as taking classes, thereby projecting their expectations of the baby. And when the parents’ expectations are met, the parents’ sense of happiness and superiority will also be nourished.</p>

<h2 id="3-Warm-Companionship"><a href="#3-Warm-Companionship" class="headerlink" title="3. Warm Companionship"></a>3. Warm Companionship</h2><p>In games, the use of AI is very common, including the parenting system. A powerful AI system can allow babies to give playful feedback to different chat content sent by parents, allowing players to obtain psychological comfort through the company of their children in a boring life. Many players will chat with their babies when they are free and bored. If they encounter interesting conversations, they will also take screenshots and share them on social platforms. This not only provides a sense of companionship in conversations with the child you raised yourself, but also a great outlet for emotions when sharing with game friends&#x2F;real-life friends.</p>
<p>In various games, there are actually many players who are “socially phobic”. They will feel that socializing with other players is troublesome or stressful, but when facing their own baby, this pressure disappears. Through such companionship, “socially phobic” players can also have fun playing alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F1deea576-6975-4c2b-a786-24ed8c581c67.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;1deea576-6975-4c2b-a786-24ed8c581c67.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Picture: Players晒(shài - show off&#x2F;share) their conversations with their children on the Tieba (贴吧 - a Chinese online forum)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the parenting system of <em>Justice Online</em> was launched, many players would communicate with their “babies” in various ways, finding more companionship in this kind of casual and nurturing gameplay; many players also shared their daily baby-raising life on platforms such as Tieba and Dashen (大神 - a game community platform), communicating interesting stories experienced during the parenting process with friends, and recording the growth of their children. This is actually the same as parents in reality going crazy showing off their babies on WeChat Moments.</p>
<h2 id="4-Intimate-Social-Interaction"><a href="#4-Intimate-Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="4. Intimate Social Interaction"></a>4. Intimate Social Interaction</h2><p>The connection between the parenting system and the relationship system is very close. Although single players can also adopt children in the game, many players have children together after forming a relationship between the opposite sex. In the process of raising children with their game partner, players can also strengthen their intimate relationship. Because raising children can add more topics between partners and bring more companionship to each other.</p>
<p>In the game, both parents can often complete parenting tasks together, and there will be no tasks that can only be completed by the father or the mother. In this process, players need to arrange the parenting of their children according to their own daily situation, and at the same time, they also need to discuss the parenting direction of their children together. This is very important for promoting social interaction between relationship partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F3ba0b671-cdd8-4762-af11-99d34e756245.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;3ba0b671-cdd8-4762-af11-99d34e756245.png"></p>
<h2 id="5-Ordinary-Social-Interaction"><a href="#5-Ordinary-Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="5. Ordinary Social Interaction"></a>5. Ordinary Social Interaction</h2><p>In addition to intimate social interaction between relationship partners, players can also use children as a topic to establish social relationships with other parents. Social interaction has always been an extremely important element of MMORPG games, and it plays an important role in maintaining players’ relationship networks and creating game topics. As one of the derivative gameplays of MMO games, the parenting system can establish another important social field between “parents” in addition to fixed teams, guilds, PVP arenas, etc.</p>
<p>In the daily tasks of the parenting system, the game will set some tasks related to social interaction with children, such as playing with other children. In order to complete these tasks, parents also need to find friends for their children, which actually promotes social interaction between players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fc17effd7-8858-4617-b18c-81c022f5d1b2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;c17effd7-8858-4617-b18c-81c022f5d1b2.png"></p>
<p>In addition, the game will also design exclusive play scenes for children (actually also for adults), such as amusement parks. These scenes generally have interactive props, such as seesaws, merry-go-rounds, etc. Players can play with their children. In these scenes, parents can not only interact with their children, but also interact with other parents, thereby establishing social relationships.</p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The parenting system has gradually become one of the “essential systems” of MMO games. In some games, the parenting system will be tied to numerical growth, and players will also raise children in order to improve their combat power. But for most players, raising children is to be able to obtain a real baby-raising experience in the game world. I believe that the parenting system in the game will continue to be optimized in the future, bringing players a more realistic sense of nurturing.</p>

    <title>Gamification Design, More Than Just Design That Looks Like a Game</title>
    <url>/2022/04/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20220629_28584_1027154/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220629/28584_1027154.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>

<h2 id="1-Conceptual-Elaboration"><a href="#1-Conceptual-Elaboration" class="headerlink" title="1. Conceptual Elaboration"></a>1. Conceptual Elaboration</h2><h3 id="Gamification-Definition"><a href="#Gamification-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Definition"></a>Gamification Definition</h3><p>The common definition of gamification is the application of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts to change people’s inherent behavior patterns. The most popular gamification in China, for example, simply copies the game’s system, regardless of whether it is suitable for the current theme or whether it is fun. Simply adding points, badges&#x2F;achievement systems, and leaderboards (i.e., the PBL system) applies the shell of the game to the themed activity. But this can only be called a game-like product that utilizes the external presentation of the game, falling into the narrow cognitive misunderstanding of gamification. In essence, gamification should not be just a simple application of the game framework to various scenarios. Gamification design should be a way of thinking, empowering non-gamified scenarios or industries through the core driving force of the game, allowing users to gain more fun and create greater value in the process of experience.</p>
<h3 id="Gamification-Elements"><a href="#Gamification-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Gamification Elements"></a>Gamification Elements</h3><p>The elements that make up gamification are diverse. From the perspective of their role in the gamification system, they can be divided into three categories: dynamics, mechanics, and components. They are arranged according to the degree of abstraction to form the DMC pyramid. At the bottom of the DMC pyramid of gamification elements are basic components, such as achievements, badges, and other elements, which are the specific manifestations of dynamics and mechanics. Above the components, mechanics, including chance, competition, and cooperation, are the basic processes that drive game progress and user participation. The top layer is dynamics, which is the driving force for users to use gamified products.</p>
<p>Various components form complex rules under the guidance of mechanics, and a complete gamification system is formed due to the drive of dynamic elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F1efd3c1c-40ce-4fef-8527-29aa85853629.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;1efd3c1c-40ce-4fef-8527-29aa85853629.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1: DMC Pyramid of Gamification Elements</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting from the DMC pyramid for gamification design can provide some guidance, but it is easy to fall into the design misunderstanding of completing gamification only through components such as achievement leaderboards and coins.</p>
<h2 id="2-Gamification-Design"><a href="#2-Gamification-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Gamification Design"></a>2. Gamification Design</h2><p>How to break the simple game shell and empower gamification design? The Octalysis framework provides a core guiding framework.</p>
<p>Octalysis is a framework in gamification design. The core tenet is the “human-centered” design concept, not function-centered. It is composed of eight core drives. According to the different characteristics of the drives, they can be divided into: left-brain drives and right-brain drives, white hat gamification and black hat gamification. Left and right brain drives can be understood as extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Left-brain core drives often rely on extrinsic motivation, while right-brain core drives are mostly intrinsic motivation.</p>

<h3 id="Gamification-in-Service-Design"><a href="#Gamification-in-Service-Design" class="headerlink" title="Gamification in Service Design"></a>Gamification in Service Design</h3><p>The radiotherapy ward of the Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing University is a place that provides tumor treatment for adults and children in Southwest China. The hospital originally used standardized decoration, with pale wards, cold instruments, and the symptoms of adults’ illnesses, all bringing unknown fear to the children. After understanding the situation of the entire ward and the children’s treatment process, the designer transformed it into a “healing planet” for children.</p>
<p>The orange and warm white tones make the ordinary wards no longer cold, and elements of the IP world are also added to the medical area, running through the entire space. For example, after opening the glass door with 28 totems printed on it with a special bracelet, you can see the “little monsters” hidden in the plants at the entrance to greet the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fddd0aa8e-6ad9-49f2-97b2-35d1b3a325c4.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;ddd0aa8e-6ad9-49f2-97b2-35d1b3a325c4.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3: Transformed Ward of Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing University - 1</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The designer also added push-rod interactive devices and game areas to the renovation, relying on this approach to build a bridge for communication between parents and children, playing a role in mutual comfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F62e7e8e4-415a-4bca-8781-384fa5d7dccd.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;62e7e8e4-415a-4bca-8781-384fa5d7dccd.gif"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5: Transformed Ward of Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing University - 3</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From the perspective of the Octalysis framework, the transformation adds two drives, “social influence &amp; relatedness” and “unpredictability &amp; curiosity”, to the medical service. Under the premise of fully considering the needs of patients and their families, through the design of spatial flow, hardware and soft decoration design, and interactive device design, the fun of the medical process is increased, the curiosity of children is stimulated, and the social connection between patients and their families is strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="NetEase-Cloud-Music-Gamified-Marketing"><a href="#NetEase-Cloud-Music-Gamified-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="NetEase Cloud Music Gamified Marketing"></a>NetEase Cloud Music Gamified Marketing</h3><p>On May 26, 2021, NetEase Cloud Music and its partners launched a test. Users can test their personality color by listening to music and making choices, and can also share the test link to Moments, WeChat friends, social media, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F20b5dc34-f3aa-4b3e-a6a6-a03afa9ac030.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;20b5dc34-f3aa-4b3e-a6a6-a03afa9ac030.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 6: NetEase Cloud Personality Main Color Test Poster</em></p>
<hr>
<p>NetEase Cloud Music’s gamified marketing utilizes multiple drives to attract users, with “scarcity &amp; impatience” as the core and “social influence &amp; relatedness” as the boost, achieving a surge in public opinion. In the shared pictures and texts, you can see descriptions such as “In China, one out of every xx people will like you” and “Your characteristics”. The copywriting satisfies users’ desire for the uniqueness of their personal personality color, expresses recognition and affirmation of users’ own existence, and at the same time, according to the test results, it can be used to find people who match their own color and promote social relationships.</p>
<h3 id="Digital-Therapeutics-Prescription-Drug"><a href="#Digital-Therapeutics-Prescription-Drug" class="headerlink" title="Digital Therapeutics Prescription Drug"></a>Digital Therapeutics Prescription Drug</h3><p>EndeavorRx (AKL-T01) is a video game designed to improve attention and is the first digital therapeutic device designed to improve symptoms associated with ADHD (Attention Deficit&#x2F;Hyperactivity Disorder) that has received FDA (Food and Drug Administration) prescription drug approval certification. Unlike other video games played by children, the therapeutic procedures in the game are scientifically designed to challenge children’s brains during the treatment process while requiring children’s attention to be focused on multiple tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2F05c7557b-0eac-41da-83a6-a4c130be798f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;05c7557b-0eac-41da-83a6-a4c130be798f.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 7: EndeavorRx Promotional Poster</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This game is mainly suitable for children aged 8-12 years with inattention or combined-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can improve the attention of these children. As part of the treatment, combined with other clinical, drug, and educational treatments, it will improve the related symptoms of children with ADHD.</p>
<p>Digital therapeutics prescription drugs are mainly guided by the two major drives of “development &amp; accomplishment” and “empowerment of creativity &amp; feedback”. Curiosity attracts children to play the game, and defeating challenges in the game obtains positive feedback, ultimately achieving the goal of improving attention.</p>
<p>However, although this will allow children to receive treatment faster than taking medicine, children with ADHD will become increasingly addicted to the game. In the trial, a few subjects even experienced side effects such as frustration, headache, dizziness, emotional reaction, nausea, or aggression. The occurrence of this side effect can be explained using the flow model.</p>
<p>Flow Model: Establish a coordinate system with personal skills as the X-axis and event challenges as the Y-axis to establish a flow model. When an individual’s skills are close to the challenges of the events they encounter, they will enter a state of flow. For the gaming industry, when a player’s skills are higher than the challenges presented by the game, the player will feel bored; and when the player’s skills are lower than the challenges presented by the game, the player will fall into anxiety. And the greater the gap between skills and the challenges presented by the game, the more obvious this feeling is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Fb1becdde-b5e4-4b22-8cdf-d855acfbe2b5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;b1becdde-b5e4-4b22-8cdf-d855acfbe2b5.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 8: Flow Experience Model</em></p>
<hr>
<p>During the digital treatment process of children, if the challenges in the game are higher than the skills they can achieve, side effects such as nausea will occur. Not only EndeavorRx, but all games used as digital therapeutics prescription drugs should have a difficulty level closer to the level of the target player group, so that the recipients can stay in the flow state for as long as possible, maintain enthusiasm for the game, and achieve therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220629%2Ff75d004b-417c-4bed-b77c-fc2aace91b94.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220629&#x2F;f75d004b-417c-4bed-b77c-fc2aace91b94.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 9: EndeavorRx Game Interface</em></p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Gamification is one of the most widely used methods in design. The rational use of game elements can solve problems in user experience or achieve explosive marketing effects. But no matter what kind of presentation form is adopted, it is only a means of construction. The core of gamification is to promote user participation, and the fundamental purpose is always to make users feel interesting, thereby stimulating their drive.</p>

    <title>Designing for the Keyboard Operation Experience of Players in Different Languages</title>
    <url>/2022/05/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20220629_28584_1027161/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220629/28584_1027161.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a normal weekend, have those of you planning to spend the day playing games ever suddenly wondered why the keys on the keyboard are not arranged in the order of ABCD? The keyboard we commonly use, with the first six letters of the first row being Q, W, E, R, T, Y, has also become the source of its name, the QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard family has many other unusual layouts aside from QWERTY.</p>
<p>With the principle of learning from our questions, today we will learn some obscure facts about keyboards, and the considerations for keyboard layout when designing the user experience of games. At the end of the article, we will provide several keyboard localization experience design solutions for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="1-QWERTY-a-Product-of-the-Typewriter-Era"><a href="#1-QWERTY-a-Product-of-the-Typewriter-Era" class="headerlink" title="1. QWERTY, a Product of the Typewriter Era"></a>1. QWERTY, a Product of the Typewriter Era</h2><p>To understand why today’s keyboards look the way they do, we need to trace back to the typewriter era. That’s right, the keyboard was introduced much earlier than the first computer, which appeared in the 1940s. In the early 19th century, people had already started using keyboards, but the keyboard initially adopted a layout with 26 letters arranged in a single row.</p>
<p>However, this terrible design was too inefficient. Some letter combinations obviously required typists to have advanced fingering skills to reach. So, apart from the inventor himself, few people used the world’s first typewriter keyboard. Soon after, new design solutions emerged to replace the original keyboard.</p>
<p>The person who eventually invented the familiar QWERTY keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes. There are two completely opposite versions of the story of his invention of QWERTY. One theory is that early typewriters would inadvertently speed up as people used them. If two adjacent letters were struck quickly, the two connecting rods would easily collide and jam. Sholes chose to separate the letters into discontinuous arrangements to reduce the typing speed of typists, thereby reducing the occurrence of failures. The other version says that Sholes observed that typists often had continuous keystrokes with one hand. When one hand was inputting frantically, the other was idle. The hand with continuous keystrokes was prone to fatigue and reduced speed. Sholes hoped to improve typing efficiency by alternating between left and right hands when typing.</p>

Sholes deliberately separated common letter combinations such as TH, HE, AN, IN, ON, AT, ND, ST, but also designed the ER accelerator key combination, and moved the commonly used letter T to the center and the less commonly used key Q to the edge.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happened in the past, such a seemingly strange and incomprehensible keyboard was born and continues to this day, becoming the most commonly used keyboard in our lives with the mysterious aura of one of the world’s top 100 unsolved mysteries.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-Else-is-There-Besides-QWERTY"><a href="#2-What-Else-is-There-Besides-QWERTY" class="headerlink" title="2. What Else is There Besides QWERTY?"></a>2. What Else is There Besides QWERTY?</h2><p>If you look closely at our keyboard, you will find that in addition to English letters and commonly used special characters, most characters of other languages cannot be typed normally. If you want to communicate with other friends in the global village, you need to use some minor language keyboards, which are usually redesigned on the basis of the QWERTY keyboard.</p>
<p>In addition to QWERTY, there are also minor language keyboards such as QWERTZ, AZERTY, and new keyboards such as Dvorak.</p>
<p>Take the French keyboard as an example. Compared with the universal QWERTY keyboard, in addition to letting the number keys also undertake the output tasks of vowels such as é, è, ç, à, the French keyboard also swaps the positions of A and Q, W and Z, and M comes to the right of L. Such changes may be due to the frequency of use of different letters. In French, the letters Q and Z appear more frequently than A and W. Choosing this arrangement can make finger movement more convenient and faster.</p>

<h2 id="Korean-keyboard"><a href="#Korean-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Korean keyboard"></a><em>Korean keyboard</em></h2><p>In the years that QWERTY has dominated the market, many people have also tried to improve the keyboard layout. After all, the design of the QWERTY keyboard is not perfect. When using it, the left hand undertakes 14% more workload than the right hand (no wonder the author’s left hand always aches faintly when typing), and the usage rate of the middle row of letters is only 32%.</p>
<p>The most famous of these new keyboards is the Dvorak, born in 1936, and named after its designer, August Dvorak. The Dvorak keyboard reconsiders the frequency of English letters. All vowels are listed on the left and commonly used consonants are listed on the right, assigning 56% of the typing load to the right hand. It also utilizes the middle row that QWERTY abandoned, making the usage rate reach 70%.</p>

Keyboard Localized User Game Experience Design</h2><p>For players who use the QWERTY keyboard, using WASD to represent up, down, left, and right movement is already the default. But after learning the knowledge points above, we will find something is wrong. It is too unreasonable to require players who use minor language keyboards to adapt to WASD! We have compiled the following keyboard localization experience design solutions:</p>
<h3 id="Players-Manually-Reset-Keyboard-Keys"><a href="#Players-Manually-Reset-Keyboard-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Players Manually Reset Keyboard Keys"></a>Players Manually Reset Keyboard Keys</h3><p>Fortunately, most games today support user-defined keys in the key settings. Not only can minor language players adjust the key settings that best suit their keyboard layout, but some professional e-sports players or players who pursue higher skills can also adjust a set of personal optimal key combinations. For example, overseas players can set appropriate keys through custom keys when playing Naraka: Bladepoint. This degree of freedom has solved the problem of conflicting keyboard layouts to a certain extent, but just like Dvorak’s improvement to QWERTY, the improvement of the keyboard world has never stopped, and game designers are also seeking an optimal solution.</p>

<h2 id="1-Overview-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#1-Overview-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of Game Localization"></a>1. Overview of Game Localization</h2><p>With the continuous development of technology, the ways people choose to spend their leisure time have also greatly increased. Today, digital games (i.e., various games designed and developed using digital technology and implemented on digital devices) have many followers almost all over the world, and they no longer belong only to the language and culture in which they are released. Thanks to game localization, many games have been translated into other languages to reach more players.</p>
<p>Through game localization translation, the game is fully adapted to the culture of the target language and is driven by the history and stories of that culture. Game translation is constantly evolving in this field and has become more important with the increase of e-sports enthusiasts, but it can only achieve its main purpose when it is carried out by qualified and experienced translators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2Fcd18bae6-6476-4998-b2da-91882e226806.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;cd18bae6-6476-4998-b2da-91882e226806.png"></p>
<h2 id="2-General-Characteristics-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#2-General-Characteristics-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="2. General Characteristics of Game Localization"></a>2. General Characteristics of Game Localization</h2><p>After games entered our lives with the production of computers and mobile phones, they also created a huge global market. Especially in terms of text translation, professional language talents are needed, so the concept of game localization has emerged. An important reason why professional language talents are needed is that each game has a unique structure, special terminology, and scenarios.  Localization can transform special terms and “introduced” things to match the local cultural background, eliminate cultural barriers brought by “introduced” products, and ultimately meet the needs of local customers and realize the market value of products.</p>
<p>Localization mainly includes two basic aspects, one is text translation, and the other is cultural exchange beyond text translation. Cultural exchange includes language, culture, customs, and habits. Localization is equal to text translation plus cultural adaptation. Localization has a certain degree of adaptation and redesign space for the translated text. While making the translation close to the original text, it can also reflect the distinctive cultural characteristics of the region.</p>
<p>In the game <em>League of Legends</em>, the English names of Rakan and Xayah are “The Charmer” and “The Rebel”, respectively. In the Chinese server, “The Charmer” is translated as “幻翎” (Huàn Líng).  “幻” (Huàn) corresponds to the literal translation of the English title, and “翎” (Líng) refers to a type of feather, which matches the appearance characteristics of the hero. “The Rebel” is translated as “逆羽” (Nì Yǔ). “逆” (Nì) reflects the hero’s rebelliousness, and “羽” (Yǔ) means “feather”, the weapon used by the hero. “翎” (Líng) and “羽” (Yǔ) correspond to each other, and “洛” (Luò) and “霞” (Xiá) are taken from Wang Bo’s “Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng” - “落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色” (Falling rosy clouds fly together with a lone wild duck, and the autumn water shares the same color with the vast sky). Through flexible translation, the communicative purpose is achieved without affecting the player’s gaming experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Skills-to-Master-for-Game-Localization"><a href="#3-Skills-to-Master-for-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3. Skills to Master for Game Localization"></a>3. Skills to Master for Game Localization</h2><p>Every game contains a variety of dialogues, songs, literary texts, word games, and references to the source culture. When all these elements cannot be fully translated into the target language, the gaming experience is negatively affected. To avoid this negative situation, you should first be familiar with different types of text when localizing games. At the same time, it is extremely important to keep up with the constantly changing game terminology. It is equally important that the localization team understands the trends that are rapidly spreading among players and the ever-changing and evolving technology. Especially in online games involving many players, the player community creates their own jargon, an online language.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, developed by NetEase’s 24 Entertainment and supported by Leihuo UX, the game takes place on an island called “Morus Isle” (聚窟洲 - Jù Kū Zhōu), which has complex terrain, cliffs, and ravines, with bamboo forests, ancient cities, shipwrecks, and ancient temples. When localizing the game, the first thing to do is to understand and master the knowledge related to “Wuxia” (武侠) and “Wuxia games”. Secondly, it is necessary to consider how to translate terms such as “Parry” (振刀 - Zhèn Dāo), “Special Souljade” (特殊魂玉 - Tè Shū Hún Yù), “Attribute Souljade” (属性魂玉 - Shǔ Xìng Hún Yù), and “Worship” (祭拜 - Jì Bài) in a way that conforms to the local customs of the players, using some easy-to-understand words to help players better understand the game.</p>
<p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has been localized into 14 languages worldwide. In addition to the popular markets such as Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, the Turkish market is also a new attempt. In the process of game localization in the Middle East market, more consideration should be given to the local customs and religious background. In the game, players have a task that needs to be completed through worship. However, most countries in the Middle East believe in Islam, so it is necessary to use words like worship more cautiously. Instead, the content of worship in the game is changed to “prayer” (祷告 - Dǎo Gào), which is more in line with the local cultural and religious background.</p>

<h2 id="4-Game-Localization-in-the-Turkish-Market"><a href="#4-Game-Localization-in-the-Turkish-Market" class="headerlink" title="4. Game Localization in the Turkish Market"></a>4. Game Localization in the Turkish Market</h2><p>As a place where Eastern and Western cultures meet, Turkey has a relatively high acceptance of mainstream games currently on the market. The mobile Internet has developed rapidly in the Middle East in recent years, especially Turkey, which is the largest mobile game market in the Middle East, accounting for nearly 40% of the market size of the entire Middle East. At the same time, Turkey is also the game market with the most demographic dividend in the Middle East. Its total population exceeds the total number of all individual European countries, and more than one-third of the population are gamers. According to statistics, Turkey’s gaming industry is moving towards an average annual revenue of $1 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2F48c39794-4d26-4163-b11a-6391d61f5998.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;48c39794-4d26-4163-b11a-6391d61f5998.png"></p>
<p>Currently, the revenue of the Turkish mobile game market is showing a continuous upward trend. Take November 2021 as an example. The total revenue of mobile games on both Google Play and App Store in Turkey was 2.5 times that of the same period in 2020, which is equivalent to the total revenue of Brazil and Chile. However, the revenue of Southeast Asia and Latin America, which are popular in the traditional mobile game market, is not as good as that of Turkey. The revenue growth in the past two years was only 50.5% and 27.6%, respectively, which is enough to show Turkey’s potential as an opportunity market.</p>
<p>However, a major difficulty in publishing games in Turkey is localization. The vast majority of Turkish players speak Turkish. However, Turkish is not as widely spoken as English. Currently, there are very few schools in China that offer Turkish language courses. Therefore, once you choose to enter the Turkish market, a major problem is a large and heavy localization problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2Fbc590ddc-b06f-47b8-8e54-8129a7b9a41b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;bc590ddc-b06f-47b8-8e54-8129a7b9a41b.png"></p>
<p>Speaking of the localization of Turkish games, the first thing to understand is the preferences of Turkish players and the historical background of Turkey. In terms of best-selling, FPS&#x2F;TPS and SLG are the main types of games that Turkish players pay for. At the same time, SLG is also the main source of payment in the entire Middle East market. Among the games that have gone overseas to Turkey, products from domestic manufacturers such as <em>PUBG MOBILE</em>, <em>Pasha Fencer</em>, <em>Game of Sultans</em>, <em>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</em>, and <em>Rise of Kingdoms: Lost Crusade</em> account for 30%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220701%2F33f0358b-44ce-4fc6-9b1a-8cfdbfc935e4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220701&#x2F;33f0358b-44ce-4fc6-9b1a-8cfdbfc935e4.png"></p>
<p>For the localization of the Turkish market, language is only the first step. In addition to text, what games need more is to break down cultural, religious, and humanistic barriers. For example, <em>Game of Sultans</em> and <em>The Great Ottoman</em>, although these two games are not mainstream in terms of themes, they are indeed refined products that deeply cultivate the Turkish market. The games’ restoration of the historical background and cultural details of the Ottoman Empire in Turkey has made them widely popular in the Turkish market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the premise of localization is not only basic language, but more importantly, to find the cultural “base”. In addition to pan-culture, for historical themes such as the Ottoman Empire, after receiving good feedback in Turkey, it can also be extended to surrounding areas with similar cultural groups, such as the Middle East. However, it should be noted that religious elements should still be considered when localizing Turkish products. The mainstream religion in Turkey is Islam. Although most Turks belong to the more moderate Sunni sect, it is still necessary to be more cautious about some taboos of Muslims, and avoid the appearance of pigs and other religious elements.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>It is impossible to localize a multilingual game without a localization team that has fully mastered it. It is very important to translate the expressions in localized games into the target language with the same enthusiasm and sincerity. Therefore, translating games requires constantly summarizing game terminology and learning new terminology knowledge, rather than relying solely on a comprehensive dictionary.</p>

    <title>Emotional Experiences Brought by NPC Interaction in RPG Games</title>
    <url>/2022/06/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20220704_28584_1028711/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220704/28584_1028711.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A survey in the book “How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design” pointed out that when asked “What moments in games make you want to cry?”, the vast majority of players answered that it was when facing the death of an NPC who fought alongside the player. As an object of emotional projection for players in the game, NPCs are one of the main sources of emotional experience for players in the game. The interaction between NPCs and players is particularly important in story-focused RPG games. So how do NPCs bring players a profound and three-dimensional emotional experience through interaction with players in RPG games?</p>
<h2 id="1-Credible-NPCs-Meeting-Player-Expectations"><a href="#1-Credible-NPCs-Meeting-Player-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="1. Credible NPCs - Meeting Player Expectations"></a>1. Credible NPCs - Meeting Player Expectations</h2><p>First of all, the appearance of NPCs in the game needs to meet the player’s expectations. If the behavior of the NPC and the interaction with the player are in line with the player’s expectations of the character’s inner and psychology, the NPC is credible. Such an NPC gives a lifelike feeling, even if the player knows that the facts are not so. Credibility must be consistent with the player’s expectations in order to create a high-quality, credible NPC. These expectations can be divided into three levels from the perspective of psychology: physics, biology, and psychology.</p>
<p>From a physics perspective, players expect animated and non-animated objects to follow what physicists call “naive physics”, which involves our everyday understanding of how the physical world works. For example, the movement of NPCs has a trajectory and does not appear out of thin air; NPCs are affected by factors such as weight and inertia, and will collide with each other rather than penetrate each other, and so on. These most basic rules that conform to the operation of objects in the physical world need to meet the original expectations of players. The magical creatures that resemble jellyfish in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em> line up in the air to form a path that helps players move forward; the NPC Robin in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, although walking around the library at will, will immediately turn around when the player touches her. These all conform to the basic rules of the physical world.</p>

<p>From a biological point of view, the real creatures that appear in the game world bring us a lot of “original” expectations. When players interact with other creatures, whether they are new creatures created in the game or portrayals of real creatures, our “original” expectations will evaluate these creatures. Psychologists call the results of these expectations “naive biology”. In the production of game NPC creatures, it should conform to people’s most basic expectations of the biological system. For example, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the interaction with pets, the feedback behaviors generated by players in the process of interacting with pets are based on the reactions of real creatures after being stroked and patted.</p>

<p>Psychological expectations are called “theory of mind”, which refers to the “naive theory” that everyone has to understand each other. However, it is very difficult to make all artificial characters in the game pass the Turing test. In order to meet the players’ naive expectations for artificial characters, game social interaction can respond accordingly. Starting from <em>GTA</em>, the game has a corresponding feedback design for NPCs to players. For example, when players enter a new scene, enter someone’s field of vision, or do something that attracts their attention, players can get corresponding feedback, such as the attention, greetings, complaints, and abuse of passers-by NPCs. In this way, the player’s game experience in this scene will be more vivid and interesting.</p>

<p>The NPC behavior in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is even richer. When a player walks into a room, the NPCs in the space will lock their eyes on the player, and even actively interact and talk with the player. The reactions of NPCs of different characters will also be different, such as the attention of guests, people standing waving to the player, greetings from the bar waiter, etc. These all realistically simulate the scene where people suddenly break into a space in life and attract the attention of passers-by, so the player’s emotional experience will be better.</p>

They have different personalities, introverted or extroverted, stubborn or open, stingy or friendly. Personalized and distinctive NPC shaping can bring players a vivid game experience and make the game world come alive.</p>
<p>Cassandra in the mobile game <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> will say in a slightly contemptuous and mocking tone: “You’re dressed just right for you—ordinary enough”, making players want to change into new clothes. Cassandra’s spicy and arrogant princess-like character makes people instantly think of the difficult classmates they would meet in school.</p>

<p>Or Xia Yan in the mobile game <em>Revelation</em>. Players will get Xia Yan’s help when they first enter the game. As an NPC, Xia Yan witnessed the player’s growth in the game. She always looks at you with a smile and tells you what the next step of the task is in the gentlest tone, like a caring older sister of the player in the world of Revelation. Players always think of good things happening when they see her, and there is a sense of intimacy. NPCs like this with unique personalities can bring players a more three-dimensional game experience, as if they are in a parallel world, and NPCs are the people we can also meet in this world.</p>

<h3 id="The-Depth-of-“Evil”"><a href="#The-Depth-of-“Evil”" class="headerlink" title="The Depth of “Evil”"></a>The Depth of “Evil”</h3><p>In RPG games that pay more attention to the story, the emotional interaction between villain NPCs and players is often more deeply rooted in people’s hearts. The “evil” of villains often stems from the tragic stories behind the NPCs, allowing players to understand their “evil” and create emotional connections with the NPCs. Arthas in <em>Warcraft</em>, the human prince with a superior background, pulled out the cursed sword under the lure of the dreadlord Mal’Ganis in order to defend his homeland. Under the impact of strong revenge, he gradually moved towards darkness and became a death knight who believed in darkness. Finally, he was killed under the attack of several coalition forces. Arthas is a tragic villain in ancient Greece and one of the most classic villain NPCs.</p>

<h3 id="Connection-with-the-Player’s-Subconscious"><a href="#Connection-with-the-Player’s-Subconscious" class="headerlink" title="Connection with the Player’s Subconscious"></a>Connection with the Player’s Subconscious</h3><p>What kind of characters do players want to punish in the game? The materialized monsters in the player’s subconscious, the most typical are the zombie NPCs in shooting games. They are villain NPCs that disrupt world peace and disrupt players’ task plans. In terms of appearance, they are monsters that look like humans, so in the player’s subconscious, killing zombies will have the same sense of accomplishment as “killing” real players, but at the same time, there is no guilt like “killing” real players. The Wujian Abyss mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is a typical case. In this mode, players become heroes who fall into the Wujian Abyss, and they “kill” the zombies in the chaotic abyss, bringing players a lot of pleasure.</p>

Fighting side-by-side with players is the most direct way to generate emotional experience with players. For example, Pu Songling in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em> serves as the player’s “guide” throughout the novice guidance process of the game, playing a great role in helping players quickly participate in the game and promoting the development of the story.</p>

Even if it does not directly interact with the player, the self-interaction of NPCs with the scene can create a more vivid game environment for the player, so that the player will not feel bored and lonely even in a single-player game. In <em>The Sims</em>, after the player chooses to interact with an NPC, the NPC will form its own actions according to the scene. For example, sit down on a nearby chair or lie down on the bed.</p>

NPC Behavior - Strengthening Emotional Experience</h2><h3 id="Protection"><a href="#Protection" class="headerlink" title="Protection"></a>Protection</h3><p>“Sense of responsibility” is an emotional experience that other traditional media cannot bring to the audience except for games. When the choice is given to the player, a sense of responsibility arises. Because the game background and game mechanics are easy to create a sense of heroism, the protective relationship is a relationship between the player’s avatar and the NPC that often appears in the game.</p>
<p>A very famous example is the game <em>ICO</em>, which uses a simple mechanism of holding the girl’s hand by pressing R1 to play the game. The girl can help the player cooperate to open doors and so on in some aspects. The girl is also very fragile, so much so that the player is very worried about losing her. Holding her hand means that the player is with the girl, and no matter what the situation, the player can protect the girl from harm. Through the extremely simple mechanism of “holding hands”, all the emotions and warmth in the game are created. This kind of emotion and healing do not need words and plot pictures to express. Through the interaction between the player and the NPC, the player forms a profound emotional experience.</p>

<h3 id="Cooperation"><a href="#Cooperation" class="headerlink" title="Cooperation"></a>Cooperation</h3><p>In recent years, games in which players and NPCs are dominated by cooperative relationships are also increasing. This cooperative interaction can usually be promoted through the game plot, thereby strengthening the player’s emotional experience. <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> tells the story of two brothers who embark on an adventure to save their seriously ill father. Both brothers are controlled by one player. They cross obstacles, meet allies, save people and save themselves along the way. The NPC giant in the game is very powerful and looks fierce, much like the big BOSS in the game. But the giant always wears a crying expression when he appears, because the giant has lost his wife and expects the protagonist brothers to help him rescue his wife. To this end, the giant and the two brothers reach a cooperation. The giant provides a lot of help to the player during the adventure, such as using his arms to build a bridge for the protagonist brothers, and the two brothers played by the player help the giant rescue his wife.</p>

<h3 id="Competition"><a href="#Competition" class="headerlink" title="Competition"></a>Competition</h3><p>As a special NPC in the game, the enemy and the competitive relationship formed by interacting with the player can also trigger the player’s emotional experience after being designed. In <em>A Chinese Ghost Story Online</em>, through the promotion of plot tasks, the game helps players deeply understand the events that happened in the village and the love story told in the game background, allowing players to accept challenges and defeat one NPC after another. In this process, players not only have a high sense of participation, but also cultivate a stronger role for themselves and obtain rich equipment, thus bringing players a high emotional experience.</p>

<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>The term NPC reveals that they mostly appear in narrative games. As the objects of players’ emotional projection, they are the key to narrative games to tell good stories and improve players’ emotional experience. For example, in RPG games, the relationship between NPCs and players is presented through dialogue or narration, and the word “relationship” is often the key word for emotional experience related to NPCs. Through the three perspectives of biology, physics, and psychology, credible and high-quality NPC characters that meet players’ expectations can be established; at the same time, shaping the complete personality and background of NPCs can allow NPCs to interact with players and scenes in the game and witness the growth process of players; finally, taking the behavior of NPCs as the outlet for players to strengthen their emotional experience, establishing relationships such as “protection”, “cooperation”, and “competition” in the process of tasks, creating diverse and profound emotional experiences for players in the game.</p>

    <title>Immortality or Change? The Dilemma and Breakthrough of French Localization</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220704/28584_1028724.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 30, 2022, the French government officially announced a major reform of the expression and use of video game terminology, stipulating the prohibition of English game terminology and requiring state public officials to take the lead in using pure French game terminology in their work to protect the purity of the French language.</p>
<p>The French Ministry of Culture stated that, given that the French e-sports field has been occupied by English, causing “understanding barriers” for non-gamers in France, banning English game terms will help facilitate the daily communication of the French people. In fact, French people or those who understand the development of French language and culture may already be indifferent, because the French official circles have taken many similar actions in the name of “French purity” in recent years, but the results have always been minimal. Behind such policies, it is not entirely the will of the French government, and the participation of the famous Académie française and the “Immortals” is indispensable.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Immortals-and-Generation-Z"><a href="#1-The-Immortals-and-Generation-Z" class="headerlink" title="1. The Immortals and Generation Z"></a>1. The Immortals and Generation Z</h2><p>Government intervention in the use of language is not an uncommon event: since the birth of French, France has used the power of the state and government to intervene in the use of standard language for hundreds of years. The Académie française is the oldest and most prestigious academic authority in France, composed of 40 academicians, who are appointed for life and are called “Immortals”. The main task of the Académie française is to standardize the French language and protect various arts. The “Immortals” work to maintain the clarity and purity of French in development and change. They not only compile dictionaries, but also achieve this goal by making suggestions and participating in various committees.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In 1975, France passed the “Act on Maintaining the Purity of French”, stipulating that the use of explicitly prohibited English words would be fined. In 1994, the “Law on the Use of French” was passed, prohibiting the use of foreign languages in public advertisements and radio and television programs (except for foreign language programs), and violators would be heavily fined. At the same time, the law also stipulates that all new French words must be explained and approved by the Académie française and published in the official gazette before they can be used.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the power of English has conquered cities and territories in countries around the world along with the development trend of the macro economy, and France, as a cultural power, has not been spared: in February 2022, the Académie française stated that French is undergoing “degeneration”. The reason is that the use of English words has become a habit among young people of Generation Z in France. This generation is deeply influenced by the Internet, instant messaging, mobile phones, computers and other technological products, and the community relations and values brought about by technological development have deeply affected their self-identity.</p>
<p>While American technology and entertainment companies are leading the global trend, they have also subtly introduced the core pronouns of their respective fields into the languages of different countries. This kind of invasion first made the French directly copy English, such as “hashtag”, “cloud computing”, “big data” and other words, which are already commonly used words in the daily expression of the French people. Then, the French were forced to graft flowers and trees, and speak English in a French way, such as “bugger &#x2F; buguer”, is the reader familiar? Add a French suffix to the English word “bug” and English becomes French. Finally, there is another type of English word, which belongs to “blossoming inside the wall and fragrant outside the wall”. For the “Customiser” used by many French network platforms, everyone must be familiar with it - a variant of the English word “Customize”, but in fact, many French people themselves may not be clear that this English word originated from the Old French word “Custume”.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Does-the-French-Government-Go-to-Great-Lengths"><a href="#2-Why-Does-the-French-Government-Go-to-Great-Lengths" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Does the French Government Go to Great Lengths?"></a>2. Why Does the French Government Go to Great Lengths?</h2><p>Behind all relevant news is a huge industrial chain - the cultural and creative industries have long become one of the important pillar industries of the French national economy, and the French government has played a vital role in the development of the digital publishing industry and the e-sports industry. Taking the direct income of the French cultural and creative industry in 2013 as an example, compared horizontally with other major production areas in France, the turnover of the cultural and creative industry has exceeded that of the automobile industry (60.4 billion euros) and the luxury goods industry (52.5 billion euros), approaching the communications industry (66.2 billion euros) and the chemical industry (68.7 billion euros). In other words, the cultural and creative industries play an important role in enhancing France’s international competitiveness and influence. The results of the “France Macroeconomic Imbalance Report” of the European Commission released in 2014 showed that video games have the most amazing high growth rate (72%) among all French cultural industries. From a consumption perspective, the cultural consumption habits of the French have undergone tremendous changes: the average daily time spent on the Internet, watching TV, listening to music, playing games, going to theaters, reading newspapers and other cultural and entertainment activities is about 9 hours.</p>
<p>In 2021, the total sales of the French video game market reached 5.6 billion euros, an increase of 1.6% compared with 2020. SELL, the French organization that provides the market annual report, that is, Le Syndicat des Éditeurs de Logiciels de Loisirs (created in 1995 and composed of giant companies specializing in publishing in the field of video games), pointed out that the number of French video games has increased by 13.5% in the past two years, and 2020 was also a record year for the French market.</p>
<p>In 2021, the combined sales of PC and console games were 24 million units, and the sales of accessories for these two platforms increased by 11%, reaching 480 million euros. During these years, the French market was still dominated by digital sales, and 82% of software sales were digital sales through PCs, consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>From the data in 2021, PC game sales showed an upward trend, increasing by 5% year-on-year, reaching 1.4 billion euros, while console and mobile games increased by 1% and decreased by 1% respectively, and the development momentum remained relatively stable. In 2021, the console accounted for 49% of the total French market, with sales of 2.7 billion euros, the highest level since 2008. In the same year, more than 2.37 million consoles were sold in the entire French market, and the potential of the French console game market cannot be ignored. Among them, whether it is the console game market or the PC game market, action games occupy a dominant position in the French market.</p>
<p>Today, the French video game market has moved from niche to mainstream. The French government promulgated the “Loi pour une République numérique” (Digital Republic Law) in 2016, officially recognizing the independent status of e-sports and its practitioners, and constantly planning relevant regulations to ensure the rapid and steady development of the French e-sports industry. After Paris successfully won the right to host the 2024 Olympic Games, the French Olympic Organizing Committee stated that it was considering including e-sports in the Olympic Games.</p>
<h2 id="3-French-Localization-from-AAA-Games"><a href="#3-French-Localization-from-AAA-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. French Localization from AAA Games"></a>3. French Localization from AAA Games</h2><p>It is better to say that the French government is mending the fence after the sheep are lost, than meddling in other’s affairs – a sense of crisis is driving the government, so it has to maintain its market in the form of decrees. The source of this crisis is English. In the trend of economic globalization, English is no longer an ordinary language, but a convention, a carrier, and a component of market value. French has been affected at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="Passive-and-Active"><a href="#Passive-and-Active" class="headerlink" title="Passive and Active"></a>Passive and Active</h3><p>In video games, the word “matching” frequently used in most multiplayer games does not have a perfect substitute in French, and can only be borrowed from English “Matchmaking” (as shown below) - not because of the lack of ability of localization staff, even the games under Ubisoft (a long-established French game company) use this method.</p>
<p>So, how to deal with proper nouns that have accurate French alternatives? As shown in the figure below, “FRIEND PASS” refers to a pass function. If one of your friends has purchased the game, the other party can invite you to play the game for an unlimited time. “FRIEND PASS” is literally translated as “friend pass”, and accurate alternative expressions can be found in French, but the Ubisoft localization team still uses a purely English expression. In fact, it is not difficult for us to speculate that in terms of this commercially related term, the localization team chose to tap the market value first. Here, as an important component of promoting market value, English has stronger universality than French, that is, this localization processing method can facilitate players’ understanding to the greatest extent, thereby promoting consumer behavior.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Ouroboros-Paradox"><a href="#Ouroboros-Paradox" class="headerlink" title="Ouroboros Paradox"></a>Ouroboros Paradox</h3><p>The French localization of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is also affected by the entanglement between English and French. For example, for the description of a hero’s skill in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>
<p>Chinese: “迦南的绝学” (Jia Nan’s ultimate skill)</p>
<p>English: “Matari’s unique ultimate”</p>
<p>French: “Ultime unique de Matari”</p>
<p>Without understanding French grammar and composition, it is easy for everyone to see that French actually achieves a “perfect” correspondence with English in form, but the word order is different. In fact, French players have feedback that “(French word unique) would make people think that Canaan has only one unique skill.” (The hero actually has three optional skills). That is, excessive reference to English text, or excessive procedural mechanical correspondence, ignoring the specific effect of French localization transplantation, will cause certain confusion to players.</p>
<p>So, where is the root of such problems? We still have to trace back to the language evolution of French and English. The English word unique comes from the French unique, and the French word comes from the Latin unicus. This situation is very common between the two languages. Now, a confusing thing has happened: for market and procedural considerations, French localization must refer to English content, but English is derived from French and other European languages at the source. Among them, small differences will inevitably have a huge impact. Therefore, French localization needs to be more cautious, starting from the player experience at all levels, obtaining real feedback from French players in a timely manner, and constantly testing the actual effect of localization.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>According to the French government, “streamer” should be changed to “joueur-animateur en direct”; “E-sports” should be changed to “jeu vidéo de compétition” - we don’t need to fully understand these languages to clearly see that this is advocating that the French people make their lives more “complicated”. The expansion of English influence and radiation in the world is not news, but its specific effect on the development trend of specific languages is worthy of our in-depth analysis. The changes brought about by this cultural interaction not only herald difficulties, but also symbolize breakthroughs - whether French can be rejuvenated and re-lead the direction of cultural output while actively and passively integrating with English is still worthy of our attention. Only by grasping the latest trends and changes can the results of localization attract players to the greatest extent and develop the potential of the local market.</p>
<p>Leihuo UX’s mission is to help Leihuo game products achieve commercial and reputational success through our work, and to promote the innovation of the game industry’s research and development process through our practices. For the global localization department, not only must the work of this department reach the industry-leading level, but also in-depth research on players and markets in related fields must be carried out. Only in this way can we make a greater contribution to the realization of the vision of Leihuo UX!</p>

    <title>Why the Love for &quot;Annual&quot; Games? — Starting with the *Call of Duty* Series</title>
    <url>/2022/07/03/netease-ux-articles/news_20220704_28584_1028726/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220704/28584_1028726.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, the new <em>Call of Duty</em> series released a new promotional video. The official name is <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II 2022</em>. Casually, it can also be called <em>Call of Duty 19</em>. Some players may find this official name very awkward or very familiar, which is fine, because the first <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> was released in 2009, and then in 2020, <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</em> was released. Now, a remaster is not enough, and Activision wants to completely reboot this series to reap the last wave of nostalgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2F01a56c96-0bce-40b3-af98-4f81d7fb725d.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;01a56c96-0bce-40b3-af98-4f81d7fb725d.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ghost, who died as early as 2009 and died again in the 2020 remaster, will be resurrected again in 2022</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So why is it that both publishers and players love annual games so much, and never get tired of it?</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Effect-of-Brand-Value"><a href="#1-The-Effect-of-Brand-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. The Effect of Brand Value"></a>1. The Effect of Brand Value</h2><p>When a publisher releases a hit, they will definitely try to keep the IP. This is also very common in other industries. For example, <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, which was released some time ago, was able to reboot <em>Jurassic World</em> 14 years after three <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies were made. Does it have the flavor of <em>Call of Duty</em> rebooting the <em>Modern Warfare</em> series? In fact, the reason is the same. When an excellent work appears, the publisher will try to continue its value, which is why many excellent games and movies have sequels.</p>
<p>However, the quality of the sequel is also very important. It stands to reason that a AAA title like <em>Call of Duty</em> requires hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and several years of development. If it is released every year, it is basically impossible to guarantee the quality of the game. So Activision Blizzard thought of this early on and handed over this possibly most valuable game IP to three different studios for development, so that each studio can get 2-3 years of development time, and each generation can bring players a different feeling.</p>
<p>For example, IW studio’s most classic Modern Warfare trilogy, and Treyarch’s Black Ops series, which has been foreshadowed since the fifth generation of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Finally, there is Sledgehammer Games, which was in danger. The 11th generation, Advanced Warfare, was their debut. Although it was controversial to put the theme on future warfare for the first time, the UI design of the gun information in it impressed the players. After all, two of the studio’s founders were from Visceral Games. It is obvious that there are shadows of the UI in <em>Dead Space</em>. These three top studios go hand in hand to ensure the quality of the game. The games that seem to be released every year have actually been polished for 2-3 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fe88e9f05-ab41-428b-8bec-16b65aec43a1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;e88e9f05-ab41-428b-8bec-16b65aec43a1.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The UI design of this generation left a deep impression</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Compared to <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s direct competitor <em>Battlefield</em>, only the support of the DICE studio makes it difficult for EA’s ace FPS to become an annual game. <em>Battlefield</em> can barely be released every 2-3 years. The shortcomings of non-annual releases are also obvious. <em>Battlefield 2042</em>‘s reputation has plummeted and cannot be remedied, and it is unknown when the next generation will be released. Although <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, which was released at the same time, is rarely mentioned after the next new game is released, and everyone’s attention is focused on the new <em>Call of Duty</em> 4 months later, even if the previous generation flops, Activision Blizzard can also say “Don’t panic, everyone, look at my new game next year, it will be better”, while EA can only remedy it through one DLC after another.</p>
<p>In summary, <em>Call of Duty</em> has become a high-value brand that allows players to form a fixed memory. Some people will buy it without thinking when they hear <em>Call of Duty</em>. This is because the brand value of <em>Call of Duty</em> is much higher than other games, and their brand value is largely due to the annual nature of the game. There are many releases, the quality is good, and the competitors really can’t keep up. How can you resist not buying it?</p>
<h2 id="2-Reduce-Game-Costs"><a href="#2-Reduce-Game-Costs" class="headerlink" title="2. Reduce Game Costs"></a>2. Reduce Game Costs</h2><p>The first is the cost of publicity and distribution. For example, when you think of FPS games, you think of <em>Call of Duty</em>, when you think of football games, you think of <em>FIFA</em>, and when you think of sports management games, you think of <em>Football Manager</em>. These are already inertial thinking. The marketing team no longer needs to spend a lot of money to let players know what our game is and what features our game has. Target players are already staring at the annual releases every year and are ready to buy. This kind of annual game that has formed a brand effect has a great advantage in publicity. Of course, there is another kind of brand effect, which is the producer effect. Hearing the names of Hidetaka Miyazaki and Hideo Kojima is actually a guarantee of quality in a sense, and publicity will also have a great advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fe223e7e7-fb4e-498f-a60e-e40dc955e8a8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;e223e7e7-fb4e-498f-a60e-e40dc955e8a8.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Football Manager》is a typical example of “old wine in new bottles”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another point is that the development cost of the game itself will be lower. For example, the <em>Football Manager</em> series is both loved and hated. The game mechanism is basically updated to 0 every year, but it needs to change the database of players every year. This database is the core content of the game. As a game industry practitioner, it is not difficult to imagine their development process: the basic game design process will not change, the basic gameplay and functions will be slightly optimized, and the data will be changed. It is very easy and pleasant. But this can’t be blamed too much on the manufacturers. If too many changes are made at once, it will be criticized by players. For example, <em>Call of Duty 15</em> directly cut out the single-player campaign, which caused many players to refuse to buy it (<em>Battlefield 2042</em> also cut out the single-player campaign, but it was not the direct reason for its poor reputation).</p>
<h2 id="3-Avoid-Development-Risks"><a href="#3-Avoid-Development-Risks" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Development Risks"></a>3. Avoid Development Risks</h2><p>Another benefit of annual games is that they can “make quick money” every year. For example, <em>Call of Duty</em> series every year is one of the most important sources of revenue for Activision Blizzard. If this series suddenly disappears one year, the development team may not be able to withstand the pressure from shareholders. Although Rockstar can spend 200 million in costs and 5 years of development time, they are also betting that <em>GTA5</em> will be a big seller in the future, and they have indeed sold more than 150 million copies.</p>
<p>But their parent company, Take-Two, is also very thoughtful. The <em>NBA 2K</em> series of its 2K studio still follows the annual series. After all, the development of <em>GTA6</em> also needs funds. The annual games allow the development team to avoid some unnecessary risks. After all, if this year’s sales are not good, new games can be released next year to continue selling. It will not cause several years of development investment to be wasted due to dismal sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2F55920a21-daaf-42a2-ac7e-30094cc5618c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;55920a21-daaf-42a2-ac7e-30094cc5618c.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Rockstar’s successful development experience is very, very difficult to replicate</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Following the previous point, Rockstar’s <em>GTA5</em> is a successful example, and <em>GTA6</em>, which has been released 9 years after the previous game, is likely to be a successful example. However, there are also many examples of infinitely increasing costs due to the long development cycle, such as the development of <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, which lasted for ten years. During this period, there were also situations such as temporary replacement of producers. The long-term development in the middle also almost “exhausted” the company.</p>
<p>The much-criticized <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also made for a long time. Finally, it couldn’t withstand the pressure to go online, cut a lot of game content, and pushed a semi-finished product full of bugs online. For example, the memorable black screen all the way out of Arasaka, I thought it was artistic processing at first, but later found that the processing time was a bit long, and finally realized that it was a bug. Faced with such a long-term R&amp;D, high-cost, and high-pressure new research project, if there is an annual game with a faster development rhythm, better sales expectations, and can also reduce game costs and risks, would you be tempted? Game companies need to make a profit. As for which of these two has greater risk and how to choose, it is naturally clear at a glance.</p>
<h2 id="4-Hidden-Worries-How-Long-Can-Annual-Games-Last"><a href="#4-Hidden-Worries-How-Long-Can-Annual-Games-Last" class="headerlink" title="4. Hidden Worries: How Long Can Annual Games Last?"></a>4. Hidden Worries: How Long Can Annual Games Last?</h2><p>Perhaps for manufacturers, steadily launching an annual game can continue to bring in a certain amount of revenue, but no one knows how long this rhythm will last, because the same game experience will not satisfy players. “Released every year, scolded every year, bought every year, played every year” has become the most pertinent evaluation of annual games by players. Blindly seeking stability will only make players feel tired. For example, the previously mentioned <em>Football Manager</em>, the gameplay system has hardly improved every year. The series is too conservative, causing the game to stagnate for several years. Even if there are no vicious bugs when the game is launched, the user experience of players has not improved.</p>
<p>Here we have to mention the competition between competitors. If you were to recommend a game to a classmate who likes the NBA and wants to try an NBA game, what would you recommend? After thinking about it, there seems to be no choice other than <em>NBA 2K</em>, and the overall quality of this game is also good, so it’s always right to recommend it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fb9989cc1-ffe2-4699-bdba-888589a03be8.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;b9989cc1-ffe2-4699-bdba-888589a03be8.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The mixed reviews say it all</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But for players familiar with the <em>NBA 2K</em> series, this game is definitely not perfect, and it is difficult to satisfy old players. The mixed Steam reviews also prove this point. Basically, each series of <em>NBA 2K</em> cannot achieve mostly positive reviews. However, if we don’t buy it, there will be no similar games to play this year, which also leads to the “love-hate” emotion of players.</p>
<p>Standing still is destined to not go far. The original absolute dominator of the NBA series, the <em>NBA Live</em> series, was taken away by the more realistic and better-looking <em>NBA 2K</em>. The lack of response from the former has since slumped and quickly disappeared from the players’ vision. The same is true for EA’s other ace FPS project, the <em>Medal of Honor</em> series. <em>Call of Duty</em> has made double breakthroughs in themes and techniques since the 4th generation, creating the <em>Modern Warfare</em> series. DICE studio, which started in 2002 and was subsequently acquired by EA, also leaped into modern times from <em>Battlefield 1942</em>; while <em>Medal of Honor</em> still insisted on the World War II theme setting and walked to the end. After being forced to turn to modern warfare themes in 2010, its poor game production details made the series instantly die, and no new works have been released since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220704%2Fbe848725-5182-4595-8375-e238b679b1ef.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220704&#x2F;be848725-5182-4595-8375-e238b679b1ef.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The familiar Normandy landing scene is gone forever</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, game manufacturers have also realized this problem. In order to ensure the quality of the game, manufacturers have begun to make trade-offs in the development model: Ubisoft announced that it would slow down the launch of new works after the launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em>; at the same time, Activision Blizzard also revealed in an internal email in April this year that although the sales of <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em> were good, it was confirmed that the <em>Call of Duty</em> series would no longer be an annual game, and the game’s development model will change from “annual release” to “always on”.</p>
<p>In short, the existence of annual games has caused a lot of controversy, but manufacturers and players are trying to adapt to the new environment.</p>

<p>Wuxia is a fairy tale for adults, Wuxia is the fantasy of the East, and Wuxia is a real world. Games based on Wuxia generally have rich storylines and continue to deliver the dream of wielding a sword and roaming the Jianghu with pleasure. In Vietnam, which is closely linked with China, there is still the romantic gene of Wuxia culture, and Wuxia-themed games are enduring. In the daily communication of ordinary Vietnamese people, there will also be metaphors like “as hypocritical and sinister as Yue Buqun.” It is undeniable that Vietnam has been deeply influenced by Wuxia culture.</p>
<p>This article hopes to analyze the Wuxia culture and Wuxia-themed games in Vietnam to answer the following two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the Vietnamese perception of Wuxia?</li>
<li>How is the development of Wuxia-themed games in Vietnam?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-The-“Wuxia-Craze”-that-Swept-Across-Generations"><a href="#1-The-“Wuxia-Craze”-that-Swept-Across-Generations" class="headerlink" title="1. The “Wuxia Craze” that Swept Across Generations"></a>1. The “Wuxia Craze” that Swept Across Generations</h2><p>Wuxia culture entered Vietnam in the early 20th century, when Vietnam was becoming a French colony, and the colonists tried to transform the original Vietnamese language into pinyin. By coincidence, the Vietnamese readers of Chinese classical Wuxia novels were no longer limited to Confucian scholars who had received Chinese education, but expanded to people of all classes who mastered the national language. After the Wuxia novel craze in Vietnam, Vietnamese writers began to become self-sufficient. In 1920, Nguyễn Chánh Sắt wrote <em>Hiệp Lữ</em>, which was also the first Wuxia novel in Vietnamese national language literature. <em>Hiệp Lữ</em> was warmly welcomed by readers as soon as it was published, and under the guidance of this work, a wave of Wuxia novel creation was set off.</p>
<p>After that, in just over 20 years from 1954 to 1975, a large number of works by Chinese Hong Kong and Taiwan Wuxia novel writers such as Jin Yong, Gu Long, Liang Yusheng, Wolong Sheng, and Zhuge Qingyun were translated into Vietnamese, which greatly influenced the artistic taste of several generations of Vietnamese people. It has been more than 100 years since Chinese Wuxia novels were spread to Vietnam, and now the footprints and influence of Wuxia culture in Vietnam are everywhere. Works with Wuxia as the theme are very popular in Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id="2-Vietnamese-People’s-Perception-of-“Wuxia”"><a href="#2-Vietnamese-People’s-Perception-of-“Wuxia”" class="headerlink" title="2. Vietnamese People’s Perception of “Wuxia”"></a>2. Vietnamese People’s Perception of “Wuxia”</h2><p>In Vietnamese, Wuxia is usually directly translated as Võ hiệp (武侠) or kiếm hiệp (剑侠). The definition of Wuxia in the Vietnamese dictionary is an ancient warrior who is good at swordsmanship and often does good deeds and helps the weak (Võ sĩ thời xưa, giỏi đánh kiếm, thường làm nghĩa, cứu giúp bênh vực kẻ yếu). This is almost similar to the domestic understanding of “Wuxia”.</p>
<p>The classic Wuxia story understood by Vietnamese people is like this: the male protagonist needs to experience tragedies such as the murder of his family, go through thousands of hardships and unbearable hardships, and learn various martial arts from many masters. In this process, he will quietly dormant, hide his name, and wait for various opportunities to prove himself in front of those who look down on him. At the end of the story, the male protagonist becomes an unmatched martial arts master, he constantly refines his skills and dominates the Jianghu. The eight common Wuxia characteristics are selflessness, justice, independence, loyalty, bravery, trustworthiness, not caring about money and reputation.</p>
<p>Vietnamese people can also be compatible with and understand the concepts of Wuxia works, such as martial arts, weapons (knives, swords, sticks, spears, abacus, fans, pens, pipes, or various musical instruments are all kinds of weapons familiar to Vietnamese people), Qinggong, internal strength, acupuncture, etc.</p>

The History of Wuxia-Themed Games Going Overseas to Vietnam"></a>3. The History of Wuxia-Themed Games Going Overseas to Vietnam</h2><p>Games with Wuxia as the background have always performed well in the Vietnamese video game market. From the earliest <em>JX Online</em> (Vietnamese version named “Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ”) and <em>Kiếm Thế</em>, to the endless stream of Wuxia-themed games such as <em>New Swordsman M</em> (一梦江湖), <em>Legend of Fire</em> (烈火), etc., the Wuxia background is not unfamiliar to Vietnamese players.</p>

<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> (JX Online) can be said to be the most influential game in the history of Vietnamese video games. <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> is a very classic MMORPG game with a sect system, task system, item enhancement&#x2F;refining system, life system and large-scale PVP siege warfare.</p>
<p>In April 2005, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> became the first online role-playing game with a Wuxia theme in Vietnam, “opening the door” for the later development of this series of games. The publisher of the game at that time was VinaGame (the predecessor of VNG). Immediately, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> became a popular online game. According to statistics, in just about half a year, the game had 4.7 million active accounts, accounting for about 85% of the game community at that time. It is worth mentioning that in 2005, Vietnam had only 19.7 million Internet users. At its peak, it occupied 80% of the Vietnamese game market. <em>JX Online</em> is also the earliest online game in the Vietnamese market that is charged by time.</p>

<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ is popular in Vietnam</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> takes the Southern Song Dynasty of China as the game background, allowing players to seem to feel the national hatred and family hatred at that time in the game. Although the game screen can no longer be compared with today’s Wuxia online games, it makes players more immersive. In addition, <em>Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ</em> achieved very high-quality offline player contact and community management in the early 2000s, and the folk also organized a lot of offline gatherings. From 2005 to 2006, Vinagame held offline Vo Lam Congresses to organize game players and established the first inter-server online game tournament in Vietnam, the First Bang Thien Ha tournament.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>When “New Swordsman M” (一梦江湖) was released in Vietnam, face pinching was loved by players.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From an observational point of view, there is no obvious difference between Vietnamese players and Chinese players in the preference of Wuxia-themed games. This also explains why many Chinese Wuxia games have achieved fruitful results when they go overseas to Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is the similarity of history or the spread of culture, Vietnamese players have a natural affinity for games with Wuxia as the background. They can understand the background and terminology in Wuxia, and their preferences for Wuxia are very similar to those of Chinese players. It can be said that Vietnam is another fertile land for Wuxia-themed culture. In the game world of galloping horses and swords, Vietnamese players are also pursuing their own Wuxia dreams.</p>

<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, when players are teleported into the battlefield, a loading page appears, with the difficulty of the current match displayed in the upper left corner, such as “evenly matched” in the image below. What kind of emotions will players have when they see this? Will they feel nervous when they see “quite challenging,” or will they relax when they see “easy to handle,” and bring this feeling into the match?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220705%2Fd5e5e1dd-cfa8-49c7-b309-8f185ef10dd1.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220705&#x2F;d5e5e1dd-cfa8-49c7-b309-8f185ef10dd1.png"></p>

<p>If this reaction occurs, it can be explained by the phenomenon of “priming.” The preconceptions we have after seeing the prediction of the difficulty of the match will strongly influence our interpretation and memory of this game. In the priming phenomenon, people’s prior judgments will strongly influence the way they perceive and interpret information. For example, seeing a “quite challenging” opponent, recalling the experience of being eliminated immediately after landing, and then avoiding high-resource areas where players gather, and choosing a route to farm.</p>
<p>The simple words on the loading page can make players perceive their positioning in this game. “Priming” is a concept in social psychology, which belongs to the category of social thinking. This article will explain the application of social thinking in game experience design.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-are-Social-Psychology-and-Social-Thinking"><a href="#1-What-are-Social-Psychology-and-Social-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="1. What are Social Psychology and Social Thinking?"></a>1. What are Social Psychology and Social Thinking?</h2><p>Social psychology studies how people view each other, how they influence each other, and how they relate to each other. Its core questions are: How do we construct the world? How do social intuitions guide or mislead us? How is social behavior affected by ourselves, others, and biological factors?</p>
<p>This discipline is divided into three directions: social thinking, social influence, and social relations. Among them, social influence analyzes the shaping of behavior by society and personality tendencies. Social relations mainly study biological behavior, individuals’ feelings and actions towards others. The social thinking that this article focuses on includes how to perceive oneself and others, beliefs and judgments, attitudes and behaviors, etc. The research topic is how we construct social reality and how social intuition affects us.</p>

Why Can Social Thinking Support Game Design?</h2><p>The Internet is increasingly reconstructing human “gaming” behavior and even daily interactions, such as WeChat steps and Ant Forest. In the game, especially in games with strong social attributes, the real space and the virtual space blend with each other. People communicate through the social systems built into the game platform or through communication tools and software. They not only contact each other in the game, but also participate in offline activities and rituals, making individuals, games, and society penetrate and embed each other through the integration of reality and the network.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s season updates, interactive concerts, and the latest addition of KAWS exhibitions and other cross-border activities are all attempts to integrate games with reality. All players can participate in the carnival, jump into the space-time rift together, watch rocket launches and robots fighting monsters, dance and play mini-games at concerts… <em>Fortnite</em> is good at grasping the emotions of players. These activities have strong social attributes. Although they cannot directly communicate like in reality, players will have a tacit understanding. Everyone’s identity seems to have changed in an instant. Everyone who fights on the battlefield will become gentle and friendly when participating in activities, as if they have become friends. The reason for this phenomenon is that in a specific environment, players’ cognitive identity of themselves and others has changed. Social thinking can help us understand the essence of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Many social subgroups, or “interest-based groups,” have formed around games. They are becoming increasingly organized, and then constructing a certain “subculture” with the ability to influence social life. More and more games are beginning to break the circle, holding offline exhibitions, and even, like <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>, building their own theme parks. The social form in the game and the real world are complementary. Therefore, the rational use of theories related to social thinking can guide our game design.</p>

How to Combine Social Thinking with Design</h2><h3 id="Self-and-Others"><a href="#Self-and-Others" class="headerlink" title="Self and Others"></a>Self and Others</h3><p>Social thinking can help us better understand ourselves and answer the ultimate question of “who am I.” The constituent elements of self-concept are called “self-schemas,” which is the understanding of oneself, such as strong, smart, etc., which strongly affects our processing of social information. The accurate positioning of oneself needs to be completed through “social comparison,” that is, comparing with others and thinking about why oneself is different.</p>
<p>In the game, we can help players understand their own positioning with the help of others’ situations and construct a reasonable self-schema. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has designed a leaderboard for each hero, accurate to the province and city. For achievement-oriented players, this is a very effective tool. By observing the leaderboard situation of each hero, they can establish game goals and plan their career in the game, such as using relatively easy heroes to rush to the top of the leaderboard, or thinking about how to maintain their ranking on the leaderboard. Perhaps, players will imagine what level they will reach and what position they will get on the leaderboard. This is the concept of “possible selves.”</p>

<h3 id="Beliefs-and-Judgments"><a href="#Beliefs-and-Judgments" class="headerlink" title="Beliefs and Judgments"></a>Beliefs and Judgments</h3><p>The priming effect at the beginning of the article is one of the ways we perceive the social world. There are some more interesting research conclusions about the priming effect. Our processing of many pieces of information is automatic and subconscious. Due to the existence of embodied cognition (there is a strong connection between physiological experience and psychological state), even physical feelings will initiate our social judgments. Therefore, changing to a set of peripherals that you like can theoretically improve the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Our perception of the world comes from experience and memory, as does the game world. The game will tell a complete story. Even if the game has already done foreshadowing, players will sometimes still be dissatisfied with the plot content, thinking that it is not self-consistent. They will point out problems or describe the story they think is reasonable for everyone to discuss. This phenomenon is called “belief perseverance.” People are attached to the beliefs they held before (the ideological consciousness formed by the fusion of real life and the game worldview, which is expressed here as the view on the plot), and it is difficult to change their views when they are denied.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the player’s gaming experience, multi-ending games, or adding selectable plot directions in the game, are common solutions that can satisfy players’ different views. <em>Deathloop</em> constructs a peculiar world. When players first wake up on the beach, they will continue to receive a lot of novel settings. With the progress of the game, each player will form a unique belief about this virtual world in their minds. In the final choice, no matter whether the player shoots or commits suicide, their judgment can get the most consistent ending with expectations. Judgment and belief are closely connected. Decisions and explanations based on impressions are called “heuristic judgments,” and the choices made in the game are like this.</p>

<h3 id="Attitudes-and-Behaviors"><a href="#Attitudes-and-Behaviors" class="headerlink" title="Attitudes and Behaviors"></a>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3><p>People’s attitudes and behaviors often differ. The final answer reached by social psychologists is: our attitudes and behaviors are each affected by many factors, but under certain conditions, our thoughts and feelings will be closely related to our actions. In the theory of planned behavior, a better indicator of predicting individual behavior is to understand the individual’s behavioral intentions and their perceived self-efficacy and sense of control.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Death Stranding</em> as an example, players will understand the worldview in the plot and clarify that they need to connect the node city and the relay station with the chiral network to save the world. This part can establish the player’s attitude towards behavior. The online buildings in the scene and the delivery information of other players in the menu can help players establish a self-schema, so as to have their own subjective standards. Various guidelines and encouragements in the game have strengthened players’ beliefs that they can achieve their goals, which belongs to the perceived control. The above attitudes, subjective standards, and sense of control are collectively expressed as the player’s behavioral intention to continue the game, arrange the itinerary, and set off immediately. This is the embodiment of attitude predicting behavior.</p>
<p>How to make players have the attitude expected by game designers depends on various systems and designs in the game. For example, through plot cutscenes, emails, and well-placed background music embedding, to tell the worldview. Leaderboards, map systems that emphasize online buildings, signs in scenes, order systems, evaluations, and achievement systems can all directly or subconsciously cultivate players’ attitudes.</p>

<p><em>In 《Death Stranding》, the relationship between game design, player attitude, and player behavior</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Conversely, behavior may also affect attitudes. The behavior prescribed by social roles casts the attitude of the role-player. In the game, will there often be NPCs asking you for help, and these requests are one after another, becoming more and more complicated? Experiments have shown that if you want someone to do you a big favor, an effective strategy is to ask them to do a small favor first. This is the “foot-in-the-door phenomenon,” which is widely used in the design of game mission systems.</p>
<p>Also in <em>Death Stranding</em>, in the game, when you complete a commission, the NPC will thank you and give you more and more complex orders (tasks). The journey of delivering packages is becoming more and more dangerous. The main, side, or simply helping other players that players need to accept will become more and more difficult. The game also designs a corresponding system to assist players and balance the difficulty curve. For example, in the order system, the route, requirements, and possible dangers on the road are displayed in detail; if you encounter difficulties, you can also seek material assistance from other players through Bridges Link. The foot-in-the-door phenomenon coupled with proper difficulty control can keep players in a state of flow.</p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Social thinking mainly explains scientific research related to social cognition, involving a wide range. This is a subject about “people,” and game design is also player-oriented. A virtual society that interacts with reality has also appeared in the game world. Social thinking can analyze the self-thinking of players in the game, reveal the social forces behind their behavior, and also provide theoretical support for the design of various systems. Exposure to knowledge from other disciplines is very beneficial to design. “Once the mind is expanded, the thought will never return to its original narrow field.”</p>

    <title>The Paradox of &#39;Large&#39; and &#39;Small&#39;: Factors Influencing Players&#39; Perception of In-Game Map Size</title>
    <url>/2022/07/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20220718_28584_1031429/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220718/28584_1031429.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When analyzing game sentiment, we often find that there may be significant contradictory perceptions among players regarding the size of the in-game map: when experiencing the same map, some players will report that the map is too large, while others will report that it is too small. Why does this contradiction occur?</p>
<p>By analyzing various factors that affect players’ perception of map size, this article will help you understand the source of this contradictory perception and, as a game designer, how to find a balance in this contradiction.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Large"><a href="#1-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Large" class="headerlink" title="1. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Large?"></a>1. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Large?</h2><p>“This game map is so big, every time I want to go to a target point, I need to run for a long time.”</p>
<p>“The map is too big, and I feel like I need to walk a long way to find relevant resources.”</p>
<p>“The map is a bit big, and I feel like I’ve been running and circling. What’s worse, I feel like I’m running very slowly, and I feel like the limited experience time is spent running.”</p>
<p>The above player feedback comes from a survival game we recently surveyed. Obviously, many players have reached a consistent conclusion on the issue of map size - the in-game map is too large, which affects their gaming experience to a certain extent. However, if we delve into the player feedback, we can find that the reasons why players feel that the game map is too large are significantly different. For example:</p>
<p>“This game map is so big, every time I want to go to a target point, I need to run for a long time.”</p>
<p>This is one of the important factors that affect players’ perception of map size: <strong>the arrangement of target coordinates within the map.</strong> For example, when we play battle royale games, we are accustomed to studying the coordinates of each target in the game map before choosing an airdrop point, and at the same time evaluating the possible resources around each location. If, in two maps of the same size, one map has a longer distance between targets, then the players will spend more time running and finding landmark targets, which will make them feel that the map is too large, “I feel like I can’t reach the target point no matter how I run.”</p>
<p>This perception of the game map being too large due to the long travel time is particularly obvious in games with significant time limits. For example, in battle royale games, players need to run out of the shrinking circle within the specified time. If the shrinking speed is too fast and the target point is too far away, players will naturally feel that “the map is so big, I can’t run to it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F26c74617-233f-4a21-95e3-6589fc808920.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;26c74617-233f-4a21-95e3-6589fc808920.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Figure 2: The “Wilderness Paradise” map of <em>Knives Out</em>, through the yellow building indicator, players can roughly see the arrangement of buildings around each landmark block)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the distribution of the coordinates themselves in the map, the distribution of corresponding effective resources will also greatly affect the player’s perception of map size. For example, in survival games that require collecting resources, making props, and then improving survival and combat capabilities, if the resource point distribution is too scattered, it will also make players feel tired of running around in the game, just like the player feedback mentioned above:</p>
<p>“The map is too big, and I feel like I need to walk a long way to find relevant resources.”</p>
<p>Maybe the map itself is not large, but in the life-and-death atmosphere created by the game, the resource distribution is too scattered and difficult to find, which will also make players transfer the experience difficulties they encounter to the map size design itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fef9570ce-39bd-4213-8157-729f9493f5eb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;ef9570ce-39bd-4213-8157-729f9493f5eb.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Figure 3: A map of the S3 Ash Plain treasure chest distribution created by <em>LifeAfter</em> players)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, in addition to the distribution of target locations and resource points, the <strong>movement speed</strong> design of in-game characters also greatly affects players’ perception of the game map size, especially in some games without significant map instructions, where players need to constantly experience and finally “measure the map size with their feet.” The difference in spatial size perception caused by this movement speed design problem is also particularly obvious. For example, in the following player feedback, compared to the game map size itself, movement speed may be an important factor affecting their gaming experience:</p>
<p>“The map is a bit big, and I feel like I’ve been running and circling. What’s worse, I feel like I’m running very slowly, and I feel like the limited experience time is spent running.”</p>
<p>In order to reduce the impact of in-game movement speed on players’ perception of spatial size to a certain extent, many games have added many mechanisms to increase movement speed in the running design, such as in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which innovatively designed a grappling hook mechanism, which can help players quickly smooth out the disadvantages caused by geographical location and increase the excitement of in-game melee combat and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F48809a4f-b55c-45ac-89a1-71db76239a52.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;48809a4f-b55c-45ac-89a1-71db76239a52.png"></p>

<h2 id="2-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Small"><a href="#2-What-Factors-Make-Players-Feel-That-the-In-Game-Map-is-Too-Small" class="headerlink" title="2. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Small?"></a>2. What Factors Make Players Feel That the In-Game Map is Too Small?</h2><p>The above are some of the factors that we have compiled in our daily work that will lead players to believe that the game map is too large. So, what factors might make players feel that the in-game map is too small? We believe there may be the following situations:</p>
<p>First, it may be that <strong>the sense of spatial closure caused by too many obstacles</strong> makes players think that the in-game map is too small. For example, in a study on the experience of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> players, we found that a considerable number of players who have experienced other FPS games will think that some scenes in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> are too small, for example:</p>
<p>“The real combat area is too small, and it feels often crowded.”</p>
<p>“The indoor structure space is small, and it is not easy to carry out offensive and defensive cooperation.”</p>
<p>If you carefully study the player’s feedback, you can find that the problem that players complain about is not that the overall combat map is too small, but that the combat area in the scene is small and the combat distance is too close, which may make players face frontal attacks. , The space for maneuvering and retreating is limited. One prominent design of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is that there are many scene elements (such as obstacles) that affect combat, which may cause some players who are accustomed to long-range combat in open spaces to get stuck at the initial stage of the experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F7ace1dc0-2b22-4143-954e-cf3e3db3d411.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;7ace1dc0-2b22-4143-954e-cf3e3db3d411.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(Figure 5: Combat scene of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, <strong>the limited number of explorable target points and resource points in the map and their concentrated distribution, or the fast movement speed in the game</strong>, may also make some players who have the desire to explore the map think that the in-game map is too small and lacks challenge.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Seek-Balance-in-the-Face-of-the-Perceptual-Paradox-of-“Too-Big”-and-“Too-Small”"><a href="#3-How-to-Seek-Balance-in-the-Face-of-the-Perceptual-Paradox-of-“Too-Big”-and-“Too-Small”" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Seek Balance in the Face of the Perceptual Paradox of “Too Big” and “Too Small”"></a>3. How to Seek Balance in the Face of the Perceptual Paradox of “Too Big” and “Too Small”</h2><p>Whether it is a game designer or a user researcher, when we encounter contradictory sensory feedback such as the in-game map being too large, too small, and other similar sensory contradictions, how should we seek balance? Before implementing real design modifications and optimizations, we can think as follows:</p>
<p>First, what kind of player made a specific perception of space size?</p>
<p>From the above analysis, we can see that the player’s own game experience and preferences may have a significant impact on their spatial perception ability. For example, for players with strong exploration desires, they will prefer a map size design that is vast and can stimulate the desire to run and explore.</p>
<p>Secondly, do players have other deeper game needs besides feedback that the map is too big or too small? Compared with the feedback that the map itself is too big or too small, what we need to do more is to dig deep into the players’ deep-seated game motivations and needs, and optimize the game mechanism for these deep-seated needs. For example, reducing running time and using the limited time for exciting frontal battles and strategic play; or wanting to collect resource materials as soon as possible to achieve more game achievements.</p>

    <title>Gamification in Communities: Community Badges</title>
    <url>/2022/07/13/netease-ux-articles/news_20220718_28584_1031430/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220718/28584_1031430.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-Application-of-Gamification-in-Communities"><a href="#1-Application-of-Gamification-in-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1. Application of Gamification in Communities"></a>1. Application of Gamification in Communities</h2><p>Since the 1980s, scholars in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have continuously tried to use games to inspire exploration in non-game scenarios such as education and sociology. In research, the concept of gamification mostly focuses on the inspiration brought by game design, gameplay, and user experience. Gamification itself is an informal and inclusive explanation, usually referring to the application of game elements in non-game scenarios to improve user experience and engagement.</p>
<p>In online communities and social media, gamification design has also seen increasing applications: from the evaluation system of shopping websites, to restaurant and takeout reviews, to the achievement system of Q&amp;A websites, and so on. The common feature of these websites and communities is that they rely on user output to develop and maintain the community. Therefore, how to encourage users to participate in the community has become one of the main goals of these communities.</p>
<p>Preece &amp; Schneiderman, in “The Reader-to-Leader Framework”, divided community users into five levels according to their degree of participation: all users, readers, contributors, collaborators, and leaders. Two of the major factors affecting community members’ willingness to contribute are: the visibility of members’ contributions and the recognition of members’ high-quality contributions and expertise.</p>
<p>Just as outstanding students in school can get red stars, and students with excellent grades can occupy the top of the leaderboard, achievements and badges in games are also a recognition and reward for players’ achievements. Similarly, by using gamification methods to design some virtual rewards to stimulate community members, more people can actively participate in community building, and at the same time, it can better highlight active community members and create a good community atmosphere. As a common virtual reward in communities, the design of community badges can also be considered from multiple perspectives such as the value, meaning, and distribution management methods of the badge itself.</p>
<h2 id="2-Badge-Design-in-Communities"><a href="#2-Badge-Design-in-Communities" class="headerlink" title="2. Badge Design in Communities"></a>2. Badge Design in Communities</h2><p>In the community, as one of the incentives for members to participate in the community, the design of badges is also varied. The famous online forum Discuz! once released the badge function in its Discuz! X2.5.</p>
<p><em>Various Discuz! badges used in a singer’s official forum</em></p>
<p>In overseas community forums, the developer community Stack Overflow has designed different achievement badges for different user scenarios and preferences in order to encourage users to participate in community activities. In order to encourage users to answer questions, Stack Overflow provides a variety of badges for different user levels, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guru badge:</strong> Guru means mentor in religion, and in Stack Overflow, this badge means that the member’s answer is accepted by the questioner and gets more than 40 points (in Stack Overflow, each time a member’s answer is liked, it gets 1 point, and each time it is disliked, it gets -1 point);</li>
<li><strong>Self-Learner badge:</strong> Refers to the member who answered his own question, and the answer received more than 3 points;</li>
<li><strong>Tenacious badge:</strong> Represents that the member has more than 5 answers with 0 points, and the 0-point answers account for more than 20% of their total answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These various badge designs cover the user scenarios of different levels, and purposefully render the atmosphere of the community encouraging users to create together - no matter what kind of questions are answered, no matter how many likes are received, it is a behavior worthy of encouragement in the community. Similar to the Tenacious badge, there are also many achievement titles in games, such as the Lucky Star and Koi achievements in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which claim to be mixed into the front row.</p>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Koi Achievement</em></p>
<h3 id="Facebook-Group-Badges"><a href="#Facebook-Group-Badges" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Group Badges"></a>Facebook Group Badges</h3><p>In 2017, the global social media platform Facebook launched the badge function in its group section “Facebook Group”, and in 2018 began to promote it to eligible communities (with more than 50 members). Administrators of eligible communities can manage the display configuration of badges related to the community in the Facebook Group backend panel. The Facebook Community officially explained that this function was established to “clarify the identity of administrators, reward community members who have made outstanding contributions, and enhance mutual understanding among members.”</p>
<p><em>Facebook Group backend management page related to badges: Administrators can only enable or disable a specific badge, and the distribution and rules of badges are completed by the Facebook platform and backend algorithms</em></p>
<p>In the game community research, Lei Huo UX’s user researchers evaluated the comprehensibility, information content, and distinguishability of the 6 common Facebook Group badges at that time. The research results show that Facebook Group badges play a role in emphasizing member roles and increasing member exposure, but specific badges may also cause readers and administrators to have certain biases when browsing the content of the post while prompting the identity of the post author. Since the badge distribution rules are not clear, core members of the community will have different understandings of the meaning of specific badges based on their own experience. In the eyes of users, what is more important than badges is the “poster itself” and the “content of the post”.</p>
<p><em>The 6 types of Facebook Group badges included in the study</em></p>
<p>By introducing a system similar to badge achievements in the community through gamification, for users who read posts, badges that prompt the author’s authority or the length of time the user has participated in the community (such as Admin, Moderator, New Member, Founding Member) will have a certain impact on their understanding of the content. Members believe that the speeches of administrators and old members are “more authoritative”, the content of the posts is “more trustworthy”, and will also attract more attention and discussion. Administrators themselves also said that under the extra exposure brought by the badges, they will pay more attention to restraining their behavior to create a good community atmosphere. Conversely, for the content published by new members, members will “lower their expectations” and “understand them patiently and empathetically.”</p>
<p>For other badges related to the frequency and content of posts, there will not be much difference in content understanding from ordinary posts. The high exposure brought by badges will relatively amplify some shortcomings and mistakes in the content. From the perspective of administrators, these posts will also be “more eye-catching”. For example, the “Conversation Starter” badge in the Facebook Group, the designer’s original intention was to commend members who put forward “meaningful discussions” in the community, but the statistical method of this badge only considered the number of replies to the original post, and the content quality of the original post was not included in the consideration of this badge, which led to some of the members who were awarded the Conversation Starter badge after the function was released being members who often provoked conflicts in the community. Users actually feel that such badges are “unrealistic”, and administrators believe that such badges will cause their “extra attention” when they appear after a period of adaptation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Top Fan badge belongs to the Facebook Page and was not originally included in this research plan, but many users still mentioned this badge during the interview.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Brought-by-Badge-Design-to-Game-Communities"><a href="#3-Opportunities-and-Challenges-Brought-by-Badge-Design-to-Game-Communities" class="headerlink" title="3. Opportunities and Challenges Brought by Badge Design to Game Communities"></a>3. Opportunities and Challenges Brought by Badge Design to Game Communities</h2><p>By introducing achievement and badge systems in the community through the concept of gamification, it can encourage community members to participate in interaction to a certain extent and enhance community stickiness. However, there are many differences in the social purposes of players in the game and in the community, and community badges cannot simply copy the achievement system in the game. Easeley &amp; Ghosh (2016) proposed. In the community, if you want to design a competitive ranking badge similar to “highest contribution”, using absolute values (such as the top 10) in the badge acquisition conditions is more helpful for community members to understand the value of the badge than using relative percentages (the top 1%).</p>
<p>As designers, when designing badges for game communities, they should also consider the transparency of the rules, the interpretability, sustainability, and flexibility of badges in different communities. In the design process of community badges, for the choice of badge name and the specific description of the badge, designers should find a balance between improving interpretability and simplicity, and should also consider the actual situation of the community, allowing users to participate in the customization process of badges, so that the badge achievement system can be better used by the community and create and maintain a good community atmosphere.</p>

    <title>The Magic Touch to Enhance Combat Thrill: In the World of Martial Arts, Only Slowness is Unbreakable!</title>

<p>When describing a game’s combat system, we often hear words like “satisfying,” “exciting,” and “explosive.” We also often hear comments about the game’s fast-paced combat and tight level design. So, does the thrill of a combat game rely solely on speed?</p>
<p><em>Sifu</em>, as a fighting game, has received a lot of praise since its launch. Similar to many kung fu movies, the protagonist often faces a room full of enemies, being ganged up on. The dodging, blocking, posture system, and complex combo mechanics of upper and lower attacks require players to constantly observe the enemy’s movements and react quickly and correctly. The overall fighting rhythm of the game is very fast, making your fingers sore from button mashing, but there is a very important “Focus” skill system. When used, it slows down the movements of all surrounding enemies, allowing the protagonist to unleash a powerful blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F4f56927e-11db-4a5d-8718-76f0b08ac2f4.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;4f56927e-11db-4a5d-8718-76f0b08ac2f4.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Using the Focus skill “Powerful Sweep Kick”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sudden slowing down of the camera during combat does not give players a sluggish experience. On the contrary, it can increase the richness of the game mechanics and enhance the feeling of impact. Looking back at other games I’ve played before, this slow-motion mechanism is actually very common. Although they are all slow-motion, the experience they bring to players varies due to different trigger mechanisms and trigger scenes.</p>

Ranged Attacks - Assisting Aim, Enhancing Expressiveness</h2><p>In 1999, the movie <em>The Matrix</em> made the “bullet time” filming technique famous. The instantaneous trajectory of the bullet was clearly presented to the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F1f816a50-1246-4e5f-a17c-6c35b41fdd8a.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;1f816a50-1246-4e5f-a17c-6c35b41fdd8a.gif"></p>

<p><em>The famous bullet time scene in “The Matrix”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The airflow, smoke, flying cape, and 360-degree rotating camera position all made this bullet-dodging scene achieve the ultimate expressiveness. This slow-motion presentation method was later not only used in many gunfight movies, but also in many combat games that use ranged weapons.</p>
<p>In <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, when the player draws the bow, triggering Focus or jumping will enter a slow-motion state. All scene dynamics and the player’s actions will be slowed down. In addition to helping players better aim at the opponent, the effect triggered by the arrow hitting is also more visually impactful.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the rhythm of the lens is not a single slow. The process of releasing the arrow is still rapid, while the explosion is slow. In the slow-motion perspective, a huge mecha creature rushes towards you, and the rocket ignites the fuel tank on its back. Steel and fire blend together in an instant, and the burning picture is frozen. The slow-fast-slow processing method expresses the “sense of impact” to the fullest.</p>

<p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, using the “Dead Eye” skill can enter the auxiliary aiming state. In this state, not only will the character’s actions slow down, but after the Dead Eye skill is upgraded, it can also mark multiple enemies during this slow-motion period to complete a burst of bullets, and view the enemy’s weak points (such as the head, heart, lungs, etc.) to achieve the purpose of one-hit kill.</p>

Melee Combat - Time Window, Special Skills, Powerful Counterattacks"></a>2. Melee Combat - Time Window, Special Skills, Powerful Counterattacks</h2><p>The mechanism of using slow motion in melee games is different from that of ranged attacks. Melee combat does not have the problem of aiming, but it is usually fast-paced and has a low fault tolerance rate. Therefore, many games use slow motion to provide players with a certain reaction time window.</p>
<p><em>Katana ZERO</em> is a pixel-style fighting game. The enemies move fast, and some even have bullets. The player has no health bar, only a katana in their hand. Therefore, they either kill the enemy with one slash or are instantly killed by the enemy. In addition to direct fast attacks, players can actively trigger “bullet time,” and the picture will enter slow motion. During this process, they can deflect bullets or take the opportunity to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F6f5e79e6-8bcb-45b6-99a4-c9758b0305d8.gif/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220718&#x2F;6f5e79e6-8bcb-45b6-99a4-c9758b0305d8.gif"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bullet Time in《Katana ZERO》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In “bullet time” mode, the screen turns black, and only the protagonist and the target are lit up, as well as the attack animation. This mechanism lowers the operating threshold for players who are not pursuing extreme speedruns. However, due to the visual impact of the before-and-after comparison, the undiminished speed of the attack effects, and the slow-motion blood splatter, the thrill of the game is not weakened.</p>
<p>Other games use slow motion as a transition between the player’s parry&#x2F;dodge and a powerful counterattack, as a foreshadowing of the powerful counterattack, making the thrill of the counterattack stronger.</p>
<p>The perfect parry in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and Link Time in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> are such examples. After the player parries the enemy’s attack at a specific moment or successfully dodges the enemy’s attack, they will enter a short slow-motion phase. At this time, the player can launch a powerful counterattack against the enemy. Since this kind of bullet time is not completely actively triggered by the player at any time, it requires players to be familiar with the attack animations of different enemies in order to master the appropriate button timing. Also, because it is difficult to master and has high returns, the sense of accomplishment brought by triggering a perfect parry&#x2F;perfect dodge is even stronger.</p>

Supporting Visual Performance - Focusing on Key Points, Enhancing Feedback</h2><p>Slow motion changes more than just the rhythm of the camera. Looking at the games mentioned above, when slow motion is triggered, players often have a clear goal. Therefore, in order to highlight this goal and enhance the player’s combat thrill, games usually make some other screen processing.</p>

Common methods include changing the screen color&#x2F;radially blurring the surrounding picture&#x2F;enlarging the subject, etc.</p>
<p>Unifying the picture into a monochromatic tone and highlighting the current target subject with the original color or other emphasizing colors is a very useful method. <em>Katana ZERO</em> and <em>Sifu</em>, mentioned above, are such examples. Unimportant scenes are greatly weakened during the slow-motion process, and the attack effects and both the enemy and the player stand out in such scenes.</p>

<p>Other games radially blur the surrounding picture, making the blurred lines converge towards the center of the picture, which is the target subject, making the picture seem to have speed lines in comics. And the direction lines of this blur also serve as a visual guide for players, making the clear target subject in the center more eye-catching.</p>

<p>After the irrelevant information in the picture is weakened, if some UIs of specific skills are added at this time, they will also become more eye-catching. Just like the Focus skill option wheel attached to the enemy silhouette in <em>Sifu</em> and the counterattack prompt key in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, the enhanced UI will not make players feel abrupt. Instead, it can allow players to notice the most important information in a short time and focus their attention.</p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the out-of-game grappling hook display system also uses bullet time. The camera stretches towards the direction of the grappling hook launch, focusing the subject of the picture on the grappling hook. Slow motion is used during the launch process, and the original speed is restored when the grappling hook is deployed. Between the contrast of fast and slow, the grappling hook, as an important functional appearance, is shown in great detail.</p>

Therefore, the attack performance after the end of slow motion is often more prominent than ordinary attacks. For example, the powerful counterattacks mentioned earlier.</p>

As a gameplay mechanism, slow motion can assist players in aiming and highlight more important information in ranged attacks, while in melee combat, it can provide players with reaction time and provide block feedback. And its own visual expressiveness is added with the unique artistry of the game. Fast and slow, strong and weak, color and black and white, the contrast between before and after complements each other.</p>

    <title>Going Against the Grain: Why Do Souls-like Games Torture Players Yet Become a Global Phenomenon?</title>
    <url>/2022/07/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20220718_28584_1031441/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220718/28584_1031441.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Souls-like” games, a unique genre created by game producer Hidetaka Miyazaki, are almost synonymous with “torture”. Unlike most games, Souls-like games have a very high learning curve, requiring players to fight in a world full of dangers and survive countless difficult boss battles. Even a little carelessness can cause the player to die at the hands of a roadside mob. This “torturous” experience has fascinated a large number of players, who curse at repeated deaths while being inseparably pursuing the hard-won victory.</p>
<p>In April 2021, at the Golden Joysticks, the oldest video game award ceremony, the public voted <em>Dark Souls</em> as the greatest game of all time. And the latest Souls-like game, <em>Elden Ring</em>, sold 12 million copies worldwide in half a month, becoming another ten-million-selling IP under FromSoftware.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fee32c3aa-74f3-45d8-aaf3-4b9b1a2365c8.jpg/size/" alt="Elden Ring"></p>
<p>With many games opting to lower the learning curve to attract users, how can Souls-like games be so difficult and hardcore, yet achieve such excellent sales? One of the big reasons is that Souls-like games have a unique temperament that can give players a distinctive emotional experience, which makes them stand out among many trendy games. This article discusses how Souls-like games capture the hearts of players from the perspective of emotional experience.</p>
<h2 id="1-Unique-“Dark”-Emotional-Experience"><a href="#1-Unique-“Dark”-Emotional-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. Unique “Dark” Emotional Experience"></a>1. Unique “Dark” Emotional Experience</h2><p>Today’s game genres are basically divided based on the core gameplay of the game, which has created a situation where conventional games may have innovations in gameplay, but their emotional experience tends to be homogenized. The reason why Souls-like games are so successful is that they create a very strong dark, apocalyptic atmosphere, thus avoiding the homogenization of game emotions and emotional experiences, and making them stand out among many competitors.</p>
<h3 id="Core-Experience-of-Difficulty-and-Exploration"><a href="#Core-Experience-of-Difficulty-and-Exploration" class="headerlink" title="Core Experience of Difficulty and Exploration"></a>Core Experience of Difficulty and Exploration</h3><p>The special death mechanism, dark artistic expression, obscure narrative techniques, and the overall atmosphere created by the game together constitute the “Souls-like flavor” that players are fascinated by. This unique emotional experience can be summarized as “difficulty” and “exploration.”</p>
<p>“Difficulty” is the persistence of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s game aesthetics and the core part of the player experience. Previous “Souls” works, including the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, have the essence of allowing players to constantly learn in ridiculously difficult battles until they develop a suitable attack routine. The core experience is “gaining a sense of accomplishment by constantly overcoming difficulties.” Death is not just a sign of failure. When players continue to overcome difficulties in repeated deaths and finally achieve victory on their own, the previous deaths are given great meaning - constant death is for the sake of overcoming death.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fb52a1b19-2f5c-4744-850e-ae73e968532e.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls"></p>
<p>“Exploration” is also an important temperament of Souls-like games. The complex, grand, and mysterious things in Souls-like games make players instinctively want to pursue them. The fragmented narrative reveals the tip of the iceberg of the grand world, and the complex, hidden, and highly explorable map immerses players in this dark land. These designs encourage players to explore the world more carefully. In order to make the game more exploratory, Hidetaka Miyazaki has made a lot of information in the game fragmented, hidden, and complex. He does not want to give players too complete and clear things, but hopes that players will build their own world through their own exploration.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F07d568e4-145b-4c23-bd29-5d7757430092.png/size/" alt="Elden Ring Map"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fd629b6b0-8465-45f6-8356-ff98287917bf.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls Map"></p>
<h3 id="Apocalyptic-Aesthetic-World-Atmosphere"><a href="#Apocalyptic-Aesthetic-World-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Apocalyptic Aesthetic World Atmosphere"></a>Apocalyptic Aesthetic World Atmosphere</h3><p>For Souls-like games, its soul figure Hidetaka Miyazaki has been committed to expressing an “apocalyptic aesthetic” in the game: depressing and vast nights, decadent and grand buildings, the ignition and extinguishing of flames, the cycle of life and death… This kind of grand, ethereal, and depressing elements frequently appear in Souls-like games, constituting a unique Souls-like world.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Ff5a0cbd1-9264-42d6-b085-dbc48266de29.png/size/" alt="Dark Souls"></p>
<p>This apocalyptic aesthetic not only creates a very impactful emotional atmosphere for players, but also rationalizes the core experience of Souls-like games - “difficulty” and “exploration”. In a dark apocalypse, extremely difficult environments are taken for granted, and obscure information and areas awaiting exploration are also in line with the depressing and mysterious atmosphere of the apocalypse.</p>

<h2 id="2-Making-Overcoming-Difficulties-Fun"><a href="#2-Making-Overcoming-Difficulties-Fun" class="headerlink" title="2. Making Overcoming Difficulties Fun"></a>2. Making Overcoming Difficulties Fun</h2><h3 id="Using-Negative-Emotions-to-Enhance-Positive-Experiences"><a href="#Using-Negative-Emotions-to-Enhance-Positive-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Using Negative Emotions to Enhance Positive Experiences"></a>Using Negative Emotions to Enhance Positive Experiences</h3><p>How to design the sense of accomplishment in the game? Souls-like games give the answer by catalyzing the unparalleled joy and satisfaction after the final victory with the negative emotions of repeated failures. In order to give players a stronger game experience, Souls-like games allow players to experience oppressive, anxious, frustrated, and other negative emotions in extremely difficult battles, and encourage players to overcome this difficulty, so as to obtain a stronger sense of accomplishment and glory. That is, by means of first suppressing and then raising, making the depression more depressing and the happiness more joyful.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2F6ff44876-1847-47a1-ada1-da1a9216fac0.png/size/" alt="Achievement Feelings"></p>
<p>Although negative emotions can be a catalyst, they are ultimately an unpleasant experience for players. In order to prevent negative emotions from being too high and discouraging players, many skills need to be paid attention to in the design of negative emotions in the game to minimize their negative impact. For example, reward players when the enemy’s weaknesses are exposed to encourage them to continue the challenge. In <em>Sekiro</em>, there are usually ghost fire points very close to the boss battle to avoid repeatedly experiencing the boring process of running. High-difficulty bosses are usually isolated in a spacious area for players to concentrate on the battle.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220718%2Fcdeb745e-d86f-402a-91a0-1e231a9f4f2d.gif/size/" alt="Sekiro"></p>
<h3 id="Easy-Operation-Threshold-and-High-Difficulty-Enemy-Design"><a href="#Easy-Operation-Threshold-and-High-Difficulty-Enemy-Design" class="headerlink" title="Easy Operation Threshold and High-Difficulty Enemy Design"></a>Easy Operation Threshold and High-Difficulty Enemy Design</h3><p>Difficulty is an indelible feature of Souls-like games, giving Souls-like games a different kind of fun. This feeling of high difficulty does not come from complicated operations, but from enemy design.</p>
<p>Taking the <em>Dark Souls</em> series as an example, the basic operations of the game are not many. Simple four-direction movement and locking, attacks mainly use light attacks and heavy attacks, defense has blocking and parrying, dodging attacks has rolling, and switching weapons and magic. The core operations of most players are basically a combination of several common solutions, such as “slash + roll + counterattack”. Until <em>Elden Ring</em>, this easy-to-use operation logic is still very useful.</p>
<p>After the easy-to-use entry threshold, Souls-like games set extremely high-difficulty confrontations for players in the enemy design link. Souls-like games usually set a challenge with novel mechanisms and great difficulty. Usually, the game does not provide players with any clearance teaching. Players who want to overcome difficulties can only die and try repeatedly at the challenge until they master enough skills. Most of the boss enemies in <em>Sekiro</em> have unique fighting styles and novel attack methods. Players who face them for the first time hardly know how to defeat these bosses. Only through repeated death trials and errors can they improve their skills. This experience of learning how to fight in the death cycle is the essence of Souls-like games. Players repeatedly challenge the same difficulty, watching themselves progress step by step, producing wonderful chemical reactions emotionally, and bursting out with a surge of accomplishment when they finally overcome the challenge.</p>

<h2 id="3-Letting-Players-Breathe-in-Difficulty"><a href="#3-Letting-Players-Breathe-in-Difficulty" class="headerlink" title="3. Letting Players Breathe in Difficulty"></a>3. Letting Players Breathe in Difficulty</h2><p>According to the over-limit effect in psychology, there is an upper limit to a person’s tolerance for a certain emotion. If the player is in a depressed and frustrated mood in the game for a long time, and there is no [loose] rhythm control, then the player will feel very tired. Although difficulty is the soul of Souls-like games that cannot be separated, it is also necessary to set up a breathing space for players. By designing high-degree-of-freedom coping methods, players are helped to persevere in difficulties.</p>
<p>In the design of the difficulty curve, Souls-like games often give many opportunities to escape in the early and mid-term in order to allow players to learn to explore the enemy’s routines more smoothly and enter the challenge mode. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, this progress is more obvious. Players can ride a horse to escape a failed battle. If one road is too difficult, they can choose another.</p>
<p>In addition, players have a variety of challenge methods when attacking bosses, and even have particularly easy countermeasures. For example, the famous newcomer killer, The Pursuer, in <em>Dark Souls 2</em>, can be dealt with by rolling away from most of the attacks by hiding in the position where he holds the shield, or by escaping to his birthplace and shooting with a ballista. A variety of coping methods not only further enhance the strategy of the game, but also make the player’s perception of difficulty more flexible, further reducing the possibility of players being discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Hidetaka Miyazaki, the soul figure of Souls-like games, believes that death is not meaningless. The Souls-like games he produced are always full of the propositions of “death and rebirth”, “attempt and overcoming”. He insists on apocalyptic aesthetics and insists on using extremely difficult experiences to touch the hearts of the audience. Perhaps it is this special persistence that keeps Souls-like games very strong in this era. We also need to see what efforts Hidetaka Miyazaki has made behind this persistence in order to make the player experience more complete.</p>

    <title>&#39;Can someone help Kurumi?&#39; — Are Female Characters in Games Really Weak?</title>
    <url>/2022/07/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20220720_28584_1031927/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220720/28584_1031927.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Can someone help Kurumi?” — This is the most famous line of the hero Kurumi (Hu Tao) in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Kurumi is always easily targeted and besieged by enemies on the battlefield, and her classic voice line is also used very frequently, becoming a well-known mantra among <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> players.</p>
<p>But, is Kurumi really weak?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the actual combat situation: In an impressive trio match in last autumn’s Naraka Championship, Bilibili Gaming (BKG) player Huya丶niko saved his teammates at the last critical moment. He turned the tide with Kurumi and won the title of “God of War”. In daily games, many skilled players also say that Kurumi’s solo hero ranking is the most difficult, but also the most challenging.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that Kurumi is difficult to operate, but if played well, she can bring infinite possibilities to the team. High-level Kurumi players often become the “mastermind” of a team. It can be seen that Kurumi is not really weak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe0fbdced-8e98-4e79-8705-c1d9fb72c0ae.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e0fbdced-8e98-4e79-8705-c1d9fb72c0ae.png"></p>

<p><em>Huya丶niko won the title of “God of War” in the Naraka Championship</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why do players often habitually think that these female characters are usually in a weak position in the game and need help? This article will analyze the positioning and changes of female characters in games in recent years from the following three aspects, and whether they are really “weak”.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Image-and-Positioning-of-Female-Characters-in-Early-Games"><a href="#1-The-Image-and-Positioning-of-Female-Characters-in-Early-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Image and Positioning of Female Characters in Early Games"></a>1. The Image and Positioning of Female Characters in Early Games</h2><p>In some early game works, there were indeed many female game characters who really “needed to be saved by others to survive”.</p>
<h3 id="The-Universal-Narrative-Formula-of-“Saving-the-Maiden”"><a href="#The-Universal-Narrative-Formula-of-“Saving-the-Maiden”" class="headerlink" title="The Universal Narrative Formula of “Saving the Maiden”"></a>The Universal Narrative Formula of “Saving the Maiden”</h3><p>Whether it’s the frequent appearance of “saving the kidnapped Peach” in the Super Mario series, or “finding the crystal and saving the princess” in the Zelda series, I believe many players are familiar with it. In fact, there are many similar plots of saving Princess Peach - Damsel in Distress is a relatively common narrative framework in early games. It comes from the French Demoiselle en Détresse, which can be simply translated as “a maiden in danger”. In such narratives, regardless of whether the female character has combat power, they are often in a helpless image of danger in the story, and are often set as the core incentive or motivation for the male protagonist to start the adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe0188a87-eb35-4254-ae6e-487ef906bfe2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e0188a87-eb35-4254-ae6e-487ef906bfe2.png"></p>
<p>These female characters usually appear as princesses, wives or sisters of male protagonists. When analyzing such female characters, the subject&#x2F;object dichotomy is usually used, that is, the subject acts and the object is acted upon. The subject can be understood as the protagonist, the central character of the story, and generally the main playable character in the game. In the Damsel in Distress narrative, it is usually assumed that the male is the subject and the female is placed in the role of the object. In the game, she usually becomes “the reward to be won”, “the treasure to be found”, or “the goal to be achieved”.</p>
<h3 id="The-Gender-Perspective-Behind-the-Story-Narration"><a href="#The-Gender-Perspective-Behind-the-Story-Narration" class="headerlink" title="The Gender Perspective Behind the Story Narration"></a>The Gender Perspective Behind the Story Narration</h3><p>The story narration of a game can usually reflect the perspective of the game maker and the worldview they want to express, and it will inevitably be reflected in the game. <em>Grand Theft Auto (GTA)</em>‘s gender controversy, objectification of female characters, and lack of inclusivity are often criticized: there are no female characters that can be played in the first person, no female characters that can influence the main storyline, and most female NPCs are also labeled with a single “sexy” tag. Every main poster of <em>GTA</em> must have a woman wearing overly revealing clothes, and the protagonist’s wife in the game is also set as a stripper.</p>
<p>Whether it is a game or a film and television work, if you want players to be immersed, a sense of story substitution is essential. Imagine, if female characters in the game can be arbitrarily abused, how will female players feel? Are the female game characters labeled “sexy” and “weak” a stereotype or an invisible misogynistic tendency? Nearly half of the game players in the United States are women, while women account for only 24% of the game developer group. Should the roles of women be presented by female practitioners to be more reasonable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fc3ec7333-431d-44fe-b3c8-6853ed5023d2.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;c3ec7333-431d-44fe-b3c8-6853ed5023d2.png"></p>

<h3 id="Changes-in-the-Image-of-Women-in-Games-in-the-Past-20-Years"><a href="#Changes-in-the-Image-of-Women-in-Games-in-the-Past-20-Years" class="headerlink" title="Changes in the Image of Women in Games in the Past 20 Years"></a>Changes in the Image of Women in Games in the Past 20 Years</h3><p>In the 80s and 90s, the plot of “saving the distressed girl” once became a cliché in video games. Whether it was action fighting, role-playing, or first-person shooters, people were keen to add this old-fashioned but “effective” plot formula, and enjoyed it. And now, the old-fashioned plot of “saving the princess” and “saving the girl” has long been criticized and abandoned by the times.</p>
<p>In the past nearly 20 years, a significant change in female characters in games is playability. In the earliest video games, many female characters existed only to promote the plot. And now, female characters are no longer a kind of “accessory” or “catalyst”, but one of the game protagonists with combat capabilities, with maximum playability and controllability. EEDAR (Electronic Entertainment Design and Research) company counted in 2021 that 45% of 669 games, that is, 300 games, allow players to operate female characters, but there are 369 games that can only play male characters, and only 24 games can only play female characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fbe0f41a9-1c91-40ec-a720-d8c2d89c35ee.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;be0f41a9-1c91-40ec-a720-d8c2d89c35ee.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Apex Legends》</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the point of gender balance and diversity, <em>Apex Legends</em> is an excellent model, achieving a high degree of balance in the proportion of hero gender and race. Bloodhound is called “they”, is it a male or a female? There are different opinions about the gender of this mysterious hunter, and some people say that ta is actually the only non-binary gender in the game.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Female-Characters-Like-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Female-Characters-Like-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Female Characters Like in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>2. What are the Female Characters Like in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><h3 id="Breaking-Stereotypes-The-Strong-in-the-Game-World"><a href="#Breaking-Stereotypes-The-Strong-in-the-Game-World" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Stereotypes - The Strong in the Game World"></a>Breaking Stereotypes - The Strong in the Game World</h3><p>In early games, the subjective consciousness of most female characters was often ignored. After being imprisoned, kidnapped, and cursed, did they never think of resisting or breaking free from the shackles of fate? Maybe they did, but the game setting often did not allow them to “escape successfully” until the male protagonist arrived. In recent years, in games, we can not only see that the stereotype of “the princess to be rescued” is being broken, but more importantly, more and more female game characters are changing their fate through their own struggles, rather than waiting in place to be “rescued”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F50eb5861-24a3-460e-976d-14266e0ccea5.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;50eb5861-24a3-460e-976d-14266e0ccea5.png"></p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, whether it is playability, the positioning of female characters, or the self-awareness of characters, they are completely different from the weak images in past games. Of the twelve heroes currently open in the game, female characters account for half, each with talent skills that can mutually check and balance all heroes. Another breakthrough worth noting is that Yoto Hime (Ning Hongye), as the main promotional image of the game, is a female hero, and becomes the default protagonist in the novice tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fb5c68310-f85a-487d-9dec-c936476f4df4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;b5c68310-f85a-487d-9dec-c936476f4df4.png"></p>
<p>In the character background story of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the image of the female hero portrayed is very distinct and three-dimensional, with both a sense of power and combat effectiveness. There is the unyielding, beautiful and dangerous red snake, the swordsman Yoto Hime; the ghostly assassin Viper Ning (Jia Nan) who haunts the desert; the ambitious and resourceful sea overlord Tsuchimikado Kurumi (Cui Sanniang); and the ranger Justina Gu (Gu Qinghan) who was born as an imperial princess but wanders the world to bury her enemies in blood. Whether it is the Kunlun Goddess, the Desert Blackhawk, the Flower of Heliothis, or the Dragon King of the Mist Sea, these titles given to them all imply that they are “the strong” in their respective fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F02775539-6fae-4d22-8684-4b03bf9ffba7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;02775539-6fae-4d22-8684-4b03bf9ffba7.png"></p>
<h3 id="“My-Fate-is-up-to-Me”"><a href="#“My-Fate-is-up-to-Me”" class="headerlink" title="“My Fate is up to Me”"></a>“My Fate is up to Me”</h3><p>If analyzed by the subject-object dichotomy, they are undoubtedly the central subject of the game. Not only that, in the description of the hero’s legend, we can see their growth line and determination to become strong. For example, in the prologue of Tsuchimikado Kurumi’s hero story, her original words are “The weak can only drift with the tide and eventually be swallowed by the sea.” “And the strong will steer their own course, ride the wind and waves, and reach the shore of victory.” In many details of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, from the hero story to the description of an appearance, it is not difficult to see that female characters are given more dominant positions, and their own awareness of resistance is awakened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fc0b8a8d8-64e4-40d2-bc7e-d04f249bbf4b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;c0b8a8d8-64e4-40d2-bc7e-d04f249bbf4b.png"></p>
<h3 id="Seemingly-Weak-But-Can-Also-Be-a-“Savior”"><a href="#Seemingly-Weak-But-Can-Also-Be-a-“Savior”" class="headerlink" title="Seemingly Weak, But Can Also Be a “Savior”"></a>Seemingly Weak, But Can Also Be a “Savior”</h3><p>Finally, back to Kurumi. After several versions of iterations, although Kurumi’s skills and positioning have been repeatedly adjusted and modified, when it comes to Kurumi, players will not easily say the word “easy”. Although she has been beaten all the time, she is also very strong, and she must always judge the situation to support her teammates, and find opportunities to help dismantle the fire when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="3-Pay-Attention-to-Female-Players-and-Female-Characters-in-Games"><a href="#3-Pay-Attention-to-Female-Players-and-Female-Characters-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Pay Attention to Female Players and Female Characters in Games"></a>3. Pay Attention to Female Players and Female Characters in Games</h2><p>In fact, in current video games, the presence and importance of female characters are increasing. The ESA found in a survey that 48% of the surveyed players were women. Recently, a MOBA game producer also shared an interesting piece of data on Reddit, 97% of female players will only choose female characters, while the ratio of male players choosing male and female characters is 50% to 50%.</p>
<p>More and more players will choose female characters, which also requires game makers to set female characters from an equal perspective. Compared with the labeled masculinity and femininity, what is more important is how to define female characters - she can be a father’s daughter, a husband’s wife, a younger brother’s sister, but she should be herself more, and she can overcome difficulties, explore and conquer the world like other male characters.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In the setting of female game characters, many games no longer label them with stereotypes of traditional game females such as “weak”, “need to be rescued”, “accessories of the male protagonist”, etc. They are the protagonists themselves, brave, loyal, wise, powerful, and exemplary. Compared with some of the criticized Damsel in Distress settings in the early days, this is undoubtedly a forward-looking breakthrough and progress.</p>
<p>As the population of female game players is constantly growing, we believe that paying attention to and improving the situation of female characters in games, and then extending to exploring the needs of female players, will also be an important topic for user research. The importance of female players in today’s game market is obvious, and these newly emerging female players need respect and recognition from the game culture. By combining their demographic information, psycho-social environment, and the game culture they belong to, we user researchers have more directions worth studying.</p>

<p>In recent years, the domestic game user market in China has become saturated, and the user dividend has gradually disappeared. However, game manufacturers still regard the domestic market as the main distribution market, resulting in the incremental market gradually becoming a stock market. There are structural development opportunities in the international market, with huge potential. Many game manufacturers have begun to turn their attention overseas, seeking opportunities for games to go global.</p>
<p>South Korea, as a country with a top-ranking game market scale in Asia and even globally, has become one of the must-select markets for game companies from various countries due to its developed game industry, mature e-sports ecosystem, and strong player spending power. In recent years, many Chinese games have also achieved excellent results in the Korean market. In 2021, among the games released overseas by China, 33 entered the Top 100 Korean mobile games by revenue, with revenue reaching US$980 million, accounting for 22.3% of the Top 100 total revenue. In recent years, more and more overseas games and IPs have entered the Korean market, and competition has become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Going overseas has become an important strategic choice for most game companies. Before going overseas, understanding the corresponding market environment and user characteristics is an indispensable link. By familiarizing yourself with the characteristics of the market and avoiding cultural conflicts, you can avoid detours and effectively occupy market advantages. This article will analyze the Korean game market with huge potential and provide relevant localization optimization suggestions.</p>

In 2019, the scale of the Korean game market ranked fifth in the world, and in 2020, it surpassed the United Kingdom and became the fourth largest game market in the world, second only to the United States, China, and Japan.</p>

In 2020, the scale of the Korean game market increased by 21.3%, reaching 18.9 trillion won (approximately RMB 100 billion). The main reason for the growth of the game industry in 2020 is the increase in indoor activities due to the impact of the epidemic. (Data source: 2021 Korean Game White Paper)</p>
<p>The scale of the Korean game market has maintained a continuous growth trend since 2014. In 2021, it even exceeded 20 trillion won (approximately 107 billion yuan), setting a new record for the Korean game market. In 2023, it is likely to form a large-scale market of 23.46 trillion won (approximately 125.4 billion yuan).</p>

<p>In mobile game revenue, South Korea’s three major game manufacturers “3N” (NCSOFT, Nexon, Netmarble) still lead the mobile game market. NCSOFT’s Lineage IP games occupy the upstream, and Nexon’s “The Kingdom of the Winds”, “KartRider Rush+” and other games are also very impressive. However, in 2021, after the launch of Kakao’s “Odin: Valhalla Rising”, NCSOFT’s revenue decreased due to word-of-mouth and other factors; Nexon had no new blockbuster games launched, and the performance of old games was sluggish, and revenue continued to decline; although Netmarble had “Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds” launched, the game did not bring revenue growth. In 2021, the three major Korean manufacturers failed to achieve breakthrough growth, and their influence gradually declined, while domestic game manufacturers in China are catching up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F106cc82c-6ebe-4144-a387-224a5f2dca40.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;106cc82c-6ebe-4144-a387-224a5f2dca40.png"></p>
<p>The scale of the PC game market decreased slightly by 4% compared with the previous year. The main reasons are the relatively high R&amp;D costs of PC games, the gradual shift of users to mobile games, and the reduction of new games. The report predicts that the scale of the Korean PC game market will stagnate or decline in the future. The revenue of Korean Internet cafes in 2020 was also affected by the epidemic, down 11.9%.</p>
<p>The sales of the console game market increased by 57.3% compared with the previous year, with a large increase. It is speculated that the explosive growth of console games was mainly affected by the popularity of Nintendo Switch and “Animal Crossing”. In addition, more and more manufacturers are porting mobile or computer games to consoles, with a focus on indie games. With the increase of Korean companies such as Pearl Abyss and Smilegate that develop console masterpieces, the Korean console game market will continue to maintain a high growth momentum in the future. It is estimated that the sales of the console game market in 2021 will increase by 17.3% compared with the previous year, reaching 1.2815 trillion won (this is predicted data, the real data has not yet been disclosed).</p>
<p>In the past two years, “3N” has successively announced its strategic console games. For example, NCSOFT will launch the massively multiplayer online role-playing game “Throne and Liberty”, NEXON will launch the racing game “KartRider: Drift” in the form of a console, and Netmarble launched “Seven Knights: Time Wanderer” in 2020, which ported its masterpiece “Seven Knights” to the console game platform Switch. It is not difficult to see that the reason why “3N” is tightening the reins of entering the console game is related to the stagnation of the market in its existing main areas and the huge potential of the console market.</p>
<h2 id="3-User-Portrait-of-Korean-Players"><a href="#3-User-Portrait-of-Korean-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. User Portrait of Korean Players"></a>3. User Portrait of Korean Players</h2><p>According to Newzoo’s statistics on the age structure of players around the world in 2022, 46% of Korean players are 18-34 years old, and more than 50% of players are over 35 years old. The overall age of players is older. Older players have high spending power, which also determines the strong willingness of Korean players to spend on games.</p>
<h3 id="PC-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-Players-is-Significantly-Higher-Than-That-of-Female-Players"><a href="#PC-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-Players-is-Significantly-Higher-Than-That-of-Female-Players" class="headerlink" title="PC Game Players: The Proportion of Male Players is Significantly Higher Than That of Female Players"></a>PC Game Players: The Proportion of Male Players is Significantly Higher Than That of Female Players</h3><p>Among Korean game players, the usage rate of PC games is 59.1%.</p>

<p>● PC Game Genre Preferences:</p>
<p>From the perspective of the game genres that PC game players often experience, the top five game genres are RPG&#x2F;MMORPG, FPS&#x2F;TPS, Simulation, AOS, and Sports. Players aged 20-30 prefer to play games such as “League of Legends”, “PUBG”, “FIFA”, and “Overwatch”. The younger the players, the higher the proportion of experiencing AOS and racing genres, and they also prefer to play games with friends; from the perspective of gender, female players prefer games such as simulation, racing, and puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="Mobile-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-and-Female-Players-is-Basically-the-Same"><a href="#Mobile-Game-Players-The-Proportion-of-Male-and-Female-Players-is-Basically-the-Same" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Game Players: The Proportion of Male and Female Players is Basically the Same"></a>Mobile Game Players: The Proportion of Male and Female Players is Basically the Same</h3><p>Among Korean game players, the usage rate of mobile games is 91.1%.</p>
<p>In the gender distribution of mobile game players, the proportion of male players is 50.7%, and the proportion of female players is 49.3%. The proportion of males and females is basically the same, each accounting for half. Compared with China, which is also an Asian country, the proportion of male and female players in South Korea is more balanced: among Chinese mobile game players, males account for 61.7% and females account for 38.3%, with males significantly higher than females.</p>

<p>Compared with mobile game players, there are fewer young players in console games, which is also related to spending power and family environment. The development of the Korean console market is relatively late compared with the United States and Japan. In the 1990s, Japan occupied the console market, but because of cultural restrictions in South Korea, it was also difficult to import games, and the development of the console market was relatively slow. And most Korean families have TVs in the living room. Without the consent of family members, it is impossible to enjoy console games in the living room, which also has certain restrictions on students’ experience of console games.</p>

Characteristics of the Korean Mobile Game Market"></a>4. Characteristics of the Korean Mobile Game Market</h2><h3 id="Mainly-MMORPG-Genre"><a href="#Mainly-MMORPG-Genre" class="headerlink" title="Mainly MMORPG Genre"></a>Mainly MMORPG Genre</h3><p>Compared with China, the Korean mobile game market has lower diversity and is mainly MMORPG. In 2021, among the Top 3 Korean mobile games by revenue, the sales of the MMORPG genre accounted for 70%. Among them, the sales of Lineage IP games accounted for more than 30%.</p>
<p>South Korea can be said to be the holy land of MMORPG. There is also a saying that it is “Korean-made MMORPG”. Why is this game genre so popular in South Korea? What are the reasons? What are the characteristics of Korean MMORPGs? The following points are summarized for these questions.</p>
<p>● The Influence of Korea’s First Generation MMORPG</p>
<p>When it comes to Korean MMORPG, we must mention “The Kingdom of the Winds” and “Lineage”. “The Kingdom of the Winds” is a PC game developed and published by NEXON in 1996. This year marks its 26th anniversary. It is the world’s longest-running and representative first multiplayer online game in the history of Korean games. The game also created a lot of innovative gameplay, including resurrection, purchase-type growth and other systems. After reaching the full level, you will not continue to upgrade, but you can provide continuous growth motivation by purchasing HP&#x2F;MP, hunting to obtain additional experience, etc. This form is also used in current games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2Fe50e2a46-11a7-4bd4-850a-06744c08ef14.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;e50e2a46-11a7-4bd4-850a-06744c08ef14.jpg"></p>
<p>“Lineage” is a PC game developed and published by NCSOFT in 1998. At that time, “Lineage” had two main highlights. The first was the picture quality&#x2F;sound effects, and the second was the siege warfare. It induced competition among players through a relatively free PVP mode, and you could obtain props by killing other players. The unprecedented siege warfare system aroused the players’ sense of team honor, and the blood alliance system provided players with a sense of belonging. After these two games achieved great success in South Korea, MMORPG seems to have become the preferred game genre for other Korean manufacturers. After 2000, games such as “Black Desert”, “Mabinogi”, “MU Online”, and “Lineage” series were launched successively. With the explosion of the mobile game market, these PC games have successively launched mobile games with the same IP.</p>
<p>● Characteristics of Korean MMORPG - Highlighting of Hunting Gameplay and Convenient Operation</p>
<p>Compared with other overseas games of the same type, Korean MMORPGs emphasize hunting gameplay more. From the perspective of R&amp;D, development resources can be saved. Instead of creating a brand new gameplay, adding monsters and maps can achieve hunting gameplay. Players who have experienced the “Lineage” PC game in the past have long been accustomed to Lineage-style simple operations, while complex operations and diverse skill systems, which require familiarity with precise strategies and continuous long-term operations in multiplayer battles, will not be favored by these players over 40 years old. Therefore, this simple Korean-style operation method has become a representative feature of Lineage. This very strong preference has formed a fixed model in the Korean market, and the hunting gameplay can obtain effective returns in a low-cost way, which also meets their needs.</p>
<h3 id="Android-Revenue-Accounts-for-More-Than-70"><a href="#Android-Revenue-Accounts-for-More-Than-70" class="headerlink" title="Android Revenue Accounts for More Than 70%"></a>Android Revenue Accounts for More Than 70%</h3><p>The paid platforms for Korean mobile games are Google Play, App Store, and One Store, with revenue shares of 73.8%, 11.8%, and 14.8%, respectively. The proportion of the Google Play platform is relatively high, which is related to the high popularity of Android system phones. In the Korean mobile phone operating system market in 2021, the Android system accounted for 72.6%, and the IOS system accounted for 27.1%.</p>

<h3 id="Monopoly-of-Top-Games"><a href="#Monopoly-of-Top-Games" class="headerlink" title="Monopoly of Top Games"></a>Monopoly of Top Games</h3><p>In 2021, the games ranked in the top ten in sales accounted for 50% of the Top 100. Similar to the Chinese market, there is a phenomenon of monopoly of top games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F2d85191b-3f1c-4996-b74a-046249df5595.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;2d85191b-3f1c-4996-b74a-046249df5595.png"></p>
<h2 id="5-Localization-Suggestions"><a href="#5-Localization-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="5. Localization Suggestions"></a>5. Localization Suggestions</h2><h3 id="Game-Art-Style-and-Picture-Quality"><a href="#Game-Art-Style-and-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Game Art Style and Picture Quality"></a>Game Art Style and Picture Quality</h3><p>Most Korean game players prefer European and American realistic, fantasy, Nordic and other styles. Many Korean players will directly give up experiencing the game because of the game style. Therefore, game manufacturers need to consider the audience of the game style when going overseas to Korea. Game picture quality has a greater impact on Korean players. In the MMORPG mobile game player game experience survey, the demand for “high-quality pictures” is much higher than other options, accounting for 30.4%, diverse gameplay accounts for 15%, and fast and simple experience accounts for 13.7%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220720%2F20ee40dc-fdf1-4a1d-94b5-8560abb3c644.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220720&#x2F;20ee40dc-fdf1-4a1d-94b5-8560abb3c644.png"></p>
<h3 id="Text"><a href="#Text" class="headerlink" title="Text"></a>Text</h3><p>Korean game players have higher requirements for the text in the game. Players will point out typos, machine translations, and system display errors in the game, and will also evaluate the character names and plot translations. If the game is released globally, there will be communication and interaction between overseas players. Character names also need to consider the communication problems of players from various countries in the game, and try to ensure consistency. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider local cultural customs, holidays, etc. If you want to succeed in the Korean game market, improving the overall translation quality is also an indispensable link.</p>
<h3 id="UI-Section"><a href="#UI-Section" class="headerlink" title="UI Section"></a>UI Section</h3><p>Compared with Chinese games, most Korean game UI interfaces are relatively simpler. Therefore, when entering the Korean market, the UI interface can be appropriately simplified and optimized, which may be more in line with the gaming habits of Korean users.</p>

<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The Korean game market has an extremely important position in the world, and it has also become one of the regions that Chinese game manufacturers must focus on when going overseas. However, it has very unique features in terms of game categories, player preferences, player portraits, and localization. Therefore, when considering going overseas to Korea and Korean localization, you can investigate the prospects of overseas game categories, player preferences, etc. in advance to lay the foundation for successful distribution in Korea.</p>

    <title>It&#39;s 2022, are People Still Interested in Large-Scale Guild Wars?</title>
    <url>/2022/07/21/netease-ux-articles/news_20220722_28584_1032528/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220722/28584_1032528.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “Territory War” in games might remind people of national warfare at first glance. In this era that increasingly values personalization, exploration, creative fun, and the rise of the ACG (Anime, Comics, and Games) subculture, this type of gameplay sounds like something popular in the last decade. So, are people still interested in this kind of gameplay that emphasizes strong organization and weak individual play?</p>
<p>Territory War, or what everyone calls “national warfare,” is not a fixed concept. It is a general term for large-scale multiplayer online PK activities. In the early days, most of these types of gameplay used the “nation (server)&#x2F;city-state” in the game as the participating unit. Over time, “national warfare” has become synonymous with this type of gameplay.</p>
<p>In the current game market, such activities often appear in MMORPG games. Their manifestation is often in the form of guilds. Some games also have an alliance&#x2F;faction level above the guild, and they compete for territory&#x2F;land. Occupying territories of different levels will bring different rewards to their guilds and affiliated factions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Characteristics-of-Territory-War"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-Territory-War" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of Territory War"></a>1.

The final reward content is generally high-value development props, or even gameplay-exclusive numerical props.</p>

<p><em>“Justice Online Mobile” Heaven and Earth Board Game map, 8 guilds on one map compete for 1 level 4 main city</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Some games have multiple different attack and defense points in each area, and each point has offensive significance; some have only one battlefield in an area. Different games have different map designs and their corresponding point occupation rules. Relatively speaking, the fewer the battlefields, the more groups competing in a single battlefield, the higher the density of combat personnel on the same screen, and the more intense the battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Fe253f902-b954-4a04-8f49-77c5bc9afbfa.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;e253f902-b954-4a04-8f49-77c5bc9afbfa.png"></p>

<h3 id="The-guild-is-the-smallest-unit-of-participation"><a href="#The-guild-is-the-smallest-unit-of-participation" class="headerlink" title="The guild is the smallest unit of participation."></a>The guild is the smallest unit of participation.</h3><p>Territory War takes the guild as the smallest unit of participation. Individuals&#x2F;fixed teams and other smaller player units cannot participate. Some games also have an alliance&#x2F;faction level above the guild. The degree of reward sharing and reward value within the faction are different, which will affect the loose-tight organization of different guilds within the faction, which also creates different territory war ecologies.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, the smallest participating unit in the Territory War is the guild. Each guild must choose its own faction. Within the faction, they cannot attack each other or attack the territories they have occupied. The battle results between guilds in the faction are not shared. Instead, factions need to compete for faction rankings. The guild ranked first in the faction can become the alliance leader guild, and the alliance leader guild can receive an additional alliance leader guild reward (high value).</p>
<p>The degree of reward sharing among guilds in the same faction is not high, and there is also a competitive relationship for high-value rewards. Therefore, in <em>Revelation M</em>, there is often no atmosphere of sharing a common hatred within the same faction. The core of the game is still the ecology of expansion and competition with the guild as the unit. And there will not necessarily be mutual help within the same faction. In some cases, there will also be spies sent by enemy guilds within the faction (after the enemy robs the guild’s territory, the spies will plant flags. Because the territory of the same faction guild cannot be robbed, this method is used to encroach on the guild’s territory) .</p>

<h3 id="There-is-a-certain-tactical-space-not-only-requiring-combat-skills"><a href="#There-is-a-certain-tactical-space-not-only-requiring-combat-skills" class="headerlink" title="There is a certain tactical space, not only requiring combat skills."></a>There is a certain tactical space, not only requiring combat skills.</h3><p>Looking at the above two points alone, you may think that Territory War is to add guild units to the battlefield, or a PLUS version of the guild league with a larger map and allowing more people to participate. The difference in experience from these two is that Territory War has greater tactical space. Compared with ordinary team battles (leagues or wild team PK), it pays more attention to how to deploy troops. Due to the complex terrain and diverse mechanisms of Territory War, in addition to combat skills, it is also necessary to consider whether to choose feint attacks, lure the enemy, or other large-scale overall tactics.</p>
<p>Taking the <em>Revelation M</em> Territory War mechanism as an example, it may be easier for everyone to feel what this tactical space refers to.</p>
<p>[Map mechanism] There are a total of 3 large strongholds and 8 small strongholds in the gameplay. Each stronghold can accommodate up to 300 people from the same faction. After a player dies 6 times in a stronghold, he will be resurrected outside the stronghold. Specifically, each stronghold has its own running route. Different entrances, the location of the opponent’s large group, whether the Zulong Seal platform is currently stationed, predicting where the opponent may intercept our attack on the road, and how to divide the troops to outflank will also have different effects.</p>
<p>Take the large point of East Sea Barrier as an example. There are 4 entrances. There are 5 common attack routes, and each route has its own characteristics. For example, the back door has the shortest running distance to the platform, but from the back door to the Right Tower Square is a long slope. If the opponent charges from top to bottom, the large group here is likely to be directly killed 6 times by the opponent before gathering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F6ddbe425-9393-4d94-8440-48400d50ea42.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;6ddbe425-9393-4d94-8440-48400d50ea42.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Overhead view of East Sea Barrier and the back door route of East Sea. It takes 1 minute to teleport from the back door to Zulong Seal. Successfully occupying the area means planting the guild’s Zulong Seal in the center</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Due to the running map and map restrictions, in the game, who is currently occupying each stronghold, whether their main force is stationed in the stronghold, which stronghold the guild chooses to attack, whether it is a small team stealing points or a large group pressing, whether it is violent output frontal pressure or tactical flanking raid Zulong Seal, predicting the number of resurrections of the opponent’s main force during the stalemate, etc., are all variables that need to be considered.</p>
<p>[Dispatch mechanism] In addition, the gameplay also has a matching dispatch mechanism, which allows tactics to play more tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vanguard mechanism</strong>, the vanguard can transform into a mecha, and the mecha can greatly increase the damage of Zulong Seal, increasing the breakthrough power for stealing seals.</li>
<li><strong>Unified command mechanism</strong>, unified command can use the guild-wide map summoning skill to quickly gather all guild members around the unified command (skill CD is 5 minutes)</li>
<li><strong>Alliance leader mechanism</strong>, the guild with the highest guild contribution in the same faction will become the alliance leader guild, and the president can use the alliance leader skill to summon members of this faction to teleport to his side.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your guild is the alliance leader guild, then you have two mechanisms: unified command summoning and alliance leader summoning. At the same time, the actual commander of the Territory War does not need to be the unified command or the president. Therefore, in actual combat, it is often the commander who contacts the scouts on a single line, and according to the intelligence given by the scouts, contacts the current person in charge of unified command and president on a single line, and asks them to hide in a certain position in the stronghold according to the situation, and pull the summoning at a critical moment to carry out a surprise attack. Here, there can be N kinds of strategy combinations.</p>

This sense of game allows players to deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.”</h3><p>Next, I will review a Territory War that I once watched, which may make everyone feel the high degree of freedom in the Territory War.</p>
<p>In this battle, the UP master was at a disadvantage. The combat power level of both sides can be roughly understood as: enemy guild &gt; our guild (the UP master’s guild is hereinafter referred to as “our side”) &gt; enemy’s second guild. Since a guild can only occupy one large point, there are 10 minutes left before the end of the Territory War at this time. The enemy guild and the enemy’s second guild are in the same faction, each occupying a large point. Previously, our guild had launched attacks on both large points, but they were defeated by the enemy’s large group and could not be captured. Our commander speculated that the enemy should adopt a guaranteed tactic and leave a summoner in both large points. Based on this speculation, our commander started a feint in the last 10 minutes.</p>
<p>① Our side pretended to give up the large point and gathered a large group to attack the small point, attracting some of the opponent’s main force to interfere, deliberately receiving the summon in front of the opponent, so that the opponent found that we were going to sneak attack the Praying Temple.</p>
<p>② According to the terrain characteristics of the Praying Temple’s long tunnel, our commander predicted that the opponent would pull the order back to defend after being attacked. As expected, the enemy urgently pulled the summon back to defend, successfully defrauding the opponent’s summon CD here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Fb4ae153d-c641-4739-b1cc-f5fe3324c1cf.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;b4ae153d-c641-4739-b1cc-f5fe3324c1cf.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Overhead view of the Praying Temple, the tunnel is long, and it takes about 2-3 minutes to actually run to the center point</em></p>
<hr>
<p>③ Our commander asked everyone to switch to the back door of East Sea Barrier, and used the advantage of the back door of East Sea Barrier to run to the location, quickly pushing to the place where Zulong Seal was located, deceiving the opponent’s large group to leave the Praying Temple.</p>
<p>④ At this time, there were 4 minutes left before the end of the Territory War. Our side once again pulled the summon next to the Zulong Seal of the Praying Temple. Using the time difference that the opponent’s large group needed to run through the tunnel to defend, the occupation of the Praying Temple was completed. At this time, the activity was nearing its end, and it was too late for the opponent to arrive and destroy our Zulong Seal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F5be17657-aab2-4e32-85e1-8e0b2b85ca51.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;5be17657-aab2-4e32-85e1-8e0b2b85ca51.png"></p>
<p>Under the multi-layered operation of the commander, the UP master side completed the reversal of winning more with less when the overall strength was weaker than the opponent. Compared with leagues and large group battles, the unique tactical space of Territory War can provide a high degree of freedom in strategic experience. This sense of game also makes players deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.” Of course, this also requires higher capabilities of the Territory War commander. If the command is not good and the tactics are not good, many players feel that they “don’t know what they are doing throughout the whole process.”</p>

Members with special tasks contact the commander privately by voice and private messages, and members without special tasks receive unified dispatch. The premise that tactics can be implemented well and played beautifully is the cooperation between various units, which is obedience and efficient response to each player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Fb4fefdb2-3315-4ddf-a940-8ab22b3ed07f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;b4fefdb2-3315-4ddf-a940-8ab22b3ed07f.png"></p>
<p>In actual Territory War, because there will always be undercover agents mixed in the group to inquire about information, the commander will hardly tell everyone the overall tactics on the microphone, nor will he reveal the analysis in his mind. He will only give clear instructions on what to do at present according to the current judgment. This kind of high-confrontation pressure situation will make all participants unconsciously and actively obey the instructions, not question the received instructions, but just try their best to execute them. In this process, players with a high degree of cooperation will automatically internalize the goals of the commander&#x2F;guild management into one of their own goals for participating in the activity. In addition to relying on social interaction, common interests, and common experiences to unite team members, the guild also adds a strong buff of “common goals.”</p>
<p>“Everyone has their own tasks” allows players to confirm that they are part of the organization. “High obedience in confrontational pressure situations” weakens players’ self-perception. The two interact with each other, allowing players to consciously or unconsciously form “common goals” with the collective. The three together strengthen players’ sense of belonging to the collective. In this process, players strive to achieve common goals, make contributions, and even make some sacrifices (investing more time and money) also make them feel their moral emotions of fulfilling obligations, making contributions, and striving for honor for the collective, which is what we often call collective honor.</p>

Will Young Players Still be Interested in this Old-fashioned Gameplay?"></a>3. Will Young Players Still be Interested in this Old-fashioned Gameplay?</h2><p>High strategy and militarized participation experience, these features that sound both heavy and impersonal, are indeed significantly different from the fun of self-expression, creation, and exploration that young people pursue, which is often mentioned in mainstream media. However, in actual research, we found that although the age distribution of players who like team battles is indeed older than that of players who prefer exploration&#x2F;high degree of freedom, if you look at the proportion, there are still many young players who are interested in team battles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F23656224-1fa3-434c-8c17-36562cbb7671.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;23656224-1fa3-434c-8c17-36562cbb7671.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In a certain survey of a certain game, the distribution of players who claimed to like large-scale team battle PK, competitive operations, and exploration.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We found something when doing related research. Many players who like Territory War are not interested in this kind of large-scale team battle at first. The less intuitive fun brought by this complex mechanism often makes them feel good after experiencing it. After experiencing intense, difficult, or reversed team battles, new players experience high-energy moments with clear goals and intense battles. In order to repeat this high-energy experience, they may gradually develop a preference for team battles. We speculate that it is very likely that the fun experience of this type of gameplay is more difficult to experience and verify in life than the fun of plots, dressing up, and puzzle solving, which are relatively easy to feel and judge whether you like them in real life.</p>

<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Territory War is a form of large-scale team battle in MMORPG. Compared with regular team battles such as leagues, large-scale team battles such as Territory War have richer map mechanisms and dispatch mechanisms, bringing additional tactical space to the gameplay. It is this relatively rich tactical space that gives players differentiated fun content:</p>
<p>① The high degree of freedom in strategic experience allows players to deeply understand the “pleasure of fighting with people.”</p>
<p>② The close cooperation of each participant in the gameplay to complete a goal allows players to have a stronger sense of belonging and gives rise to a sense of collective honor.</p>

    <title>What Exactly Do Players Mean by &quot;Grindy&quot;? – An Analysis of &quot;Grind&quot; from the Perspective of Time Perception</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220722/28584_1032534.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Grindy” is the most common complaint players have about games. Every player has a few memes in their phone complaining about how grindy a game is. Although players resonate so much with the topic of “grind”, what exactly do they mean by grind? Are they even talking about the same thing? Is grind simply referring to the length of time spent playing the game? Is it an objective time consumption or is it mixed with the influence of subjective perception? When developers receive feedback from players that “the game is too grindy”, they often fall into the dilemma of whether to modify the gameplay time. It seems that once players complain about grind, there are only two options: stick to it or shorten the time. This article will reveal the truth of “grind” from a psychological perspective.</p>
<h2 id="1-Who-is-Fluctuating-the-Player’s-Inner-Clock"><a href="#1-Who-is-Fluctuating-the-Player’s-Inner-Clock" class="headerlink" title="1. Who is Fluctuating the Player’s Inner Clock?"></a>1. Who is Fluctuating the Player’s Inner Clock?</h2><h3 id="Introduction-to-Time-Perception-and-Factors-Affecting-Time-Perception"><a href="#Introduction-to-Time-Perception-and-Factors-Affecting-Time-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Time Perception and Factors Affecting Time Perception"></a>Introduction to Time Perception and Factors Affecting Time Perception</h3><p>“Grind” (肝 - gān) refers to spending a lot of time and energy playing games, and it gets its name from the fact that staying up late is bad for the liver. There is also a rumor that a certain old brother stayed up late playing games and eventually developed liver cirrhosis, and his friends in the game joked that he should pay attention to his liver. Before analyzing the problem of “grind”, we must first understand how time is perceived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F11fae990-60bf-4975-b665-1a0e3d2722cd.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;11fae990-60bf-4975-b665-1a0e3d2722cd.jpg"></p>
<p>Time perception refers to our cognition of the duration and sequence of objective things and events. Unlike sight, hearing, touch and other senses, humans do not have specific organs to perceive time, and time perception is not a function of a single sensory channel. In other words, time perception is actually a subjective perception of people, a process of integrating fragments of the surrounding environment in an “appropriate way”.</p>
<p>Psychological theory believes that people judge the length of time based on two factors: external and internal. External factors include the rising and setting of the sun, the alternation of day and night, and timing tools; internal factors are the physiological and psychological activities of the human body, and the regular activities of the body can also be used as a basis for people to perceive time, such as the biological clock.</p>
<p>But the clock in people’s hearts is often not consistent with the real time, that is, a time illusion occurs. To give a simple example, with the same two hours, when you play a game you like, you will feel that time flies by, and you may even miss dinner; but if you watch a bad movie, you will feel that every minute is like sitting on pins and needles.</p>
<p>So what factors affect time perception?</p>
<p>Studies have shown that emotions, attention, personal interests and life experiences, and the amount of event content all affect time perception. In general, ① when people are in a relaxed and happy mood, they will estimate the time to be shorter, but when they are in a state of anxiety, anger, and pain, they will estimate the time to be longer; ② when people face things they are interested in, they will feel that time passes quickly, and when they face things they are not interested in, they will feel that time passes slowly; ③ when people are fully engaged in something, they will forget the passage of time, but if attention is focused on time information, you will feel like a day is like a year; ④ within a certain period of time, the more and richer the number of things that happen, the more complex the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be shorter; and when facing fewer things and the simpler the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be longer. In addition, vision is more susceptible to external influences than hearing, etc., and is less accurate in judging time.</p>
<h2 id="2-Common-Misconceptions-about-“Grind”"><a href="#2-Common-Misconceptions-about-“Grind”" class="headerlink" title="2. Common Misconceptions about “Grind”"></a>2. Common Misconceptions about “Grind”</h2><h3 id="Grindy-games-do-not-equal-games-that-take-a-long-time"><a href="#Grindy-games-do-not-equal-games-that-take-a-long-time" class="headerlink" title="Grindy games do not equal games that take a long time"></a>Grindy games do not equal games that take a long time</h3><p>Back to the question of grind, we already know that time perception is not equal to actual physical time, and “grind” is a kind of subjective time perception of players, so when players say “the game is grindy”, it does not necessarily mean that the game actually takes a long time, but “I think” it takes a long time.</p>
<p>However, in the actual game development process, developers tend to equate grind with long time consumption. It seems that shortening the length of the gameplay can alleviate players’ complaints, but this is actually a mistake of “treating the symptoms but not the root cause”. For example, a certain MMORPG has been operating for many years, and its daily guaranteed tasks have always been criticized by players as being too time-consuming. At this time, how should the game user researcher conduct follow-up research? The conventional idea is that we will find players and break down which part of which gameplay players think is time-consuming, what kind of optimization players want, and what is the maximum length of time they can accept. But this plan actually ignores one point - in the past few years of the game’s operation, the daily time has not become longer, and may even have become shorter, so even if the gameplay is further shortened, the negative feedback cannot be solved from the root. The background of players’ complaints about long time consumption is that they have been playing this gameplay repeatedly for several years, and they no longer need any thinking or operation. The real problem of long time consumption does not point to time, but to the above-mentioned “simple stimulus events, decreased interest, and attention focused on time information”.</p>

Analysis of several types of grind"></a>How should we understand it? Analysis of several types of grind</h3><p>Precisely because time perception is affected by a variety of factors, different players’ feedback on “grind” often has different reasons, so the “grind” that everyone complains about may not be the same thing at all! Players often express “grind” in these forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been running back and forth, can’t there be a means of transportation? I feel like I’m wasting my time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are twenty daily tasks, and some of them are only open for a limited time. I have to keep watch at a fixed time. It’s too time-consuming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Each round I have to fight five waves of the same mobs, it’s very boring. After finishing one wave, I have to wait for the next wave. Can this task be canceled?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are many weapons that haven’t been collected yet, and hidden side quests that haven’t been unlocked. These really take time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This game is so grindy, I keep saying ‘one more turn and then I’ll go to sleep’, and then the sun comes up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>……</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F60854268-e782-40c5-93a6-1633c7fe0b81.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;60854268-e782-40c5-93a6-1633c7fe0b81.jpg"></p>
<p>Some of these feedbacks need to be brought to the attention of developers, while others may not constitute a serious problem.</p>
<p>(1) The first kind of feedback points to the problem of repeating an operation, which is then perceived as a meaningless waste of time. This is the “grind” that players most often criticize. Studies have shown that repetition can improve people’s fluency in processing information, but when it reaches extremely fluency, people will start to get bored. The negative emotions of boredom will further stretch people’s perceived length of time. Therefore, even if the time is actually shortened due to increased proficiency, people will feel that it takes longer. Interestingly, a large number of repetitions in a short period of time will cause boredom and fatigue, but long-term repetition will not. This may explain why weekly dungeons are not often criticized by players, but repeating 30 daily loops at a time is strongly rejected by some people.</p>
<p>(2) It is worth noting in the second feedback that if the rules, output, or progress of the task are uncertain, and players cannot predict or control the time consumption, it is easy to feel grindy in the waiting. For example, in game matching, if only the matching is prompted, but there is no specific upper limit of the matching time, players are more likely to perceive the matching time as long. In the newly launched gameplay, if there is no clear explanation of each stage and progress of the gameplay, players are also more likely to feel that they have nothing to do, and then quit the gameplay midway.</p>
<p>(3) In the third feedback, “very boring” indicates that the gameplay content may not have aroused the player’s interest. When players face gameplay that they are not interested in but have to do for rewards, they are more likely to feel that the task takes a long time. When not interested, players’ attention to the task is also easily focused on time information, that is, how long the task will take and how long it will take me to complete it, rather than on the task itself, which will further lengthen the player’s time perception.</p>
<p>“Each round I have to fight five waves of the same mobs” suggests that the task itself is relatively simple, and the operational difficulty for players is also low. When facing a small number of simple things, people will also estimate the time to be longer, which creates the illusion of “too grindy”.</p>
<p>Finally, “after finishing one wave, I have to wait for the next wave” implies that players may lack other interactive content during the waiting period, and are therefore more likely to focus on the waiting time.</p>
<p>(4) For the fourth and fifth feedbacks, although players also feedback grind, it is more of a grind that players actively choose, which does not necessarily represent negative feedback. For example, sandbox games and simulation management games are also often said to be “grindy” by players, but players often choose to grind with a certain purpose, which can be said to be concentrating on grinding; some outstanding games can also attract players to start a second playthrough, or fight the same boss hundreds or thousands of times. Therefore, even repetitive content can avoid the problem of “grind” if it can give players a slightly different experience each time or guide players to establish different goals at different stages.</p>

How to Alleviate Players’ Time Illusion</h2><h3 id="Some-psychological-inspirations"><a href="#Some-psychological-inspirations" class="headerlink" title="Some psychological inspirations"></a>Some psychological inspirations</h3><p>Regardless of the real grind caused by game design problems, how can we alleviate the grind caused by time illusion?</p>
<p>Players’ time perception is affected by both individual factors and environmental factors. Individual factors such as emotions and interests are not easy to control in actual development, and the specific situation varies, but in terms of environmental factors, we can still get some inspiration from psychology.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t let players wait foolishly. Appropriate distraction will be better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as waiting for someone is a torment, waiting for game loading is also a torment. Providing some engaging TV programs, newspapers and other content during the waiting process can distract people from the waiting time, thereby reducing their perceived waiting time. Similarly, filling the loading, matching and other waiting interfaces of the game with some interesting content can also achieve the same effect. It should be noted that studies have shown that different fillers have different effects on the perception of waiting time. If the filler cannot attract people, it will not only fail to reduce their perceived waiting time, but will also have the opposite effect.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Strengthen prompts and feedback on the status to reduce uncertainty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, it is to give clear feedback on all status information, including waiting time, so that players can clearly know what processes are still to come and the estimated time of each process. Life experience tells us that waiting before the agreed time will not make us emotionally volatile, but every minute of being late makes people irritable. Psychologists have proposed that people feel that the uncertain waiting time is longer than the definite waiting time. If they know nothing about the relevant information of the waiting time, they will perceive the time to be longer than the actual time, and vice versa.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Consider enriching the player’s psychological experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, within a certain period of time, the more and richer the number of things that happen, the more complex the nature, people tend to estimate the time to be shorter, which suggests that we need to provide players with more and richer game content. But it should be noted that these contents need to be able to enrich the player’s psychological experience rather than increase the player’s cognitive burden, that is to say, a complicated interface cannot achieve the same effect. Too much and complicated interface information may cause confusion to players, making them feel that it takes longer by reducing their sense of control; it may also directly trigger players’ negative emotions, thinking that the product looks very “grindy”.</p>

    <title>Behind the Highly-Rated Games with Widespread Negative Reviews - Why Can&#39;t Game Reviews Satisfy Players?</title>
    <url>/2021/12/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20220722_28584_1032538/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220722/28584_1032538.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s, early game media appeared in the players’ field of vision in the form of newspapers and magazines. At that time, game players had a single source of information and did not have a good opportunity to voice their opinions. Game media reviews of games largely influenced players’ game choices. With the rise of the Internet and modern social platforms, players have more information channels and can freely express their opinions on the Internet or game platforms. As a result, more and more players find that those highly-rated games often fail to bring them a good gaming experience. Where is the problem with the loss of “discourse power” in media reviews?</p>
<h2 id="1-Starting-with-the-Failure-of-Deathloop"><a href="#1-Starting-with-the-Failure-of-Deathloop" class="headerlink" title="1. Starting with the Failure of Deathloop"></a>1. Starting with the Failure of <em>Deathloop</em></h2><p>On Black Friday 2021, <em>Deathloop</em>, which had just been released for two months, started its 50% discount, ruthlessly backstabbing the pre-order players who mocked themselves as “stupid and rich”.</p>
<p>For game manufacturers, it is not a good thing to start a large discount too early. Because it not only hurts the hearts of those pre-order players (they are often the core fans of the game), but also reveals a dangerous signal: game sales may have begun to weaken, and the number of active players is at stake.</p>
<p><em>Deathloop</em>‘s current state is pretty much like this.</p>
<p>When the media review embargo was lifted on September 13, <em>Deathloop</em> was in the limelight. Metacritic media score was 88, and two major media outlets, IGN and GameSpot, gave full marks. Many media outlets were full of praise. However, after the game was officially released, many players found that the game was not as good as the media described. Frequent game crashes, endless annoying bugs, poor PC optimization, and an anti-cheat mechanism that was almost non-existent made the game’s advantages in level design and art style disappear - after all, if the game cannot even be entered, who cares how amazing your level design is?</p>
<p>Angry players expressed their dissatisfaction with the game with ratings and sales: Metacritic player score 4.8, mostly positive on Steam, forming a sharp contrast with previous media reviews. The game only briefly topped the Steam weekly sales chart based on initial media reviews, and then quickly “faded into obscurity”. The number of daily active players also dropped from the initial 20,000+ to less than 2,000 now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2F3961afc8-b30d-403d-87e5-56f989447b5a.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;3961afc8-b30d-403d-87e5-56f989447b5a.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>As of December 1, Deathloop’s Metacritic media score was 86, and the player score was 4.8</em></p>

<h2 id="2-Where-is-the-Disagreement"><a href="#2-Where-is-the-Disagreement" class="headerlink" title="2. Where is the Disagreement?"></a>2. Where is the Disagreement?</h2><p>The problems encountered by <em>Deathloop</em> are not an isolated phenomenon. The divergence between media reviews and player experience has long been evident. However, in previous years, most of the hardest-hit areas were concentrated in some annual games, such as <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA2K</em>. What really detonated the confrontation between players and the media was a tragedy caused by a golf club. Since then, the crisis of confidence between media ratings and player experience has intensified. “Trust the media for low scores, trust yourself for high scores”, “IGN, even dogs don’t watch it”, “Famitsu? Paid-tsu!”, more and more players use such simple and crude sentences to directly express their dissatisfaction with media reviews.</p>
<p>The loss of credibility of game media is ultimately due to the inherent limitations of its evaluation mechanism. Long-term operation of the game, performance problems, and paid in-app purchases are often the points of divergence between media reviews and player experience.</p>
<h3 id="Long-term-Operation-“Five-Years-of-Sharpening-a-Sword”"><a href="#Long-term-Operation-“Five-Years-of-Sharpening-a-Sword”" class="headerlink" title="Long-term Operation: “Five Years of Sharpening a Sword”"></a>Long-term Operation: “Five Years of Sharpening a Sword”</h3><p>Media evaluates the basic quality of the game at the time of release, that is, the short-term experience, while the player’s evaluation runs through the entire life cycle, that is, it also includes the long-term operating experience.</p>
<p>Most of the current game ratings are based on the media review version submitted一段时间 before the game is released. However, players’ experience of the game will run through the entire life cycle of the game, especially for some long-term online games. Therefore, the later operation of the game is also an important part of the player’s game experience.</p>
<p>There are not a few games that have good basic qualities but are dragged down by subsequent operations, such as <em>Battlefield 5</em> (meta score 81, player score 2.9), which has stopped updating. Of course, there are also games that have made a beautiful comeback with the subsequent operation of the game. The most well-known to players should be <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, which was full of negative reviews when it was just released, with an MC score of only 61. Highly repetitive gameplay, incomplete game completion, and deceptive marketing made this game fall to the bottom in terms of both player reviews and media reviews when it was just released. However, after five years of consistent free updates, the problems that the developer promised to solve have been solved as scheduled. Looking back at <em>No Man’s Sky</em> now, it may be difficult to imagine that this now “overwhelmingly positive” game was once mockingly called “No Man’s Hole” by domestic players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Ffcfe9621-3cb2-412e-9915-480fa84ed293.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;fcfe9621-3cb2-412e-9915-480fa84ed293.png"></p>

<p><em>《No Man’s Sky》 From Mostly Negative reviews in the early days to Overwhelmingly Positive reviews now</em></p>

<h3 id="Performance-Issues-2077-Bugs"><a href="#Performance-Issues-2077-Bugs" class="headerlink" title="Performance Issues: 2077 Bugs"></a>Performance Issues: 2077 Bugs</h3><p>When <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was just released in 2020, at least half of the negative reviews of the game were focused on the game’s bugs and optimization problems. And <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also “kindly” called “Cyberbug 2077” by players because of the numerous bugs. If the PC version only had a lot of bugs, then the console version was not like a finished game at all. A large number of frame drops, crashes, and texture problems caused a large number of players to request refunds just one week after the game was released, and it was even directly removed from the PS store. However, interestingly, such frequent and serious bugs did not significantly affect the media’s evaluation of 2077. When 2077’s media score was first lifted, it once won a high score of MC91.</p>
<p>Perhaps for game media, the occurrence of game bugs is understandable, but for players, a smooth game flow is obviously an important part of their game experience.</p>
<p>The media may not want to ignore the deeper design concept and subsequent development potential of the game because of game bugs. But as with the same problems encountered by <em>Deathloop</em>, no one likes to have 2077 bugs in their game, nor do they like to play a crash loop. The huge impact of these problems on the player’s game experience cannot be saved by excellent game design.</p>
<h3 id="Buy-to-Play-In-App-Purchases-“Pay-to-Win”"><a href="#Buy-to-Play-In-App-Purchases-“Pay-to-Win”" class="headerlink" title="Buy-to-Play In-App Purchases: “Pay to Win”?"></a>Buy-to-Play In-App Purchases: “Pay to Win”?</h3><p>The media’s tolerance for buy-to-play in-app purchases is often higher than that of players.</p>
<p><em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</em>, published by Warner, was obviously not significantly affected by the microtransaction system in the game in terms of media ratings. However, this work, which scored 90 points on IGN and an average MC score of 75 points (the MC score was once above 85 points when it was just released), still aroused the anger of players (MC player score 4.2) due to its microtransaction system, forcing the game to remove the in-app purchase system a few months later.</p>
<p>The buy-to-play + in-app purchase payment model is not uncommon in recent years. <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are all such payment models. For the media, the bottom line of in-app purchases is often that they do not seriously affect the game balance. Adding some in-app purchase elements to a single-player buy-to-play game cannot be an important factor in giving the game a low score. At most, a few points will be deducted to discourage this form. But for players, just not affecting the game balance cannot be a death-free gold medal for buy-to-play in-app purchases. Any in-app purchases that “pay to win” and increase the game’s grind to force purchases are likely to arouse players’ anger. Therefore, even for games like <em>Middle-earth</em>, which are biased towards single-player, it is difficult for players to accept paying to quickly improve their strength, let alone those games that focus on online play and can be “pay to win” to some extent (such as <em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220722%2Fa1e5d6d0-c3e3-4bdb-abc9-7305bbf952d7.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220722&#x2F;a1e5d6d0-c3e3-4bdb-abc9-7305bbf952d7.png"></p>

<h2 id="3-Lessons-from-Others"><a href="#3-Lessons-from-Others" class="headerlink" title="3. Lessons from Others"></a>3. Lessons from Others</h2><p>Game media is not unaware of this problem. For example, IGN will re-modify the previous evaluation after a major game update. However, if you want to truly fit the player’s game experience, future game media may need to be more “UX” oriented: listen to more feedback from test players, rather than relying solely on a few senior editors; give higher evaluation weight to player experience-oriented content, rather than just mentioning it briefly; adopt long-term tracking-style scoring research, rather than “stopping at the point” when it is released. Then perhaps the crisis of confidence between players and the media is not an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>For User Research, the following points need to be achieved:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>While paying attention to the basic quality of the game, attach importance to the long-term operation of the game;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider how to help the game establish a more agile and systematic performance problem early warning mechanism;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explore payment methods that players can accept.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is also a lesson from the crisis of confidence between media and players.</p>

    <title>Secrets Hidden Beyond Words: Non-Textual Information Guidance Design in Puzzle Games</title>
    <url>/2022/07/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20220801_28584_1034498/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220801/28584_1034498.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-About-Puzzle-Games-and-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance"><a href="#1-About-Puzzle-Games-and-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="1. About Puzzle Games and Non-Textual Information Guidance"></a>1. About Puzzle Games and Non-Textual Information Guidance</h2><p>More than ten years ago, on a summer afternoon, in an era when smartphones were not yet popular, when I opened the 4399 webpage, ready to switch games with a large piece of watermelon, a game called the <em>Baby Escape</em> series came into my sight. I didn’t know that it would open the door to puzzle games.</p>
<p>After that, there were countless masterpieces under the label of “puzzle”, such as the <em>Rusty Lake</em> series with wonderful plots and hardcore puzzle elements, or <em>Gris</em> with a romantic and ethereal artistic atmosphere, or <em>Her Story</em> with novel and interesting interactive ideas. But whenever I mention puzzle games, I still can’t forget the small game I played on the webpage many years ago. In one brain hole after another, I played as a baby chasing food, going to heaven and earth, and finally came to a strange planet and became friends with a robot who loves nature. The charm of puzzle games is nothing more than this: set out with a goal, feel satisfied in solving one obstacle after another, and finally understand the meaning of this world and reach the end of the plot.</p>
<h3 id="Elements-of-Puzzle-Games"><a href="#Elements-of-Puzzle-Games" class="headerlink" title="Elements of Puzzle Games"></a>Elements of Puzzle Games</h3><p>Although the definition of puzzle games is very broad, so broad that many game producers believe that as long as some puzzle-solving gameplay is forcibly inserted into the game, a “puzzle” tag can be added after the work tag, and players who prefer puzzle games will be included in the user portrait range. However, this is not the case. Although puzzle-solving is a classic and versatile seasoning in games, it is mostly a side dish to exquisite meals, bringing higher playability to the game, but it also has its own unique design points.</p>
<p>From the perspective of experience design, we can disassemble the elements of a puzzle game as follows.</p>
<p>First is the purpose of the puzzle, that is, the task set by the puzzle for the player, and the player’s motivation to complete the puzzle. For example, in the first part of the <em>Baby Escape</em> series, the player plays a baby who enters a variety of scenes because he is chasing a squirrel that has snatched snacks. At this time, the player’s motivation or ultimate goal to complete the puzzle is to catch up with the squirrel and get the snacks back, and the task set by the puzzle at hand is to escape the current scene. In classic puzzle games with the theme of escape rooms, even without too much plot development, escaping from a closed room is a natural task and motivation, and this setting gives the puzzle solving a natural necessity. But to make a deep impression on players and make the game full of charm, it is necessary to form the player’s internal driving force with the worldview and storyline.</p>
<p>Then there are the metaphors contained in the puzzle itself and the shaping of the worldview.</p>
<p>The game form brings a new sense of immersion and multi-sensory experience, which complements the nature of the puzzle itself as a carrier of stories and metaphors, and together constitutes the charm of puzzle games. In the third part of <em>Baby Escape</em>, the baby comes to outer space in order to retrieve snacks, and accidentally discovers a robot planet enslaved by the Slime King. When solving puzzles in the robot’s spaceship, you can find that there are green plants and insect drawings on the portholes of the spaceship, which shows that the robots yearn for a life full of vitality and attach great importance to the ecology and environment. But when players come to the planet where the robots live, they find that it is desolate and silent. Perhaps their former home was as green as the earth, but it became desolate and dilapidated after being plundered and mined by the Slime King.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the player’s puzzle-solving process, which is where interaction designers and game designers shine. How to let players of different intelligence and different game experience maximize their thinking potential in the whole puzzle-solving process without getting stuck is also what designers need to do through the ingenuity of interaction design. The process of player puzzle solving can be summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-and-Unconscious-Design"><a href="#Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-and-Unconscious-Design" class="headerlink" title="Non-Textual Information Guidance and Unconscious Design"></a>Non-Textual Information Guidance and Unconscious Design</h3><p>When designers expect players to perform corresponding operations in the game, they often need appropriate guidance. The essence of puzzle games is “solving problems with unknown answers through known elements in the game”. This process requires players to understand the basic mechanism of the game, collect and process necessary information, and finally solve the corresponding puzzles. For a specific puzzle-solving path, different guidance methods bring completely different sense of achievement and immersion to players.</p>
<p>Although textual information guidance is clear and definite, when it appears in large quantities, the gameplay and immersion experience will inevitably be destroyed, and it may even give players a feeling of “you are teaching me to play games”. Non-textual information can often be well hidden in the game environment, integrated with the background setting, and allow players to naturally perform interactive behaviors. The essence of non-textual information guidance is similar to the “unconscious design” proposed by designer Naoto Fukasawa. He believes that design should pay attention to these unconscious behaviors and transform them into visible things, which can make the design more suitable for human behavior and can be operated intuitively.</p>
<h2 id="2-Design-Points-of-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-in-Various-Elements"><a href="#2-Design-Points-of-Non-Textual-Information-Guidance-in-Various-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Design Points of Non-Textual Information Guidance in Various Elements"></a>2. Design Points of Non-Textual Information Guidance in Various Elements</h2><h3 id="Puzzle-Purpose-Design-of-Big-Goals-and-Small-Goals"><a href="#Puzzle-Purpose-Design-of-Big-Goals-and-Small-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle Purpose: Design of Big Goals and Small Goals"></a>Puzzle Purpose: Design of Big Goals and Small Goals</h3><p>Here, the big goal refers to what the puzzle is ultimately for, which is related to whether the player has sufficient motivation to complete the entire puzzle-solving process, and can keep track of their puzzle-solving progress at any time. For puzzle games with long-term processes, it is very important to let players perceive their game progress at any time, which is conducive to reducing the player’s psychology of giving up halfway in the game.</p>
<p>In the game <em>Gris</em>, at the beginning of the first playthrough, the statue collapses, the world loses its color and becomes gray, and Gris also loses the ability to sing. During the whole puzzle-solving adventure, the player gradually restores the world to life through continuous exploration. As the watercolor spreads between the sky and the plaster statue, the player’s heart is also filled with color. The game uses the acquisition of color to reflect the division between large levels and to hint at the progress towards the ending. While being shocked, players are also deeply attracted and driven by the change of color rhythm of this scene art.</p>
<p>The small goal refers to the task set by the puzzle in the current scene. Players in puzzle games often have questions such as “Who am I”, “Where am I”, and “What should I do”. Whether the goal can be clearly presented to the player largely determines the player’s game experience. When the puzzle lacks the guidance of the presentation of a small goal, players are likely to feel confused and get stuck.</p>
<p>There are many large-scale puzzles in <em>Gris</em>. When the overall presentation of the puzzle exceeds the screen limit, with the forced zooming out of the camera, the player can see the whole picture of the entire puzzle at the first time, so as to form an estimation and thinking about the puzzle-solving purpose and puzzle-solving path of the entire scene in their minds.</p>
<h3 id="The-Puzzle-Itself-High-Quality-Metaphor-of-Core-Gameplay"><a href="#The-Puzzle-Itself-High-Quality-Metaphor-of-Core-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="The Puzzle Itself: High-Quality Metaphor of Core Gameplay"></a>The Puzzle Itself: High-Quality Metaphor of Core Gameplay</h3><p>The puzzle of <em>Gorogoa</em> is mainly based on graphic interaction, and there are almost no readable words in the game. The Chinese translation of this game is “Picture World”, which tells the story of a little boy who discovers a beautiful and huge mysterious creature outside the window, and thus embarks on a journey to find this mysterious creature. The strongest experience that this game brings to players is different from the traditional puzzle-solving gameplay, but focuses on the interaction of picture frames and the dual meaning of the same picture, which also constitutes the basis of the game’s core gameplay and content performance.</p>
<p>The producer, Jason Roberts, felt the narrative tension of a single picture from the book “Fourteen Strange Pictures and Fourteen Stories”, and realized from the illustrations that multi-picture narratives can constitute a richer game world. So he set the core gameplay as the interaction of picture frames and the narrative presentation of multiple pictures.</p>
<p>Picture frames and multiple pictures carry very important meanings in the game.</p>
<p>When players first get started with this game, they will naturally superimpose, split, or splice picture frames. Each operation can bring unexpected surprises. The splicing of multiple pictures will naturally make players want to piece together different stories by adjusting their order, and the mystery brought by the picture frame will make players imagine things outside the picture frame and desire to escape from the picture frame. The dual meaning of objects, as the basis for the splicing of picture frames, fully embodies the key to “fantasy mysticism” and mobilizes players’ desire for knowledge from small objects to the big world. Under the design of this high-quality metaphor, all puzzles no longer seem to be deliberately designed by the designer, as if they are an organic part of that world.</p>
<h3 id="Puzzle-Solving-Process-How-to-Let-Players-Solve-Puzzles-Naturally"><a href="#Puzzle-Solving-Process-How-to-Let-Players-Solve-Puzzles-Naturally" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle-Solving Process: How to Let Players Solve Puzzles Naturally"></a>Puzzle-Solving Process: How to Let Players Solve Puzzles Naturally</h3><p>(1) Establishment of Common Sense and Rules</p>
<p>For puzzle games, the mechanism and methods of exploring the world and puzzles can be roughly divided into two types: special puzzle-solving rules and general puzzle-solving rules. For the former, they are generally special interaction methods designed by designers based on the story background of the game. For example, in the game <em>Carto</em>, the core of puzzle-solving throughout is the map mechanism similar to a jigsaw puzzle: the explorable area is a map block, and players can splice and rotate them at will, as long as the edges can be aligned. When a specific map combination is spelled out through plot hints, new maps or new plot characters will appear.</p>
<p>How to naturally establish the game’s puzzle-solving common sense and rules in the player’s mind is a very important part of experience design. In the opening plot animation of the game, the grandmother shows Carto how she manipulates the map to affect the actual terrain changes. While the grandmother is asleep, Carto accidentally puts the map blocks of clouds and the airship together. At this time, the wind surges, Carto is blown off the airship, and thus separates from her grandmother and begins her puzzle-solving adventure story. This plot not only explains the cause and effect of the adventure, the player’s motivation and purpose of solving puzzles (exploring the world and finding the grandmother), but also cleverly paves the way for the “rules” of this world: the map can be dragged and rotated, spliced with each other, and affect the real world.</p>
<p>(2) Player Inertia Guidance</p>
<p>For those general puzzle-solving methods in puzzle games, the learning cost of players can be reduced by adopting the rules in reality or the mental model of similar games. Just like being a frequent visitor to puzzle games, we know that those loose stones will definitely have hidden paths after being stepped on and broken, and as people who live in the three-dimensional world every day, we also know that we can jump to another platform with the help of the inertia of the rope swing. The rules of reality and the established gameplay of the game improve the rationality and predictability of the puzzles, so that the game will not have too strong a sense of fragmentation.</p>
<p>In the hospital level of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>, there is a very clever design that fits the background of the hospital: players enter a strange room, and from the X-ray film posted on the wall, they can know that they have come to a place similar to a hospital radiology department, and the key they need to find may be in the doll’s belly. Players need to drag the dolls one by one behind the X-ray machine, press the button, take X-rays for the dolls, and then take the doll with the key to the incinerator upstairs, burn the doll, and take out the key.</p>
<p>For players who understand the real-life rules of these items, the whole process can be easily understood without intentional guidance. For the designer, the introduction of new puzzle-solving gameplay does not increase the player’s learning cost, nor does it require too much additional guidance design, and it is cleverly combined with the story background, which is really the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>(3) Trial and Error and Misdirection</p>
<p>The guidance of puzzle games is not all positive. Interesting misdirection will sometimes make players look back at the details, explore unexpected puzzle-solving paths, and then slap their heads: “So that’s how it’s solved!”</p>
<p>The overall guidance design of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em> is very smooth. There are many scratches visible everywhere in the game, some are used to imply the trajectory of item movement, and some are used to prompt traps falling from the sky. Most players cannot react quickly when they encounter a trap for the first time, but after trial and error, players will find that the table in front of them has obvious scratches from the trap, and when players see similar scratches again, they will be more vigilant.</p>
<p>In the library area of the school level of <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>, the chase battle with the teacher also cleverly uses the design of misdirection. When the player plays for the first time, he will pass through the library and try to go out from the side door. However, since the companion is captured at this time, the door that needs two people to push open cannot be pushed at this time. The game uses common sense to guide players to the seemingly openable door, but when the player is stuck at the door and can only let the long-necked teacher approach little by little, this inescapable horror fills the whole body, and I believe that no player will forget this death.</p>
<p>When the player plays for the second time, they will realize that they need to hide beside the door first, wait for the teacher to go out, and then drag the box with the help of the scratches on the floor, climb up and push open the door handle. The designer designed the misdirection point not to “punish the player”, but to make those players who do not carefully observe the scene make mistakes, so as to learn lessons and strengthen their cognition of common sense in the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Epilogue"><a href="#3-Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="3. Epilogue"></a>3. Epilogue</h2><p>Puzzle games are an interactive art. It needs to have natural interactive logic, a good emotional experience, and a pleasing aesthetic feeling. These three influence and achieve each other. When they are harmoniously unified, we can say that the design of this puzzle game is excellent. <em>Gorogoa</em>‘s author Roberts once asked himself: “What attracts me to puzzle games? I think it has something to do with the hidden structure or meaning of the world. The seemingly ordinary things in the world, if you can arrange and combine them in the right way, you can find some hidden structures. If you look at the world and don’t find any meaning, it means that you have to accept some challenges to find meaning.” And interaction designers are the people who secretly guide players to discover challenges, complete challenges, and finally piece together the secrets and meanings of the world.</p>

    <title>From 20 to 380? How to Do Cross-Analysis in Game User Research?</title>
    <url>/2022/07/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20220801_28584_1034518/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220801/28584_1034518.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questionnaire surveys are a commonly used research method in game user research, which can quickly collect data from a large sample. Although how to set up questions and how many questions to set in a questionnaire are determined by the research purpose, in general, questionnaire designers will control the number of questions to about twenty, and no more than thirty.</p>
<p>So, can a questionnaire with twenty items only provide twenty pieces of information? Of course not! Cross-analysis can allow a limited questionnaire to provide more information and play a greater role. From a purely mathematical point of view, two-by-two crossing of twenty questions can produce 380 results. How to use so many crosses? How to use meaningful cross-analysis in game user research to deeply understand players?</p>
<p>This article will briefly introduce what cross-analysis is and its application significance, and show how to do cross-analysis in game user research.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Cross-Analysis"><a href="#1-What-is-Cross-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Cross-Analysis?"></a>1. What is Cross-Analysis?</h2><p>Cross-analysis is a basic data analysis method used to analyze the relationship between two variables. This analysis method crosses two or more indicators to find the relationship between variables and discover more data characteristics.</p>
<p>The following uses an example to briefly explain what cross-analysis is.</p>
<p>There are two questions in the in-game questionnaire of a certain game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>① Based on your recent game experience, what is your satisfaction with the game?<br>a. Very dissatisfied<br>b. Relatively dissatisfied<br>c. Neutral<br>d. Relatively satisfied<br>e. Very satisfied</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>② What is your gender?<br>a. Male<br>b. Female</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A total of 200 questionnaires were collected, and the results of data statistics for each question are as follows (non-real data, not statistically significant):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Question</th>
<th align="left">Option 1</th>
<th align="left">Option 2</th>
<th align="left">Option 3</th>

<td align="left">Very Dissat.</td>

<td align="left">Very Satisfied</td>
<td align="left"></td>

<td align="left">200</td>

</tbody></table>
<p>At this time, the results we can see from the data analysis are that the ratio of men to women in the game is close to 1:1, and the overall satisfaction is more than dissatisfaction. The cross-analysis result is obtained by crossing the two variables of gender and satisfaction, which is an analysis that combines these two variables.</p>

<h2 id="2-The-Significance-of-Cross-Analysis-from-the-Perspective-of-“Simpson’s-Paradox”"><a href="#2-The-Significance-of-Cross-Analysis-from-the-Perspective-of-“Simpson’s-Paradox”" class="headerlink" title="2. The Significance of Cross-Analysis from the Perspective of “Simpson’s Paradox”"></a>2. The Significance of Cross-Analysis from the Perspective of “Simpson’s Paradox”</h2><p>It is not difficult to find the significance of cross-analysis from the above case. The analysis of only single variables will lead to the conclusion that players are more satisfied than dissatisfied with the game, but after cross-analysis, it will be found that male players and female players have completely different evaluations of the game. Most male players are generally dissatisfied with the game, while the positive emotions of female players have pulled up the overall satisfaction level.</p>
<p>The significance of cross-analysis is that through this analysis method, it is possible to more clearly understand the views of different types of players&#x2F;users on the game&#x2F;product, and prevent the excessive integration of data from masking and losing real data.</p>
<p>The so-called masking and loss of real data can be more clearly perceived through “Simpson’s Paradox”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F72d9cc0b-6eb6-4ae5-9a87-7eb27a0be1eb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;72d9cc0b-6eb6-4ae5-9a87-7eb27a0be1eb.png"></p>
<p>We encountered “Simpson’s Paradox” when analyzing the payment rate of a certain game’s gameplay. (The following data is not real data) In this game, the payment rate of scenery-oriented players in the overall gameplay is much higher than that of appearance-oriented players, the former is 44%, and the latter is only 28%. Before concluding that “scenery-oriented players are more willing to pay in gameplay than appearance-oriented players”, we found that the payment rate of appearance-oriented players in the two gameplays that make up the game - gameplay A and gameplay B - is higher than that of scenery-oriented players.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left"></th>
<th align="left">Gameplay A</th>
<th align="left">Gameplay B</th>
<th align="left">Overall</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Scenery</td>
<td align="left">53%</td>
<td align="left">10%</td>
<td align="left">44%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Appearance</td>
<td align="left">80%</td>
<td align="left">15%</td>
<td align="left">28%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In gameplay A, the payment rate of appearance-oriented players is 80%, which is higher than that of scenery-oriented players, which is 53%; similarly, in gameplay B, the payment rate of appearance-oriented players, 15%, is higher than that of scenery-oriented players, 10%. However, in the overall gameplay payment of the game, the payment rate of scenery-oriented players is almost twice that of appearance-oriented players.</p>
<p>This is a typical “Simpson’s Paradox”, where the overall trend is completely opposite to the classified trend. Why does this happen? Because from the perspective of sub-gameplay, the payment rate of gameplay A is very high (58%) and the payment rate of gameplay B is very low (14%). In this case, a large number of scenery-oriented players participated in gameplay A, while a large number of appearance-oriented players participated in gameplay B. The overall trend that does not distinguish between gameplays loses the connotation of the data and pushes the overall explanation to the other extreme.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Do-Cross-Analysis-in-Game-User-Research"><a href="#3-How-to-Do-Cross-Analysis-in-Game-User-Research" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Do Cross-Analysis in Game User Research?"></a>3. How to Do Cross-Analysis in Game User Research?</h2><p>Theoretically, any two variables can be crossed, and a questionnaire can get hundreds of cross-relationships, but many cross-relationships have no practical significance. In the questionnaire analysis of game user research, if you want to conduct cross-analysis, the core is actually to classify players according to different standards, and then analyze the data of different types of players. Therefore, the core of cross-analysis in game user research is how to classify players.</p>
<p>Combining the characteristics of game players and data, this article divides the cross-analysis classification methods of game questionnaires into three categories.</p>
<h3 id="Cross-Analysis-Based-on-Demographics"><a href="#Cross-Analysis-Based-on-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="Cross-Analysis Based on Demographics"></a>Cross-Analysis Based on Demographics</h3><p>Classifying players based on demographics is the most common way. Demographic information includes gender, age, income, occupation, region, etc.</p>
<p>Most questionnaires will collect demographic questions at the end, and game research questionnaires are no exception. After collecting the questionnaire, conduct data analysis, gender ratio, age segment, but demographic information provides far more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F6a8da674-d7f7-4da6-819d-d023db967753.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;6a8da674-d7f7-4da6-819d-d023db967753.png"></p>
<p>How do we use demographic information for cross-analysis in games? Gender is the most widely used in game questionnaire cross-analysis. Male players and female players show different attitudes in the choice of game types, preferences for game art styles, and pursuit of game fun. For example, in a questionnaire analysis, after classifying players by gender, it can be seen that female players pay special attention to the picture style and the pace of the game, while male players pay more attention to the game theme and the investment of money and time (ie, the cost-effectiveness of the game).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F4a819fbc-df90-4c3a-9ef7-a58e24b407d4.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;4a819fbc-df90-4c3a-9ef7-a58e24b407d4.png"></p>
<p>When investigating the media channels that players are exposed to, through cross-analysis we found that girls prefer Weibo and Xiaohongshu, while boys relatively prefer live broadcast platforms. This discovery of media contact preference inspires us to what kind of materials our game marketing should produce and on which platforms to attract players (the data does not show all options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2Fb7bab50a-bbee-43fa-8392-8068bde4b9e6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;b7bab50a-bbee-43fa-8392-8068bde4b9e6.png"></p>
<p>Demographic factors such as players’ age and income are also often seen in the cross-analysis of game questionnaires, but factors such as region are not common. The reason is that factors such as region are largely related to the factor of income. Using these factors for classification may not reflect the differences caused by regional culture, but the overall economic level.</p>
<h3 id="Player-Classification-Questions-Designed-in-the-Questionnaire"><a href="#Player-Classification-Questions-Designed-in-the-Questionnaire" class="headerlink" title="Player Classification Questions Designed in the Questionnaire"></a>Player Classification Questions Designed in the Questionnaire</h3><p>In addition to the “fixed setting” demographic questions in the questionnaire, questionnaire designers can also add meaningful player classification questions when designing the questionnaire, which is convenient for cross-analysis after collecting data. We once asked players about their gaming experience in the questionnaire as a basis for distinguishing players. By comparing the channels through which MMO mobile game players and two-dimensional mobile game players receive new game information, it can be seen that MMO mobile game players receive more customer service or pushes from game companies (the data does not show all options).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F5e88e62f-0af5-4c68-8385-63dc57d24479.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;5e88e62f-0af5-4c68-8385-63dc57d24479.png"></p>
<p>In addition to the game experience background, we have also used multiple indicators such as player communication ability and player game level to classify players, and further analyze the attitudes of different types of players.</p>
<h3 id="Classify-Players-According-to-Their-In-Game-Data-After-Questionnaire-Collection"><a href="#Classify-Players-According-to-Their-In-Game-Data-After-Questionnaire-Collection" class="headerlink" title="Classify Players According to Their In-Game Data After Questionnaire Collection"></a>Classify Players According to Their In-Game Data After Questionnaire Collection</h3><p>The demographic information and pre-established player classification questions mentioned above are all based on the results of the questionnaire collection to classify players. In fact, we can also classify players according to their in-game level, school and other game-related data after the questionnaire is collected, to understand the situation of players of different levels&#x2F;schools filling out the questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="4-Common-Indicators-in-Cross-Analysis"><a href="#4-Common-Indicators-in-Cross-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="4. Common Indicators in Cross-Analysis"></a>4. Common Indicators in Cross-Analysis</h2><p>There are two common indicators in cross-analysis: row&#x2F;column percentage and TGI index.</p>
<h3 id="Row-Column-Percentage"><a href="#Row-Column-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="Row&#x2F;Column Percentage"></a>Row&#x2F;Column Percentage</h3><p>Still taking the cross-analysis of “gender × satisfaction” as an example:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th align="left"></th>

</tbody></table>
<p>Row percentage refers to the number of samples crossed by two variables &#x2F; the number of samples in the corresponding row, which reflects the difference in data on the column variable based on the row variable as the main variable (the difference in satisfaction between men and women in the example).</p>

<p>Column percentage refers to the number of samples crossed by two variables &#x2F; the number of samples in the corresponding column, which reflects the difference in data on the row variable based on the different column variables (the difference in gender of players with different satisfaction levels in the example).</p>
<table>

<p>When analyzing and calculating, choosing row percentage or column percentage mainly depends on whether the indicator has practical significance. In the crossing of some variables, both row&#x2F;column percentages have certain explanatory significance, but in the crossing of some variables, only one indicator is meaningful. As in the above case, the row percentage indicator reflects the difference in player satisfaction under gender differences, while the column percentage indicator has no practical significance.</p>
<h3 id="TGI-Index"><a href="#TGI-Index" class="headerlink" title="TGI Index"></a>TGI Index</h3><p>TGI stands for Target Group Index, which reflects the strength&#x2F;weakness of the target group within a specific range. TGI &#x3D; the proportion of the target group with a certain characteristic &#x2F; the proportion of the total population with the same characteristic * 100%.</p>
<p>When TGI &#x3D; 100%, it indicates that there is no difference between a certain characteristic group and the overall population;</p>
<p>When TGI &gt; 100%, it indicates that the group characteristics are stronger than the overall performance, and increase with the increase of the number;</p>
<p>When TGI &lt; 100%, it indicates that the group characteristics are weaker than the overall performance.</p>
<p>Taking the cross-analysis of “gender × media channel” as an example, the questionnaire asks players which platform they use more often, a short video platform or a live broadcast platform, and the results are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220801%2F5991ad12-babb-45aa-971a-2f6a2f621056.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220801&#x2F;5991ad12-babb-45aa-971a-2f6a2f621056.png"></p>
<p>At this time, whether from the overall perspective or from the perspective of gender, players use the short video platform more often. Is this all the information we can get? The TGI results provide another piece of information:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Gender</th>
<th align="left">Short Video Platform TGI</th>
<th align="left">Live Broadcast Platform TGI</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Male</td>
<td align="left">86%</td>
<td align="left">143%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Female</td>
<td align="left">113%</td>
<td align="left">62%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Take 86% as an example, it is obtained by dividing 60% of male players choosing the short video platform by 70% of overall players choosing the short video platform. The TGI index tells us that, relative to the overall population, male players use live broadcast platforms more often, and female players use short video platforms more often. The TGI index reflects the preference of a certain group relative to the overall population, which provides another piece of information.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>In fact, there are many scenarios where we can use cross-analysis in the analysis process. Many people know what cross-analysis is, but don’t know how to use it in specific scenarios, especially in game data analysis. Therefore, after briefly introducing cross-analysis, this article uses “Simpson’s Paradox” to intuitively demonstrate the significance of cross-analysis, and then summarizes the commonly used player classification methods for cross-analysis in game user research, and finally introduces the practical indicators of cross-analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to cross-analysis, there are many other ways to analyze questionnaires. In analyzing questionnaires, not only being limited to statistics of questionnaire question results can make the questionnaire play a greater role.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Recently, India’s population exceeded 1.415 billion, surpassing China’s census figure of 1.412 billion (2021 census), making it the most populous country in the world.</p>
<p>India’s total land area is about 2.97 million square kilometers, only 30% of China’s. It is quite remarkable how India has achieved great economic growth in recent years, supporting a population of over 1.4 billion on its land. Fortunately, India has vast arable land, which it has developed into a world-class agricultural power. With the gradually developing economic conditions, the Indian people’s demand for entertainment and culture is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>Economic development has led to the rapid spread of communications and mobile terminals in the country.  In the first quarter of 2021, smartphone shipments in India increased by 23% to reach 38 million units; the overall smartphone penetration rate was 36.7%, with a user base of at least 502 million people. Although high-end models have not yet become mainstream, the Indian smartphone market has witnessed tremendous development in the past 5-6 years, one manifestation of which is that the RAM of mobile phones has increased at least 5 times compared with before, making the overall operating speed much faster.</p>

<p>Thanks to the rapid development of the smartphone industry and the low-cost system of 4G networks and data plans, many mobile phone users naturally began to come into contact with mobile games and become mobile game players. This article will mainly analyze the rapidly developing Indian game market in recent years from three aspects: the overall market, game players, and industry trends.</p>
<h2 id="1-Overall-Market"><a href="#1-Overall-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Overall Market"></a>1. Overall Market</h2><h3 id="“Fast-Speed-Large-Space”"><a href="#“Fast-Speed-Large-Space”" class="headerlink" title="“Fast Speed, Large Space”"></a>“Fast Speed, Large Space”</h3><p>According to a report on the Indian investment industry released by BCG and Sequoia Capital, in 2019 and 2020, the total Indian game market experienced a compound annual growth rate of at least 37% and 39%, and maintained a very good upward momentum. Its growth rate exceeded most of India’s media and culture sub-sectors, such as social media, video, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2F386d4f05-46ae-49f3-8a5d-a58bc4651ac6.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;386d4f05-46ae-49f3-8a5d-a58bc4651ac6.png"></p>

<p>We know that China surpassed the United States in 2020 to become the world’s largest game market. China and the United States have also occupied more than 40% of the global game market for many years. In India, according to 2020 data, the total revenue of the country’s game market accounted for only about 1% of the global market, and there is still huge room for growth. Especially in mobile games, the revenue of the Indian mobile game market exceeded 1.5 billion US dollars in 2020. Combined with its compound annual growth rate of at least 30%, this number is expected to exceed 5 billion US dollars by 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2F5c00b5d1-f1d8-42ba-9c9e-b2e15dd6f866.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;5c00b5d1-f1d8-42ba-9c9e-b2e15dd6f866.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Comparison of Game Markets in China, the United States, and India</em></p>
<p>If we turn our attention to the perspective of game commercialization, we can find that the Indian mobile game market is still in a very preliminary stage of development. Take PUBG Mobile as an example. The game’s downloads in the Indian market account for more than 25% of the global data, but the total revenue only accounts for less than 5%.  It seems that the overall growth space is huge. Why? High downloads, increased smartphone penetration, and advancements in terminal device performance all indicate that there are many Indians who can play games and who will play games, but they are still in the initial stage in terms of commercialization. By conducting more in-depth analysis of the Indian player group and doing more localization in terms of gameplay and art design, I believe there will be more opportunities waiting to be discovered. One piece of data also shows a clue, that is, from 2017 to 2020, at least 5-6 new mobile games will break into the TOP20 of the revenue list every year, which also means that the entire mobile game revenue TOP list is undergoing changes every year, and new opportunities and innovative categories are constantly emerging.</p>
<h2 id="2-Player-Situation"><a href="#2-Player-Situation" class="headerlink" title="2. Player Situation"></a>2. Player Situation</h2><h3 id="“Many-Mobile-Game-Players-Complex-Types”"><a href="#“Many-Mobile-Game-Players-Complex-Types”" class="headerlink" title="“Many Mobile Game Players, Complex Types”"></a>“Many Mobile Game Players, Complex Types”</h3><p>As an emerging game market, the Indian game market has developed tremendously with the popularization of smartphones. However, this also brings a result, that is, in India, the revenue brought by the mobile game market may account for more than 90% of the entire Indian game market. This data is a very astonishing proportion compared to China and the United States. Even in China, where the PC game market is shrinking severely, the proportion of revenue from mobile games is 76%, and this data is even smaller in the US market.  According to a survey, 90% of Indian game players also said that they prefer mobile games and are not inclined to PC and console games. This is a relatively obvious characteristic of Indian game players.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the continuous increase of players in the Indian game market, and the market in the country has experienced a leap-forward development, this has brought a very significant feature to the entire game industry. In China, whether it is game players or game developers, they start with simple and easy-to-use games, or games with relatively simple system structures, and gradually transition to the development and experience of more difficult and complex games. There is a very obvious learning curve in this. For the Indian game market and players, this learning curve is extremely steep.  Since the rapid popularization of smartphones in the country in 2016, it has been accompanied by a large number of excellent and complex mobile games imported from abroad. Most players have been exposed to games with complex systems, diverse gameplay, and very high completion from the beginning.</p>
<p>Driven by the rapid development of the global mobile game industry in recent years, combined with the slower development speed of local Indian developers, the demand of game players in the country has gradually reached a point where it cannot be continuously met. More and more players are beginning to pursue more unique and novel games. This can also be seen from the fact that 5-6 games in the TOP20 revenue list change every year.</p>
<p>At the same time, more and more Indian players are gradually developing into players with strong social attributes. This part of the players accounts for about half of all players. They prefer to play games with their friends or family, and regard games as a way of socializing. This feature can also be seen relatively clearly among Chinese mobile game players. Especially when some team games become popular, the social attributes of these games become very powerful. The demand of the Indian game market and player groups is also developing in this direction.</p>
<p>Specifically, players in the Indian market can be divided into the following categories: Try-and-See, Immersed, Game Enjoyers, Social, Status Seekers, and Hedonistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220802%2Fbefc3aca-d2ca-494e-abae-c3e3acda746b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220802&#x2F;befc3aca-d2ca-494e-abae-c3e3acda746b.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Six Types of Players in the Indian Mobile Game Market</em></p>
<p>How to understand these player classifications in the Indian game market? Let’s take a look at the explanations:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Try-and-See:</strong> These players like to use games to pass the boring time, and at the same time are very unwilling to miss various updates. The game types they prefer include casual games, board games and other light games, and they also have the shortest weekly game time.<br>(2) <strong>Immersed:</strong> These Indian players prefer games such as adventure games and casual games. They usually enjoy and immerse themselves in personal alone time. If they can play games during this time, they will be relatively satisfied.<br>(3) <strong>Game Enjoyers:</strong> These players enjoy several of their favorite games very much. These games are often mainly medium-to-heavy games, but their game time will not be too long.<br>(4) <strong>Social:</strong> Obviously, the characteristics of these players are prominent, that is, they will regard games as a social channel or means, and achieve the purpose of interacting with friends by playing games. So they basically don’t play games alone, but team up with friends, whether friends are online or offline.<br>(5) <strong>Status Seekers:</strong> Because gambling games are allowed in India, these players are relatively special. They are keen to achieve the purpose of making money in the game.<br>(6) <strong>Hedonistic:</strong> Most of these players are heavy game lovers. They will invest a lot of time every week, and often team up with online friends to play.</p>

Some well-known European and American game manufacturers, including EA, Ubisoft, Zynga, etc., established branches in India in the early years, which also helped the Indian game development industry make significant progress to a certain extent. At the same time, many foreign game companies choose to publish games in India, which also indirectly promotes the prosperity of the Indian game development industry.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many investment companies or the strategic departments of game giants have already taken a fancy to the Indian game market and have carried out a large number of investment and financing businesses in the market in the past 2-3 years. Data shows that from August 2020 to January 2021, in less than half a year, investment from all over the world in the Indian game industry reached 544 million US dollars.</p>
<p>The above is some analysis of the current situation of the Indian game market. We will also continue to track and analyze emerging markets including India, Brazil, the Middle East and other regions.  Stay tuned!</p>

    <title>How do Japanese Text-Based Mystery Games Create an Immersive World of Deduction?</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220802/28584_1034788.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Many fans of mystery games are fascinated by the worlds of deduction created by Japanese text-based mystery games. This article mainly introduces how Japanese text-based mystery games use the element of “closed circle” to create a satisfying world of deduction for players.</p>
<p>Japanese mystery adventure games are a game genre with regional cultural characteristics. Although relatively niche, they have many excellent works. From doujin circles to large game companies, from <em>Kamaitachi no Yoru</em> to <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> and <em>The House in Fata Morgana</em>, Japanese text-based mystery games attract players from all over the world with their unique charm. Emphasizing atmosphere creation, character development, and a compelling storyline are the essence of Japanese text-based mystery adventure games. The key to adventure games lies in player engagement and experience. Pure text games often lack interactive elements, making it difficult for players to immerse themselves in the game. In order to give players an immersive gaming experience, Japanese text-based mystery games pay more attention to atmosphere creation to enhance the player’s sense of immersion and involvement. Therefore, this article will summarize a common technique used in Japanese text-based mystery games to create atmosphere and analyze how this type of text game uses the “closed circle” element to enable players to participate in the plot and successfully empathize.</p>
<h2 id="1-Background-Setting"><a href="#1-Background-Setting" class="headerlink" title="1. Background Setting"></a>1.

Because the story of <em>And Then There Were None</em> takes place on an isolated island, the “Closed Circle” setting is also known as the “isolated island” setting. This setting was re-created and reached its peak in Japan. Nowadays, many Japanese indie AVG games reflect the setting of “Closed Circle”. A “Closed Circle” is an isolated predicament caused by natural or man-made factors, in which all the characters are gathered in a relatively closed environment and cannot temporarily contact the outside world. In an environment where everyone cannot leave, bizarre incidents of people being killed one after another occur, and the murderer is hidden among these people. In text-based mystery games, players often need to play the role of an investigator, searching for clues and making deductions while the number of survivors decreases.</p>
<h2 id="2-Practical-Application"><a href="#2-Practical-Application" class="headerlink" title="2. Practical Application"></a>2. Practical Application</h2><h3 id="Japanese-Mystery-Games-Umineko-When-They-Cry-Return-to-Shironagasu-Island"><a href="#Japanese-Mystery-Games-Umineko-When-They-Cry-Return-to-Shironagasu-Island" class="headerlink" title="Japanese Mystery Games Umineko When They Cry &amp; Return to Shironagasu Island"></a>Japanese Mystery Games <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> &amp; <em>Return to Shironagasu Island</em></h3><p><em>Umineko When They Cry</em> is an indie text-based mystery game produced by the Japanese doujin circle 07th Expansion. The game has typical “Closed Circle” elements such as “an isolated island in a storm” and “a mansion”. (The following text is partly from the game’s website story introduction) The game story takes place on a small island called Rokkenjima. This is the location of the Ushiromiya family, a wealthy family. Every year on the first weekend of October, family members go to the island to attend a family meeting. On October 4, 1986, the family head Kinzo Ushiromiya was seriously ill, and the meeting was temporarily hosted by his eldest son Krauss. The other children were arguing over the division of the inheritance. Kinzo in the study completely disdained his vulture-like children and closed the door to concentrate on studying mysterious black magic. The grandchildren ignored the open and secret struggles between their parents and got along very harmoniously. There were also five servants in the house, three of whom were favored by the family head, and two of whom had met the family… Due to the typhoon, Rokkenjima became an isolated island cut off from the outside world. Two days later, when the typhoon subsided, the police boarded the island and saw only a horrific scene. Afterwards, someone found a letter hoping to solve the truth of the witch’s murder, making the incident a mystery that no one could solve for many years. What happened on the island during the two days when it was isolated from the world? Was it a witch’s murder or a human crime? As a suspenseful mystery work, <em>Umineko When They Cry</em> hopes that players will have fun in the process of reasoning. The player’s first goal is to solve the mystery of the “Closed Circle” murder on Rokkenjima and identify who the culprit is.</p>

The mansion “Ruisseau Sec” that the protagonist sneaks into to investigate is located on Shironagasu Island, where even the GPS positioning system fails. The game starts with a mysterious invitation to an unknown island, Shironagasu Island, in a wealthy man’s will. The protagonist of the game, Sen Ikeda, who owns a detective agency in New York, and a mysterious girl with supernatural powers, Neneko Izumozaki, board Shironagasu Island together. Many incredible things happened on Shironagasu Island, and the two also experienced multiple bizarre murders. What kind of mystery is hidden on the mysterious Shironagasu Island? The player-controlled protagonist needs to find various clues on the isolated island of Shironagasu, solve the puzzles, and then escape safely from this cursed island.</p>

In the “Closed Circle” setting, the characters in the closed space will be under the special pressure of “coexisting with unknown dangers” and “being isolated and helpless”. The trapped people in the game will start to panic, become anxious, distrust each other, and even gradually make various irrational behaviors. The protagonist controlled by the player will always be or temporarily be in a state of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Human survival instincts and fear of the unknown make players pay attention to the protagonist’s survival at all times - because they may encounter unknown dangers at any time. They don’t know what dangers lie ahead or what will happen next, and this coincides with the human psychology of innate fear of unknown things and survival instincts. In mystery games, players never know who the murderer is until the last moment. The setting of “the murderer is by my side in a closed space, but I can’t escape” can successfully awaken the player’s nervousness and fear, making the player feel as if they are experiencing it themselves, fearing the unknown.</p>
<p>Many “Closed Circle” games value the atmosphere of the entire game process more than the final ending of solving the case and finding out the true identity of the murderer. Usually, Japanese mystery games are set to have multiple endings, giving players more room for divergent thinking at the end. Many Japanese text-based mystery games also add innovative settings such as item discovery and use, countdowns, or reincarnation, parallel worlds, or superpowers to the Closed Circle setting, which makes closed-circle mystery-solving more interesting.</p>
<p>Because the “Closed Circle” setting has a good rendering effect on the game atmosphere, it has been increasingly used in domestic games of the same type in recent years. The Chinese indie game <em>Misty Summer</em> also uses the same technique, setting the murder in a mountaintop villa. The protagonist needs to spend 7 days in a mountaintop villa isolated from the outside world and find the truth of the story. Standing on the same starting line as the characters in the story, solving puzzles in a closed environment, and interacting while reading, “Closed Circle” games are often accompanied by cleverly designed “logic” and touching “plot”. Therefore, this type of game has become a paradise for reasoning enthusiasts.</p>

From the beginning, development, climax, and end of the story, each part is naturally integrated and connected, with rich and appropriate character performances. No part is too thin, and no segment is too long. For text adventure mystery games, the requirements for operation are almost zero. On the basis of abandoning the original operational gameplay of the game, text adventure mystery games pay more attention to psychological interactive gameplay. Players become the protagonists of the novel, immersed in the complete game atmosphere, shedding tears for the death of friends in the game, and trembling with excitement for their avatar, the “protagonist”, finally escaping from the isolated island, as if they had experienced all this in reality. These feedbacks are a true reflection of the player’s emotional involvement. Many players will play through a good game multiple times, and each time they will have a different emotional experience. There is a saying circulating in this circle: “First playthrough, initial contact; second playthrough, watch the plot; third playthrough, dig into the details; fourth playthrough, all achievements; fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth playthroughs, specifically for nostalgia.” This is the unique charm of text adventure mystery games that attracts players.</p>

    <title>The Survival Status of Out-of-Circle Players: Starting from the Popularity of &#39;Elden Ring&#39;</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220803/28584_1035042.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>“Elden Ring”, developed by FromSoftware, caused a craze at the beginning of this year. The influx of a large number of out-of-circle players has made the game’s player base complex and ambiguous. Can these players, who are not the target audience of “Elden Ring”, really stay in the game after experiencing it? If so, how did they stay? Out of the professional habit of a user researcher, the author has come into deep contact with players to get a glimpse of the survival status of this group of out-of-circle players.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Out-of-Circle-“Elden-Ring”"><a href="#1-The-Out-of-Circle-“Elden-Ring”" class="headerlink" title="1. The Out-of-Circle “Elden Ring”"></a>1. The Out-of-Circle “Elden Ring”</h2><p>On February 25, 2022, the gaming community experienced a carnival. The name of this carnival was “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>Winning the TGA’s Most Anticipated Game award for two consecutive years, the player test version before the official release, and the high media score of 97 all made this game the “white moonlight” in the hearts of many game players. The game’s performance after its launch also lived up to expectations. Despite encountering optimization problems, just a few days after its launch, the peak number of online players on Steam reached nearly 900,000, reaching the seventh highest peak in the history of Steam online player count, far exceeding its predecessors “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” and “Dark Souls 3”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2F1a99bd9b-7031-471c-950b-db84df9dc38b.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;1a99bd9b-7031-471c-950b-db84df9dc38b.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>As of 2022.3.7, comparison of the peak number of players in the Soul series games, data source: SteamDB</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The extent to which “Elden Ring” has gone out of the circle is even greater than that of “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” last time.</p>
<p>The term “out-of-circle” was originally used mostly in the entertainment industry, generally referring to a person or work breaking through its original small circle and being accepted and recognized by more people. Now, the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring” means the same thing - the original Soul series players often stayed within their own community, especially in the early years of “Demon’s Souls”, “Dark Souls 1”, and “Dark Souls 2”, where there were very few players. Even for the later best-selling “Dark Souls 3”, due to the ban on domestic live broadcast platforms, it was only a niche masterpiece in the eyes of passers-by. Against this background, Soul series players formed their own unique small circle and circle culture. However, this small circle has been gradually broken by live broadcasts and short videos in recent years. A large number of cloud players and new players converted from cloud players have poured in, making Soul series games gradually move to a larger stage. And “Elden Ring” is undoubtedly the center of attention.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring”, including the game’s own design, long-term publicity and build-up, and the differentiation provided due to game homogeneity in the industry. We can also pay attention to the long-term, short-term, beneficial, and unfavorable impacts that this “out-of-circle” has brought to Elden Ring. However, out of the professional habit of user research, I am more curious about the new players brought about by the “out-of-circle” of “Elden Ring”. They have never been exposed to or at least have never played Soul series games themselves before, and their understanding of this type of game is largely limited to impressions such as “difficult”, “dark”, and “suffering”. Their reasons for buying the game may be to follow the trend, to try something new, or to be very confident in their own operational skills and want to challenge this so-called game that makes clumsy players quit.</p>
<p>In the following text, we may as well call these players “out-of-circle players” - although they are essentially new players, this time the new players have exceeded the normal player turnover rhythm of the game. A large number of casual players, MMO players, MOBA players and other types of players, and even players who may have never played games before, have poured into this party, making the entire game player group a mixed bag. It is difficult for us to truly understand what these players are like. Everyone’s reasons for joining the party are different, and players’ preferences often vary from person to person. However, we can always see some commonalities of these players from some cases. Coincidentally, I have several such out-of-circle players around me. From them, we may be able to see the current survival status of out-of-circle players in “Elden Ring”, making the fog surrounding the out-of-circle players a little clearer.</p>
<h2 id="2-Case-1-The-Clumsy-“Spiderman”-Ring"><a href="#2-Case-1-The-Clumsy-“Spiderman”-Ring" class="headerlink" title="2. Case 1: The Clumsy “Spiderman” Ring"></a>2. Case 1: The Clumsy “Spiderman” Ring</h2><p>“Spiderman” (pseudonym) is my best friend.</p>
<p>The year before last, when I was fighting fiercely with Isshin Ashina in “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, “Spiderman” let me experience what it’s like to be a live streamer for the first time. He watched me almost all the way through “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, and I didn’t hesitate to share my real-time tactics and understanding of the game during the game - although these didn’t seem to have much effect. My experience sharing didn’t help him get started better. He was still flustered when facing the first BOSS. After being defeated by the BOSS several times without taking damage, he put down the controller helplessly and chose to complete the game via watching others play.</p>
<p>But in fact, I can totally understand “Spiderman”. As a 9-to-6 office worker in the online education industry, he has to prepare lesson plans and teaching plans when he goes to work, and after work and on weekends, he has to turn on the camera and diligently irrigate the flowers of the motherland. His free time is scarce and fragmented. He was even preparing lesson plans on New Year’s Eve: when we were joking in a WeChat video call, he was wearing pajamas, with messy hair like a bird’s nest, writing hard on the computer, as if he had just woken up. If it weren’t for Jia Ling’s voice on TV being too recognizable, I would have even thought it was still early morning.</p>
<p>Games are not a necessity for “Spiderman”, nor are they his only entertainment activity. They are more like a theme or direction for him to seek entertainment - he doesn’t necessarily have to play them himself. The gossip and memes of the professional player circle, the live broadcasts of major games, and the wonderful game clips on Douyin (TikTok) are what really attract him. He hasn’t played many games of LOL, but he can accurately name the skills and ultimate moves of each hero in each LPL game; he hasn’t played “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” much, but he knows the skills of the BOSSes in “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice” like the back of his hand; he has fewer than 30 games in his own Steam library, and the total game time is less than 100 hours, but he seems to be a seasoned game master.</p>
<p>“Spiderman” is very clear about the reason why he can’t play games: “Poor reaction, can’t judge the moves. I can only run around, and the attack is inefficient, which is very frustrating.” He also tried to look at guides, but “it’s useless, there’s no way to cheese it.” But knowing is one thing, and he still enjoys buying some games that he can’t beat, such as “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”, “Monster Hunter”, and this time’s “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>He seems to be confident in his gaming skills, as if he has forgotten his painful experience in Sekiro: “It’s an open world, you can leave the BOSS alone for now, and then go back to fight it after leveling up.”</p>
<p>“And if you can’t beat it, you can just refund it.”</p>
<p>Then, his words came true. From launch to refund, “Spiderman” spent a total of 0.8 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2Fc1fa26cf-173a-40de-a60c-ed6b50658191.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;c1fa26cf-173a-40de-a60c-ed6b50658191.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>“Spiderman”‘s recent play history, “Elden Ring” is forever stuck at 0.8 hours</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When I asked “Spiderman” about the reason for pre-ordering “Elden Ring”, he replied to me in 0.1 seconds on WeChat:</p>
<p>“Following the trend.” Then he spent another 30 seconds giving the second reason: “The media reviews are very high.”</p>
<p>According to him, many of his colleagues and classmates around him have bought “Elden Ring”, but few of them have stayed. The difficulty of the game not only discouraged him, but also discouraged a large circle of friends around him.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that even though he has been discouraged time and time again, “Spiderman” has not shown a strong aversion to Soulslike games. He has always had a considerable degree of goodwill towards the game, which comes from the game’s fragmented narrative, riddle-like plot, and bizarre worldview.</p>
<p>He bluntly stated that when the next Soulslike game comes out, he will still consider pre-ordering it–</p>
<p>“I always feel like I can do it. I bought ‘Sekiro’. I’m a collector, I don’t have to play it, but I have to have it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it would be better if there was dynamic difficulty.”</p>
<p>I seemed to see the pure and simple smile of this northern man through the phone screen.</p>
<p>h2&gt;3. Case 2: The Amazing “Captain Marvel”</p>
<p>Through “Spiderman”, I felt that I had figured out the survival status of this group of out-of-circle players, but the case from “Captain Marvel” (pseudonym) gave me some new insights into this group of players.</p>
<p>The “out-of-circle” effect of “Elden Ring” on “Captain Marvel” actually came from some very accidental factors. According to her, it mainly came from three aspects. The first is the overwhelming sharing of “Elden Ring” seen in her Moments, the second is the public opinion bombardment of high-scoring media (“I feel like I’m missing out if I don’t play it”), and the third is the game promotion pictures that she accidentally saw, which looked sunny, with beautiful scenery, and seemed like a paradise. If the first point represents following the trend and professional instinct (like me, “Captain Marvel” also belongs to the user experience department), the second point represents game quality and public opinion publicity, and the third point is a real personal preference - “I don’t really like the dark style of Dark Souls. This time, the promotional pictures of ‘Elden Ring’ are not so dark. The overworld looks quite ‘sunny’.”</p>
<p>But “luring them in” is one thing, whether they can play it or not is another. After all, in my impression, “Captain Marvel” is not a fan of Soulslike games. The game she played the most before was actually an MMO game. According to my observations, I can reasonably believe that the label “action game klutz” is very suitable for her.</p>
<p>And her real gaming experience did prove this.</p>
<p>“After being abused in ‘Elden Ring’ for a day, I quit the game and realized how beautiful the world is.” This was her first-day evaluation of “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>During the first day, she didn’t dare to fight the BOSS at all, just ran around to open up the map. After opening 8 maps, she was still carrying the novice’s broken shield and broken sword. Finally, she looked at related videos and guides online and decided to give up her current class and choose the more powerful and easy-to-use mage class. These series of operations, which are incomprehensible to veteran Soulslike players, very realistically reflect the game path of out-of-circle players represented by her in the game.</p>
<p>Just when I thought this was another sad story of discouragement, the situation seemed to be a little different.</p>
<p>After restarting the game as a mage, her game path became smooth again. With the help of guides, she not only successfully walked out of the novice dungeon, but also defeated one or two small BOSSes, and temporarily survived safely in this game.</p>
<p>“Captain Marvel”‘s “retention” in “Elden Ring” is largely due to her own “alternative” pursuits and playstyles in the game. When she played “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” before, she was obsessed with opening up the map everywhere, unlocking shrines one by one according to the guides (but not completing the shrines), and then heading to the next shrine. In “Naraka: Bladepoint”, she rarely plays ranked matches. She has no interest in practicing her skills, but she is very fond of costumes and character customization. This “alternative” is reflected in “Elden Ring” as: she doesn’t like to challenge difficult BOSSes like ordinary players, but prefers to collect strange equipment, weapons and spells. “Elden Bling”, indeed.</p>
<p>With the expectation of these contents, “Captain Marvel” has, to a certain extent, overcome those uncomfortable experiences (the gloomy dungeons, the instant-killing small monsters), and has become a retained player of “Elden Ring”.</p>
<p>h2&gt;4. Some Thoughts on Out-of-Circle and Out-of-Circle Players</p>
<p>“Seeing a falling leaf, one knows autumn is coming; seeing a leopard’s spot, one can see the whole leopard.”</p>
<p>There are actually many cases like “Spiderman” and “Captain Marvel”, but most of them are not around me, so I can only get a glimpse of the survival status of these players from the bits and pieces on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Following the trend” is often the main reason why these players choose to try the game. It’s just that the specific forms may be different for different players. “Spiderman” comes from daily communication with classmates and colleagues, while “Captain Marvel” comes from the “unpaid promotion” of social platforms. We can also imagine that some players come from QQ groups or WeChat groups of other games. For example, a certain “Naraka: Bladepoint” player suddenly pops up in his small group: I’m stuck on a BOSS, is there any other Elden Ring player who can help me?</p>
<p>The “out-of-circle” of Elden Ring is also due to the game’s good publicity and promotion on another level. Some of these promotions are deliberately done by the publisher or developer, such as the game’s early trials, cooperation with the famous fantasy writer George R.R. Martin, epic promotional CGs, etc., while others come from the praise of the media and players, which is a chain reaction brought about by the quality of the game. The high score of 97 is rare in recent years, and there is a feeling of “you’ll miss out if you don’t play it, you have to try it even if you just want to taste it”. Finally, the viral spread of live broadcasts and short videos has also well reached these non-game players who may not usually pay attention to game information. Some obvious evidence is that some of my friends who never play games and only watch Douyin (TikTok) occasionally ask me what kind of game this is.</p>
<p>From the cases of “Spiderman” and “Captain Marvel”, we can actually see another clue that made them “out-of-circle”, that is, the game itself is releasing some signals to welcome new players. Concerns about difficulty are dispelled by the setting of leveling up, the brighter and more open overworld provides a buffer for some “claustrophobic” players, the open world design also attracts more players who like to explore, and the cooperation with George R.R. Martin has also attracted a group of fans of Western fantasy plots to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Behind Elden Ring’s strong fan-drawing speed, we also have to admit that a large part of out-of-circle players are like my “Spiderman” friend, who found a game that is not suitable for them in the blind trend. Judging from the completion rate of Steam achievements, most players haven’t even met the novice BOSS in the game before choosing to end it hastily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220803%2Febb18c90-3172-4779-8ff9-52fd9bb1a411.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220803&#x2F;ebb18c90-3172-4779-8ff9-52fd9bb1a411.png"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Steam “Elden Ring” global achievement completion rate, one-third of players did not pass the first BOSS</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The retention of out-of-circle players is always an epic problem facing out-of-circle games. Because it involves two issues at the same time, one is the question of “whether there is”, and the other is the question of “whether it is enough”.</p>
<p>We cannot expect all players to be the target audience of the game, and after trying the game, they will be pleasantly surprised to find that this game is exactly what they want, and become addicted to it. Those out-of-circle players who have successfully stayed are more like “Captain Marvel”, who have found their own unique preferences and goals in the game, regardless of whether these goals are the core highlights of the game. The existence of these goals and preferences allows them to accept to a certain extent, or actively seek some ways to overcome the negative experiences brought about by the game. The existence or absence of a goal is the question of “whether there is”.</p>
<p>Player retention is often a process of game between the game’s attraction points and pain points for them. Whether the attraction point is strong enough is the question of “whether it is enough”. “Spiderman”‘s departure was because he couldn’t solve the problem of being clumsy, and the attraction of the worldview and plot to him was diluted by short videos and live broadcasts; “Captain Marvel” chose to stay because her goals in the game were strong enough (“Elden Bling”), and she also found a good way to solve the difficulty problem (looking at guides). The departure and stay of every player are all like this.</p>
<p>From this point of view, if you want to keep my “Spiderman” friend, you may really need to wait until the day when the game has dynamic difficulty, or the short video platform disappears overnight. It’s just that I don’t think this day will ever come.</p>

    <title>Are Voice Actors All Monsters? Unveiling the Voice Acting of *Naraka: Bladepoint*</title>
    <url>/2022/08/03/netease-ux-articles/news_20220812_28584_1036852/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220812/28584_1036852.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Games can immerse us in another world, providing completely different experiences and adding more entertainment to our original work and life. With the rapid development of the game market, players’ requirements for game quality are getting higher and higher, and they have increasingly higher standards in terms of plot, graphics, sound, and sense of immersion. This article will explore the importance of game voice acting and how to enhance the player’s game experience through good voice acting.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Importance-of-Localized-Voice-Acting-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-Importance-of-Localized-Voice-Acting-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance of Localized Voice Acting in Games"></a>1. The Importance of Localized Voice Acting in Games</h2><p>When you open a game, the most attractive things are the graphics, the character voices, and the feel of the controls. When players interact deeply with the game content using the characters in the game, the graphics and voice acting can instantly bring the players into the game world. Sound is the most perceptible element besides the graphics. As an important factor to enhance the player’s sense of immersion, game voice acting can shape the character’s personality in a variety of ways, while giving the character unique marks and emotional expressions, enhancing the fullness of the game character and the on-site experience.</p>
<p>In 2021, the multiplayer competitive game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, produced by NetEase’s 24 Entertainment, reached a peak of 121,513 online players on the first day of its global public beta on Steam. So far, global sales have exceeded 10 million copies, and it is sought after and loved by many players at home and abroad. Analyzing the reasons for the success of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> overseas, it can be seen that the game features that attract players and localization that meets the national conditions of various countries are indispensable. Among them, localized voice acting and lip-sync matching can provide players with a stronger sense of immersion and engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F31c960c3-0adc-4e2d-aa85-bd4eba20933c.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;31c960c3-0adc-4e2d-aa85-bd4eba20933c.png"></p>
<h2 id="2-Why-is-Japanese-Voice-Acting-Popular-with-Players"><a href="#2-Why-is-Japanese-Voice-Acting-Popular-with-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is Japanese Voice Acting Popular with Players?"></a>2. Why is Japanese Voice Acting Popular with Players?</h2><p>Players around the world generally accept Japanese voice acting more than other languages. Why is this?</p>
<p>First of all, Japan has a large number of anime works, which makes its voice actor market relatively mature and standardized, and the whole process service is relatively complete and convenient. The level of Japanese voice actors is often the quality benchmark of the industry. Even if you don’t understand the language, you can still perceive all the subtle expressions, such as emotion, rhythm, and tone. With actions, even if you don’t understand Japanese dialogue, you still won’t be affected by understanding, so many players like to listen to Japanese voice acting even if they don’t understand Japanese.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are a large number of target groups around the world who like two-dimensional games, and they generally have a high acceptance of Japanese. I believe that most players who like to play two-dimensional style games are familiar with Japanese two-dimensional culture, and have a lot of contact with Japanese anime and games. Therefore, sometimes they are more accustomed to listening to Japanese voice acting than their native language.</p>
<p>In addition, some players also have their favorite Japanese voice actors. These Japanese voice actors can be promoted as highlights of the game, and can also increase the popularity of the game, which is a win-win for game manufacturers.</p>
<p>Here is a story about the voice acting of a very popular hero in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</p>
<p>Before the launch of the new hero Wuchen, Japanese players on social media accounts such as Twitter had very high calls for Hanae Natsuki. For netizens who are familiar with the two-dimensional field, they must have heard of the name of this popular voice actor. For example, the protagonist of the popular anime <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>, Kamado Tanjiro, and many other characters are voiced by him. Therefore, considering the high matching degree between Hanae and Wuchen, and in order to meet the needs of players to the greatest extent, the official decided to invite Hanae Natsuki to voice the role of Wuchen.</p>
<p>Whether it is the outstanding character design or the powerful ultimate skills, Wuchen has a very high appeal, and the discussion among Chinese and foreign players is good. On this basis, Wuchen’s voice is very outstanding, making this character widely welcomed by players, especially in the Japanese server, so that many domestic players want to transfer to the Japanese server to play.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Hanae Natsuki himself is a well-known fan of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. He has broadcast live games with his friend Ono Kensho many times, and there are many netizens watching on the external network. He has also used his love to promote the game for free many times. Before Hanae was invited by the official, his other voice actor friend Ishikawa Kaito successfully got the Japanese voice acting of the hero Yueshan in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Hanae Natsuki also started the “comment mode” with great interest during the live broadcast, and expressed that he was very envious and hoped that he could have the opportunity.</p>
<p>When we invited him, he happened to be busy with the voice acting of other anime at that time, but as soon as he heard that it was the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, he immediately said that even if he had to work overtime on his days off, he would be Wuchen’s voice actor. In fact, it was not only him who was happy about the success of this cooperation, but the fans were also very happy, because Hanae Natsuki’s voice acting was indeed very exciting, and he perfectly interpreted Wuchen’s style. Many Japanese players said that they started to play the game because of Hanae’s voice acting. There are also many domestic netizens who are begging the official to add a voice adjustment function in the game.</p>

<h2 id="3-Why-is-the-Voice-Acting-of-Excellent-Games-Excellent"><a href="#3-Why-is-the-Voice-Acting-of-Excellent-Games-Excellent" class="headerlink" title="3. Why is the Voice Acting of Excellent Games Excellent?"></a>3. Why is the Voice Acting of Excellent Games Excellent?</h2><p>First of all, the voice acting of mature games has a very complete voice acting process, from script localization and polishing, voice actor selection (on-site casting), voice actor appointment schedule, inviting directors, planning and localization teams to observe and supervise online, to audio QA, etc., there are very strict quality controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fb3e8fa0d-6acb-48c0-9170-f05ddf455d19.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;b3e8fa0d-6acb-48c0-9170-f05ddf455d19.png"></p>
<p>The excellent voice acting is very strict when selecting voice actors, because good voice acting quality control can make players feel that the game is more fun. When choosing voice actors, many game companies will hire celebrities to do the voice acting, but can celebrity voice acting really improve the sense of immersion and game quality?</p>
<p>In fact, when we choose voice actors, the most important thing is not necessarily the popularity of the voice actor, but the fit between the character style and the voice actor. Does the voice actor’s voice and timbre match the character’s personality? Can it well reflect the character’s personality traits? In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, there are more than 10 heroes on the stage, and the age, personality and image of each character are completely different. The personalities of these heroes need to be embodied through appearance and sound. Therefore, when conducting localized voice acting, we pay the most attention to the degree of adaptation. If on this basis, the voice actor has both the characteristics of large traffic and explosive points, and can cooperate with marketing and publicity activities, that is the most perfect.</p>
<p>So what is the actual selection process like? The voice actors of the main game characters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> are selected through the script of the characters actually appearing in the game. When casting, two or more voice actors are allowed to voice the same role, and then the voice actor who best fits the role is selected. Compared with casting from an existing voice actor resource pool, this method may require relatively more time and cost. The voice actors of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> have up to 3 interviews for each game character. When choosing voice actors, not only should we pay attention to the voice actor’s intonation, timbre, voice line, and acting style, but also consider the treatment of the ending of the word under the background of that era. For example, when doing Japanese voice acting, if it is a samurai’s line, the words will be adjusted according to the background of the time, and some ancient expressions will be used to reflect the era at that time, and at the same time, the ending of the speech will be adjusted to fit the world view. Similar processing is also required for Korean voice acting.</p>

<p>During the epidemic, because we could not supervise the studio on-site, we adopted a remote meeting that could share sound and script at the same time for online observation. During voice acting, we will invite colleagues from the planning, audio, and localization teams to check together. Very ideal results were achieved through systematic preparation beforehand. Although colleagues from the planning and audio groups may not understand the foreign language, they can give guidance on the character’s voice and timbre. Before recording, colleagues from the localization team will discuss the controversial content in the translated script, and sometimes they will work hard to find more natural and appropriate expressions. At the recording site, the localization colleagues will also control the voice actor’s interpretation of the lines, as well as the matching degree of the voice recording with the environment, character design, and line atmosphere, so as to improve the expressiveness of each word and each line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F6443a4ab-ffa2-44a2-a64c-a7e1944d1ffb.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;6443a4ab-ffa2-44a2-a64c-a7e1944d1ffb.png"></p>
<p>After the audio recording is completed, there is one last step, which is the quality test (QA) of the audio. QA testers are the final quality controllers before the game works are presented to players. Our QA is responsible for identifying all critical issues, such as compliance, audio errors, CERO regulations (applicable to Japan) issues, and any issues related to the culture of the overseas region, to ensure that the launched product is free of any risks.</p>
<h2 id="4-Precautions-for-Voice-Acting-and-Processing-in-Naraka-Bladepoint"><a href="#4-Precautions-for-Voice-Acting-and-Processing-in-Naraka-Bladepoint" class="headerlink" title="4. Precautions for Voice Acting and Processing in Naraka: Bladepoint"></a>4. Precautions for Voice Acting and Processing in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></h2><p>Game voice acting is a professional project in which voice actors use their voices and words to portray and create various vivid character images with distinct personalities in front of the microphone. In this process, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of voice acting work and skills, and to create good works and improve the quality of voice acting in accordance with the artistic laws of voice acting work.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-Breathiness-and-How-to-Deal-with-It"><a href="#What-is-Breathiness-and-How-to-Deal-with-It" class="headerlink" title="What is Breathiness and How to Deal with It"></a>What is Breathiness and How to Deal with It</h3><p>Friends who are new to voice acting usually unconsciously ignore “breathiness”. They always think that voice acting mainly matches the dialogue, staring with wide eyes to find the lip shape, and dare not miss a single sentence or word. As a result, they do not notice the breath sound naturally produced by the actor when speaking. Sometimes, although the dialogue dubbed by the voice actor is very accurate, because the breath sound is lost, the dialogue sounds unnatural, and even feels stiff. Even if you already feel that you are very involved in the emotion, you still can’t feel the due atmosphere and tone. Some actors even like to speak with stuttering movements or breathy voices because of their personal performance habits, which makes the dubbing inaccurate.</p>
<p>In fact, “breath sound” is a very important part of voice acting. All the necessary breath sounds must be present, but none of the unnecessary breath sounds should be present.</p>
<p>How should we deal with “unnecessary breath sounds”?</p>
<p>First of all, when dubbing the dialogue, if the voice actor cannot use the “dantian” and only pronounces in the way of speaking normally, it is not only difficult to accurately match the mouth, but also easy to produce the sound of their own breathing, which is a noise and is to be NG.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the recording studio, you must always keep quiet and slow breathing, otherwise the sensitive microphone will pick up the sound of breathing like a bellows, which is naturally not allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, the breath sounds made in cooperation with the actor’s actions, such as chasing and running, carrying heavy objects, fighting, getting angry, etc., must clearly show the distance, time, space and other conditions on the screen, and more importantly, match the lip shape. Too much is also an “unnecessary breath sound”.</p>
<p>As an extremely critical part of voice acting, the rhythm of breath stop and continuation, length, strength, and tightness can all express the psychological rhythm of the character. In addition, “sound is produced when breath moves”, so “sound” is inseparable from breathing. The breathing matched with different words in different states is not the same, but there is no doubt that breath is a necessary condition for voice acting. Slight changes in mouth shape, breath sound resonance position, certain changes and control of the vocal cords and throat, and adjustment of tone, timbre and voice quality can all produce a voice different from your own. Coupled with the imitation of language style, it is not difficult to create a voice completely different from your own and become a new character role.</p>
<p>Voice acting needs to do a good job in the three aspects of emotion, voice, and breath, namely “emotion, voice, and breath”. Breath moves with emotion, and sound comes out with emotion. Breath is born from emotion and melts into sound. Voice actors should use their voices to interpret and interpret the characters, giving them souls and vitality; they should also convey information and communicate emotions with listeners. Therefore, in order to better convey emotions and ideas, voice actors need to have emotional color in their language. The perfect combination and flexible use of “emotion, voice, and breath” can improve the unity of freedom and controllability of voice acting, and present the spiritual connotation of the work itself to the greatest extent.</p>
<h3 id="Misunderstandings-Caused-by-the-McGurk-Effect"><a href="#Misunderstandings-Caused-by-the-McGurk-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Misunderstandings Caused by the McGurk Effect"></a>Misunderstandings Caused by the McGurk Effect</h3><p>The ears and eyes are our windows to observe the world. The ears “hear” things, and the eyes “see” things. They seem to be working independently and unconnected, but in fact they are connected. But many people don’t know that hearing and vision can also interfere with each other.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, in order to explore whether vision affects people’s speech perception, that is, whether vision affects hearing, psychologists Harry McGurk and John MacDonald of the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom did such an experiment: They found some adults to watch a video, in which the person’s lips made the sound of “ga”, but the dubbed sound was “ba”. As a result, 98% of the subjects said they heard the sound of “da”. This is caused by the mismatch between dubbing and lip shape. More precisely, it is due to the combined effect of vision and hearing, creating a third sound that does not exist - the “da” sound, which is the McGurk effect. What if it’s the other way around? The person in the video makes the sound of “ba” with their lips, but it is dubbed with “ga”. As a result, about 54% of the subjects heard “gabga” or “bagba”, and the McGurk effect is also obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5d7fe844-fdfa-4523-83ca-a2d5ca2c8726.jpg/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;5d7fe844-fdfa-4523-83ca-a2d5ca2c8726.jpg"></p>
<p>The McGurk effect shows that when the information received by vision and the information received by hearing are inconsistent, the intervention of visual information will affect the expression of auditory information, causing people to hear the wrong third sound.</p>
<h3 id="How-does-Naraka-Bladepoint-eliminate-the-McGurk-effect-through-AI"><a href="#How-does-Naraka-Bladepoint-eliminate-the-McGurk-effect-through-AI" class="headerlink" title="How does Naraka: Bladepoint eliminate the McGurk effect through AI?"></a>How does <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> eliminate the McGurk effect through AI?</h3><p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, in order to eliminate the McGurk effect, we adjust the character’s lip shape through AI to make it consistent with the character’s lines. So how do we do it?</p>
<p>This is achieved by integrating AI technology to simplify complexity, based on algorithm automatic generation, successfully simplifying the original time-consuming and labor-intensive problem into content that can be perfectly output in a few days. This greatly saves labor costs and time costs, making the impossible possible. In addition to automatic adaptation, there is also a multi-language audio inspection function, which uses machines to ensure the accuracy of lip shapes. In addition, the lip-sync prediction controller data and batch replacement of lip-sync animation further improve the speed of outputting adapted lip-sync. This technology has been applied to multiple language versions of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and will continue to be applied to other overseas games.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Allowing players around the world to find happiness in the games they develop may be the dream of every game producer. With the improvement of global distribution channels and the maturity of technology, more and more games choose to be released globally. In the process of global distribution, game localization voice acting has become a very critical link. In order to allow players from different cultural backgrounds and different languages to understand the game well, voice acting needs to be as close as possible to the character positioning, lip movements, and story background in the game, with the intention of providing a more immersive game experience for global players.</p>

    <title>Avatar Design from the Perspective of Game Social Interaction</title>
    <url>/2022/08/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20220812_28584_1036865/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220812/28584_1036865.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the rise of the metaverse, concepts such as virtual avatars and virtual social interaction have also become popular terms. In fact, avatars and virtual social interaction are not new concepts in games.</p>
<p>The word “avatar” comes from Sanskrit and means “a god appearing on earth in physical form.” In games, players are the “gods” who control the fate of their characters.</p>
<p>Thanks to the innate emotional talent of human beings, we can always easily “project” our physical and psychological conditions onto other things. The construction and identification of avatars in games are often a mapping of players’ self-awareness or desires. This strong personal characteristic is the basis for establishing social interactions and attracting others. Conversely, social interaction stems from players’ needs for emotion and belonging, and is an external manifestation of players’ higher-level psychological needs. Therefore, this mapping relationship will also have corresponding requirements for the design of the avatar. This article will explore the design possibilities of virtual avatars from the perspective of players’ psychological needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification"></a>1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification</h2><p>Game social interaction stems from players’ pursuit of a sense of identity and belonging. In order to meet this demand, the primary task is to enhance players’ empowerment and identification with their avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Self-empowerment:</strong> Believing that you have the power to control your own life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avatar identification:</strong> A psychological phenomenon in which an individual’s self-perception changes temporarily during the process of using and experiencing a game avatar, and the emotional and cognitive connection with the avatar is strengthened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization"><a href="#Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization"></a>Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization</h3><p><em>“An ideal avatar carries the player’s aesthetics, taste, and personal pursuits.”</em></p>
<p>Similar to social interaction in our real lives, our first impression of a person is often based on their physical characteristics, such as height, weight, skin color, hairstyle, etc., and then we further understand their identity, occupation, interests, and other aspects.</p>
<p>In games, how can players have the same emotional experience with virtual character images as in real social interactions, as opposed to ordinary NPCs? Sufficient identity recognition is essential. When the player’s identity characteristics are fully recognized, the player’s social window is truly opened. For example, the most basic: name, gender, identity, skills, dynamics, social relationship information, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5e6336fd-783b-4a54-9b94-06dceca8d724.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Diagram: Four types of information for avatar construction and mapping</em></p>
<hr>
<p>As shown in the figure above, we can divide the information that players give to virtual characters into four categories. Among them, basic information, characteristic information, and image design often give players the freedom to design themselves, encouraging players to create identity characteristics, and allowing players to gradually establish familiarity and ownership of the avatar.</p>
<p>In MMO games such as <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the first thing players perceive is the character creation system, which allows players to immediately immerse themselves in character design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5b75b6b4-e3a4-4dd8-bb45-e19358009b89.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>Character customization is also a major gameplay element, but not all players have proficient character customization skills. Many games, in order to allow players to experience more fun in character customization, will refine the operation of character customization, enrich the styles of different face shapes and makeup, and ensure that the characters created by players can satisfy themselves. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has hundreds of character customization materials, allowing players to create their favorite styles and shapes as they wish. Some players even have great ideas and create many funny images. </p>

<hr>
<p>In addition, in the process of image design, surrounding elements such as environment and props can also be used to present personal interests and tastes, which not only enhances the personal attributes of the player’s character, but also provides a basis for the extensibility of design and the sustainability of social interaction in the game. </p>

<p>Unlike ideal avatars, blank avatars prefer relatively symbolic characters. American cartoonist Scott McCloud put forward an interesting point in his book “Understanding Comics”: the fewer details a character has, the more likely the reader is to project himself into that character. When players combine a symbolic character with a meticulously described world, they can generate a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, the player’s avatar often appears in a minimalist form. The game enhances the player’s sense of immersion through the design of the environment and sound. The blank space of imagination and the atmosphere rendering of the environment—this strong contrast enhances the player’s self-empowerment and identification with the avatar, ignoring the difference between the “avatar character” and themselves. </p>

The frontstage is where the avatar is concentrated, and it is the self-presentation where self-characteristics match character characteristics.</p>
<p>Players can present themselves through interactive designs in the game, enrich the character characteristics of the avatar, and attract the attention and recognition of other players.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-Interaction-Design"><a href="#Avatar-Interaction-Design" class="headerlink" title="Avatar Interaction Design"></a>Avatar Interaction Design</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Daily interaction:</strong> Give the avatar character traits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactive design and script design of the avatar itself, such as sound, dialogue, and actions, are important elements that help players achieve self-presentation during group interactions. In addition, real-time interactions such as text, likes, comments, voice, emoticons, and gifts can help players enrich their own character settings during social interactions, and enhance the fun and richness of social interactions.</p>
<p>The chat system of <em>Revelation Mobile</em> is similar to social software in real life. Players can use personalized chat methods and display their personality in real time through text, emoticons, voice and other chat tools, making the personality image of the avatar more vivid and three-dimensional. In addition, designs such as colored text and text shortcuts in the game make this chat tool more playable. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interest interaction:</strong> Show personal hobbies and specialties</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the player’s voice and various music-based gameplays are distinctive features that run throughout the game. This kind of interest interaction fully demonstrates the player’s self-characteristics and integrates personal characteristics into the role, and also provides the possibility of expanding social scenarios. For example, the tea room is designed based on the players’ common interest in music. In addition to exploring the love of music, traditional culture, painting hobbies, etc. can also be integrated into the game to strengthen the interactive design of the avatar. </p>

<p>Encouraging players to use the avatar’s actions to develop behavioral habits is also an important factor in the interaction between players. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, there are many tasks that require players to use emotional actions on NPCs, such as encouraging, comforting, and touching NPCs. This process will continue to strengthen the player’s positive emotions. Since there are many such tasks, players will naturally get used to putting commonly used emotional actions on the shortcut bar. In this way, the threshold for interacting with other players is also very low. After everyone finishes the dungeon and meets acquaintances in the wild, they will easily make a gesture to say hello, which is much more convenient than typing in the chat box. </p>

<li><strong>Emotional interaction:</strong> Enhance the emotional characteristics of the avatar</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players help each other to present themselves step by step through cognition and emotional progression, and gradually deepen their connection with each other. For example, by lighting the candles of other players’ avatars, they will change from small gray people to a state with a special decoration—this is the first step in interacting with people; further, players can also give nicknames to other players to deepen their memory of each other, and so on. </p>

<h3 id="Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification"><a href="#Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification" class="headerlink" title="Group Interaction and Group Identification"></a>Group Interaction and Group Identification</h3><p>Group identification is the process of classifying people or things, emphasizing common destiny, common goals, common emotions, and the interdependence of group members. The construction of group identification is mainly completed in the process of intra-group and inter-group interactions.</p>
<p>The essence of game social interaction is to achieve the goal of group interaction and group identification through joint participation. In games, ultra-temporal connections provide a situational basis for players to participate together, without considering the distance of reality. Players generate emotions due to their common love, making members naturally form a psychological feeling of “being together” or “being one of us”. Group interaction and group identification require effective social scenarios, and different social scenarios and experiences will also have different requirements for the design of avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar identity design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In games, social scenarios are created for players through task design, challenge design, reward design, and intimate interaction design.</p>
<p>In these group gameplays, in order to facilitate group interaction, more member identity designs and corresponding character assignments are needed, and there should be differentiated gameplay when players join the group. This can be achieved through daily gameplay. When a player joins a group, the administrator should immediately set an identity for him and inform him of the corresponding tasks he needs to do immediately. In this way, differentiation can be expanded through subdivision, the player’s interest chain can be built, and a reasonable scene for social interaction can be created. Games such as <em>Identity V</em>, Werewolf, and LARP (Live Action Role Playing) fully mobilize the players’ subjective initiative with such character identity settings. In some battle scenarios, the matching methods of top lane, middle lane, bottom lane, jungle, and support also strengthen the players’ interest chain and promote the division of labor and cooperation among players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fbd539c22-5e84-4441-8986-5c41049ae829.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Character profiles in “Identity V”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar relationship setting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpersonal pattern of closeness and distance is called the “differential order pattern”. Like ripples spreading on the water surface, it extends from oneself, circle by circle, and divides closeness and distance according to the distance, as shown in the figure below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F774229e3-15a6-4162-abf7-911b0f3cde93.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the group interaction of the game, the relationship setting between avatars can expand more social scenarios. For example, the common relationship settings such as master and apprentice, husband and wife, and gang can trigger different gameplays. Through this relationship setting and gameplay design, players are stimulated to communicate and collaborate with strangers, creating emotional bonds. Players can experience the ambiguity and warmth with the opposite sex in the game, and the communication and cooperation between teams or other groups, so as to achieve the social goals of group interaction and group identification. The gameplay of companionship, bonding, marriage, master-apprentice, grudge, and sect in <em>Revelation</em> applies this relationship setting method. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F857faeae-44b2-4195-b23f-c12b6235e4ab.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar display design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting personal business cards (equipment, titles, achievements, battle records, clearance progress, collection progress, etc.) in the display system is conducive to gaining the attention and recognition of others, satisfying the players’ desire to show off, and plays an important role in the establishment of social relationships. Designs such as likes, sending flowers, worship, and the display of top-ranked player models can not only increase the display effect, but also enhance the interaction between players.</p>
<p>Both <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and <em>Revelation</em> have leaderboard display designs, which can increase users’ group attention and help and encourage users to obtain group identification. In <em>Revelation</em>, when players team up, they can also click on the character card to view detailed information and perform dynamic interactions such as “send gifts” and “step on”. Obtaining the attention of other players through the avatar display system is also one of the ways to gain a sense of identity. </p>

<h2 id="3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design"><a href="#3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design"></a>3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design</h2><p>The popular metaverse social interaction not only has the shadow of virtual social interaction, but also has the characteristics of physical social interaction. It uses technologies such as AR, VR, and XR to build a holographic virtual reality platform. The interaction between us and our friends is no longer just simple voice, text, pictures, and videos. We can also go shopping, watch concerts, and play games together. Everyone does not have to worry about time and space, but enjoy an immersive experience.</p>
<p>With the metaverse empowering the game industry, the terminal devices that carry games will also be iterated, and the game industry may enter an era of wearable devices with VR&#x2F;AR and other technologies as the core. The concept of the metaverse has spawned a large number of VR&#x2F;AR technology implementations. Users can enter virtual reality scenes by wearing VR helmets, AR glasses and other devices to achieve an immersive experience.</p>
<p>The high picture quality and strong physical interaction of VR scenes give more space for the design of virtual avatars. The 3Dization of the image, the smoothness of the action, the closer correspondence between the avatar and the real world, and even the multiple experiences of vision, hearing, and touch have more possibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the creation of virtual identities allows players to be deeply bonded with the game through digital assets, helping the game achieve breakthroughs in user retention. Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said that identity, as one of the eight characteristics of the metaverse, can be regarded as an evolved version of the online identity in current games, and can represent players in a more creative and realistic way through avatars and other methods. In the metaverse game world, the importance of in-game identity and customization options is increasingly prominent. Players will have permanent digital identities and personalized virtual images. Through social activities in the game with virtual identities, they can obtain matching digital assets or custom assets, such as virtual land, houses, works of art, and pets, to achieve an immersive experience similar to the real world.</p>
<p>The self-expression of virtual identity is not only the continuous expansion of personalized images. With the rise of the emerging concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), people will interact in the digital world with the same freedom and trust capabilities as in the real world. The avatar is no longer just a mapping of self-awareness, but is more likely to become one of the roles in real life.</p>

    <title>Is Falling in Love with Paper People Just a Daydream The Immersive Experience of Dating Sims</title>
    <url>/2022/08/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20220812_28584_1036883/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220812/28584_1036883.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the expansion of the female gaming market, female-oriented dating sims have also become a battleground for major manufacturers. However, judging from the data, although there are many newly launched female-oriented dating mobile games, their market performance has declined very quickly. Taking five female-oriented mobile games of the two-dimensional and mixed styles launched in 2021 as an example, compared with the first month’s revenue, the revenue in March 2022 decreased by an average of 85%. It can be seen that not all games have truly touched female players. To provide players with an immersive dating experience and break through the homogenization of the category, it is inseparable from the research on the psychology of female players in dating games.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience"></a>1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience</h2><p>The main reason why dating games are so popular with players is that they create a highly immersive virtual world for players, where players are psychologically satisfied and unconsciously bring their fantasies and emotions from real life into the virtual game.</p>
<h3 id="Ideal-Self"><a href="#Ideal-Self" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Self"></a>Ideal Self</h3><p>In reality, we always have some dissatisfaction with ourselves. Sometimes we wish we could be more charming and successfully pursue the person we like; sometimes we wish we could be braver and say no to a black-hearted boss. The game world gives us such an opportunity to become our ideal self: you can become a popular figure in school, or you can firmly engage in the career you love.</p>
<p>For example, in the dating game <em>Starry☆Sky</em>, released in Japan years ago, the heroine Tsukiko Yahisa is set as the only girl in the school and serves as the secretary of the student council, and is sought after by many people. This slightly “Mary Sue” setting, although very different from real life, satisfies the player’s fantasy to a certain extent: good looks, loved by those around her, and also has the beautiful qualities of bravery and independence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F938ef26a-1e7f-42b6-ae5e-c7c12d0e3238.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Similar settings are also very common in domestic female-oriented dating games. In <em>For All Time</em>, the heroine is an excellent cartoonist who accidentally travels to the world of her own comics and adventures with familiar characters. During the game, the player obtains a new identity (cartoonist, etc.), and also develops a deeper understanding and identification with this identity as the story progresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F3aed829e-0443-4784-93ad-7c36906c808b.png/size/"></p>
<p>From a psychological point of view, self-identity is formed by the interaction between the individual and the real world. However, in dating games, players can easily switch between real life and the virtual world to improve their self-identity. At the same time, the identity experience given to players by the virtual world is often far from the real self, but closer to the ideal self. Players can find a shadow of themselves in the game, and they long to be this character and accomplish many things that cannot be done in real life. In terms of appearance, the characters in the game have ideal figures and beautiful faces; in terms of personality, the fantasy plot like a novel, and the character’s strength and independence in the face of difficulties, are all their projections of the ideal self, satisfying the player’s need for self-worth realization.</p>
<h3 id="Deep-Seated-Motivation"><a href="#Deep-Seated-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Deep-Seated Motivation"></a>Deep-Seated Motivation</h3><p>Strong emotional experience is an important reason for immersion. Browsing the Weibo comments of dating games, we can always see players loudly confessing, “Please marry me quickly, don’t make me beg you on my knees”, “Husband, how can I live without you”, this kind of emotional experience is actually strongly related to the player’s game motivation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F7916d6f8-d8f1-4b78-ac6d-77c22b11c281.png/size/"></p>
<p>After conducting a questionnaire survey of 612 female-oriented game players and semi-structured interviews with 15 players, researchers found that for positive emotions, external motivation (game sound, picture, plot, color) has a greater impact than internal motivation (social interaction, entertainment, learning, etc.). Both motivations have a significant positive correlation with positive emotions. The stronger the motivation, the more obvious the player’s positive emotional experience of the game. In contrast, for negative emotions, the stronger the external motivation, the lower the negative emotions; the stronger the internal motivation, the higher the negative emotions.</p>
<p>Specifically, if we see a player on the forum who is angry, anxious, and frustrated because of a female-oriented game, she is more likely to be an intrinsically motivated player who prefers to gain knowledge, relieve stress, make friends, and enjoy the pleasure of completing achievements through the game. And if it is a player who feels happy and satisfied in the game, then he may be driven by both internal and external motivations. He not only likes to gain knowledge and relieve stress through the game, but also appreciates the game’s graphics, art, music and other designs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fb6ae9394-b8f9-4625-ac5a-ee35e0a8ecd7.png/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, it is also worth paying attention to by industry professionals to better awaken players’ motivation to play during the operation stage.</p>
<h3 id="Flow-Theory"><a href="#Flow-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Flow Theory"></a>Flow Theory</h3><p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as a feeling of total engagement in an activity. Flow is often accompanied by high excitement and fulfillment. Activities that produce a flow state often have the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Activities we tend to engage in</li>
<li>Activities we will focus on</li>
<li>Activities with clear goals</li>
<li>Activities with immediate feedback</li>
<li>We have a sense of control over this activity</li>
<li>Our worries disappear when engaging in the activity</li>
<li>Subjective sense of time changes - for example, you can engage in a long time without feeling the passage of tim.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F25174532-0794-4b05-9c5e-a3048d6f864d.png/size/"></p>
<p>In dating games, players often feel the passage of time without noticing it because they appreciate the handsome cards and charming voices of NPCs. This state is the flow state in psychology.</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding the conditions for the generation of the flow state, designing the game accordingly, and enabling players to achieve the flow state in the game is also an important step in creating an immersive experience.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?"></a>2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?</h2><p>So, after understanding the player’s psychological mechanism, how should game developers build this immersive experience?</p>
<h3 id="Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth"><a href="#Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Focus on Player Self-Worth"></a>Focus on Player Self-Worth</h3><p>Aggregate and analyze big data before game production, and put game settings that meet the psychological needs of modern women into the game, for example, players can independently choose “dating objects” and will also have a unique identity to realize self-worth. During the game, players invisibly feel the cultural content it contains - women’s freedom of marriage, economic independence, etc.</p>
<p>Such female-oriented games act as disseminators of feminist culture, returning the feminist ideas obtained from big data analysis to the target users, forming a cultural dissemination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F06a9466c-d703-4f11-bf88-e749be665415.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Awaken-Player-Motivation"><a href="#Awaken-Player-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Awaken Player Motivation"></a>Awaken Player Motivation</h3><p>In terms of awakening external motivation, excellent graphics and well-known voice acting teams are great bonuses. In addition, female-oriented games can focus more on male NPCs in the setting of scenes. Even if there are scenes where the heroine appears, the heroine is also popularized from the characteristics, so that more players can substitute themselves. This type of game also does its best to create this first-person perspective in the text, and rarely personalizes the heroine. Even in some games, the heroine has different personalities when facing different male NPCs.</p>
<p>Such an “unconscious” shaping of female characters makes the same plot a unique personal “experience” for the player, that is, through the different psychological experiences of the player, the game becomes personalized and customized. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F513188f3-5fc7-48a4-9f11-9bed16508803.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to awakening external motivation, designers can also start from awakening internal motivation to make female users feel “empathy”. For example, in <em>For All Time</em>, players can interact with NPCs using virtual messages. In addition, sending emojis, making phone calls, dating, and other behaviors add a strong “sense of reality” to the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F4b069842-17f0-4062-9562-b648f065947b.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Create-a-Flow-State"><a href="#Create-a-Flow-State" class="headerlink" title="Create a Flow State"></a>Create a Flow State</h3><p>For players to truly enjoy the game, they need to fully substitute themselves into the game characters and participate in the game. When they are fully immersed in it, they will temporarily forget the current time and space and enter the world presented by the game, that is, reach a flow state. In dating games, some clever designs can also help create a flow experience:</p>
<p>In terms of goal setting, improve the player’s clarity of goals and control over the game. For example, the illustration system can help players clearly understand what their goals are and how many achievements they have achieved now. Ungained card sets can also prompt players what else they can do to better achieve their goals and improve their sense of control over the game.</p>
<p>In terms of emotional design, dialogue and voice acting are used to assist in the shaping of characters and the experience of the plot. For example, voice acting is not only reflected in the dialogue in the plot, but also used in various aspects of the player experience, such as the New Year greetings on the login interface, the statements around the birthday theme on the event interface, etc., incorporating emotions into the peripheral systems, making the immersive experience more integrated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fce3ebeec-13ba-4045-8264-41ba5eb336a0.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In general, there are still infinite possibilities for the research on the immersion of female-oriented games: VR technology makes lovers within reach; the metaverse completely connects the real world and the online world; high technology may allow players to truly embrace “paper people” in the future. Gradually upgrading the immersive experience is also the common expectation of players and designers.</p>

    <title>What Makes Gamified Fitness Retain Players? - A Perspective from Ring Fit Adventure</title>
    <url>/2022/03/01/netease-ux-articles/news_20220812_28584_1037022/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220812/28584_1037022.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-About-Fitness-Games"><a href="#1-About-Fitness-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. About Fitness Games"></a>1. About Fitness Games</h2><p>Fitness games usually refer to a type of game and exercise method that combines exercise and gaming. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1980s, when gaming giant Atari was studying how to help players exercise through games. Their solution was to combine Atari’s home console with an exercise bike, but unfortunately this product ultimately failed. In the following decades, many companies tried to launch devices that combined exercise with entertainment. In 2006, Nintendo’s Wii console began to popularize the concept of “fitness games”, and this type of game became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is one of the most successful examples.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-Content-Attracts-Players-in-the-Early-Stage"><a href="#2-What-Content-Attracts-Players-in-the-Early-Stage" class="headerlink" title="2. What Content Attracts Players in the Early Stage?"></a>2. What Content Attracts Players in the Early Stage?</h2><h3 id="Changes-in-Visual-Representation"><a href="#Changes-in-Visual-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Changes in Visual Representation"></a>Changes in Visual Representation</h3><p>Traditional fitness is boring and monotonous. Most ordinary people often give up halfway due to lack of self-discipline during the fitness process, and it is difficult to achieve the purpose of fitness. The emergence of fitness games is to solve the problem of fitness being boring. However, most fitness games do not integrate exercise and gaming well. For example, in <em>Fitness Boxing</em>, players need to complete corresponding boxing actions according to the instructions of the coach in the game, and the system will judge according to the accuracy of the actions. In the game, the visual representation of each fitness action is still the action itself, which is still presented in the form of a result. <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is more like a software that uses motion sensing to assist fitness. It does not fundamentally improve the player’s boring experience in the fitness process.</p>
<p>But in <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, the visual representation of fitness actions in real life has been changed in the game. Fitness actions are no longer the result, but a means. Players need to perform different fitness actions to achieve different presentation effects. For example, in Adventure mode, the fitness action of abdominal pressing is sometimes visually presented as flying; in Casual mode, the squatting action is visually presented as pottery. The change in visual representation makes the fitness process itself interesting, and the diverse forms of representation in the game further stimulate players to experience other game (fitness) content.</p>

Why Can Players Persist in Playing?</h2><h3 id="RPG-Game-Framework"><a href="#RPG-Game-Framework" class="headerlink" title="RPG Game Framework"></a>RPG Game Framework</h3><p>In addition to the changes in visual effects, the more important innovation of <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> lies in the change of its game form. The Adventure mode, which is the core of the <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> game, builds a framework for an RPG game. It integrates exercise into the game, achieving a balance between fitness and gameplay. The game follows the consistent monster-fighting and leveling-up mode of RPGs. The protagonist needs to embark on an adventure with his Ring-Con, defeat all the enemies encountered along the way, and defeat the final BOSS. The game incorporates common RPG game elements such as gold collection, monster fighting and leveling up, skill talents, equipment and armor, side quests, and so on. Thus, fitness is no longer the player’s only motivation, and the continuous growth of the game character also drives players to continue to experience the game. The two motivations complement each other, which allows players to achieve the purpose of fitness while enjoying the fun of the game. On the other hand, part of the player’s attention will be diverted from the fitness itself to the process of fighting monsters and leveling up, which to a certain extent helps players ignore the fatigue and boredom of fitness, and ultimately translates into longer fitness time and better exercise results.</p>

<h3 id="Concrete-Instant-Feedback"><a href="#Concrete-Instant-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Concrete Instant Feedback"></a>Concrete Instant Feedback</h3><p>During the fitness process, two parts of the character played by the player will show a “burning” special effect. The first part is the hair. The size of the burning flame of the hair corresponds to the accuracy of the player’s fitness movements; the second burning part is the body part that is actually used for each fitness movement, and the name of the corresponding body part will also be marked on the screen. First of all, when players do local fitness exercises, the burning special effects will give players the illusion that a certain body part is burning fat. When players form a psychological hint of burning fat, players will subconsciously correct and improve their movements in order to maximize the fat burning effect (the degree of hair burning). Similar psychological cues include the animation of abdominal strength. When the player is charging up, the beer belly will gradually transform into eight-pack abs. At the same time, when the player is defending against the boss’s attack, the abdominal muscle shield will also change with the size of the player’s strength. When players subconsciously regard their abdomen as the huge abdominal muscle shield in front of them, players will be motivated by this to continue to squeeze their abdomen involuntarily. The purpose of the above two designs is actually to present the “invisible” instant benefits of fitness in reality to the player in the most intuitive way, so as to maximize the player’s motivation in the fitness process.</p>

Why Don’t Players Get Tired of Playing?</h2><h3 id="Evolution-of-the-Same-Action-Gameplay"><a href="#Evolution-of-the-Same-Action-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="Evolution of the Same Action Gameplay"></a>Evolution of the Same Action Gameplay</h3><p>In the actual fitness scene, people generally achieve the purpose of exercising a certain part by repeatedly completing a set of actions. However, <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, through continuous innovation in gameplay, makes the same actions no longer repetitive and monotonous, which minimizes the boring experience that players need to endure when repeating a single fitness action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F350ae499-216d-4dc6-ae09-11c4a659420f.png/size/" alt="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nie.res.netease.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;pic&#x2F;20220812&#x2F;350ae499-216d-4dc6-ae09-11c4a659420f.png"></p>
<p>Take the squat as an example. At the beginning of the game, squats are used to trigger the ejection switch, and players only need to complete the simplest squat action. Later, the game introduced a switch that needs to be continuously squatted to trigger, which has additional requirements on the basic squat action. Then, the game added a spring mechanism, the effect of which is to bounce higher and higher, which requires players to perform multiple squats. Subsequently, squats evolved from springs to swings. Swings are in groups of six squats, and the rhythm is emphasized during the process, requiring players to complete them continuously. In addition, squats have also evolved into a rail car gameplay, where players need to control the rail car through squats, moving forward a little with each squat. If they encounter an uphill, players need to squat quickly and continuously, which also exercises the player’s endurance and explosive power. A simple squat mechanism has evolved all the way in terms of gameplay. In terms of fitness experience, it not only meets the players’ fitness needs for repeated exercise of the squat action, but also the gradually increasing difficulty of the gameplay enables players to master the skills and essentials of squatting. In terms of gaming experience, the form of presentation and gameplay of squats in the game are constantly changing; even if players are doing repetitive fitness movements, they can still feel a sense of freshness.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Fitness itself is a time-consuming, weak-feedback, monotonous and painful exercise. Not only do you have to endure the boring process, but also the torment of fatigue. It takes a long time for people to see results. In contrast, the game itself is a culture based on entertainment, and one of the biggest features is strong feedback. <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is trying to amplify these two parts. In the early stage, players will be mainly attracted by the novel visual representation. The fitness actions in reality are presented in a gamified way, so that players can perceive the fun in the fitness process. At the same time, the “invisible” instant benefits of fitness in reality are presented to the player in the most intuitive way, maximizing the player’s motivation in the fitness process. When players experience for a period of time and perceive the core fun of RPG games, fitness itself is no longer the only motivation for players to continue to experience. Finally, the continuous evolution of the same fitness action gameplay not only meets the basic needs of players for increasing fitness difficulty, but also minimizes the boring experience that players need to endure when repeating a single action. The continuous provision of freshness and fun in terms of gameplay content ultimately drives players to continue to experience the game (fitness).</p>

    <title>May We All Be Blessed With Longevity, And Share The Beauty of the Moon Though Thousands of Miles Apart The Happy Ending in Games</title>
    <url>/2022/09/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20220913_28584_1042133/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220913/28584_1042133.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the Mid-Autumn Festival again, one of China’s four traditional festivals, and it also represents reunion. Throughout history, people have often used the “waxing and waning of the moon” to contrast “joys and sorrows, partings and reunions.” Su Shi’s “Prelude to Water Melody” uses the line “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” to give the Mid-Autumn Festival a unique romance and the theme of expecting reunion.  Even today, the main folk activities of the Mid-Autumn Festival still revolve around the theme of “reunion.” What does a happy ending look like in games? And why do players always crave a happy ending?</p>
<h2 id="1-Happy-Ending-HE-or-Bad-Ending-BE"><a href="#1-Happy-Ending-HE-or-Bad-Ending-BE" class="headerlink" title="1. Happy Ending (HE) or Bad Ending (BE)?"></a>1. Happy Ending (HE) or Bad Ending (BE)?</h2><p>When we browse Weibo (Chinese Twitter), we can always see many trending topics about popular dramas, usually in the format of “#XXX reveals that the ending of XX is HE#.” The ending of every popular film and television work triggers huge discussions, and it seems that the audience’s demand for HE (Happy Ending) is becoming stronger and stronger. When “Love Between Fairy and Devil” was broadcast, many fans were very concerned about whether “Dongfang Qingcang” and “Little Orchid” could have an HE, and they were relieved only after seeing the two together in the finale.</p>
<p>Although the terms HE and BE that we see now often appear in film and television dramas, these abbreviations actually originated from the gaming circle, especially in AVG games with multiple endings and multiple branches. However, many 3A masterpieces now also provide different plot choices. For example, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, different feedback from each dialogue of the protagonist will open different branch plots, which in turn will affect different endings. Of course, interactive movie games are more typical. For example, in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, the ending of the story depends entirely on the player’s choices, and there are countless branch plots in the middle. It is difficult for players to repeatedly play the same ending, which also dilutes the concept of HE and BE. Now it is difficult to define the different endings of a game with the traditional binary opposition definition, just like “Tian Long Ba Bu” (Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils), where “everyone is wronged, and all who are affectionate are sinful.” The labels of HE&#x2F;BE are now difficult to use to summarize the ending of a game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fc44dfd52-588d-4aad-8591-58a1cefc025f.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>AVG games are still sought after by many players</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the more ancient and once-popular text adventure games, HE and BE were still hot topics that players would always pay attention to. Even in addition to HE and BE, text adventure game enthusiasts would also discuss TE (True End) and NE (Normal End), but at present, these two labels are obviously only applicable to the game field. TE is the so-called “true ending,” which is a real ending that players believe is superior to other endings. It often requires players to complete all other endings before they have the opportunity to unlock TE, and other endings will automatically “degenerate” to NE.</p>
<p>As an extension of text, in the field of online literature, HB&#x2F;BE even directly form a label-based screening process. If it is BE, there will be a “risk warning” before reading. Of course, readers can also filter it out in advance, so that they can read it clearly.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?"></a>2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?</h2><p>Returning to the topic of games, although multiple endings have now become the choice of many games, most mainstream games still have linear plots, and it is not difficult to list the happy endings in games.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>It Takes Two</em> is not complicated.  It roughly goes: “In the game, the little girl hears that her parents have decided to divorce, and she is heartbroken and prays to Dr. Hakim that they will not separate. With the help of the doctor and his guidance, the souls of the parents are transferred to two dolls, and they reluctantly begin an adventure in the magical world, trying to return to their original bodies. The two experience various hardships and dangers together, and after taking four lessons from Dr. Hakim, they gradually find their original sincere feelings and decide not to separate. So the spell is broken, and the family of three lives happily ever after.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F2f5be6af-403e-4186-8ef6-fa2d121e1741.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Mending a broken mirror is the biggest theme of the plot of “It Takes Two”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another masterpiece ported to PC, <em>Days Gone</em>, tells a story in the apocalypse. Facing the zombie siege, the protagonist and his brother and girlfriend, the three of them flee together. The girlfriend and brother are seriously injured, and the rescue helicopter that is about to take off cannot carry three people. In the end, the protagonist and his brother choose to stay, and the girlfriend successfully boards the rescue helicopter.</p>
<p>After the two escaped, they found the medical camp where the helicopter landed, but found that it had already been looted by zombies. Although they did not find the girlfriend’s body, the protagonist desperately believed that she had passed away, and felt self-blame and regret for it. Until one day, he accidentally discovered the possibility of his girlfriend’s miraculous survival, and then drove north, going through all kinds of hardships, and finally reunited with his girlfriend. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb5369fcc-0fe1-493a-849a-587e1a3175b2.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p>*The protagonist is very sure that his girlfriend is dead and has erected a monument for her. </p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F1e04c492-f2dc-478b-b14d-518c9248a66b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The protagonist reunites with his girlfriend at the end</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The reason for giving examples of these two games, in addition to their happy endings, is another characteristic, that is, they have all experienced the plot of “loss and recovery,” experiencing ups and downs, rather than being smooth from beginning to end. Such a plot setting often gives players a more gratifying feeling and releases more positive signals.</p>
<p>A psychological counseling supervisor once mentioned that when members of a mutual aid group shared their experiences of loss and recovery, some positive signals were often released along with them. For example, a member found a wallet that had been lost a long time ago in an unexpected place before participating in the group activity, so he suddenly said during the sharing that he felt he had the energy to clean up the house, and everything was developing in a good direction. This is a phenomenon of synchronicity in analytical psychology. When something happens internally, the external world also presents similar signals to us in some way.</p>
<h2 id="3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending"><a href="#3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending" class="headerlink" title="3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?"></a>3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?</h2><p>In fact, the title reveals everything. “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” is preceded by “People have joys and sorrows, partings and reunions; the moon waxes and wanes, is bright or dim: these things have always been this way since time immemorial (人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全 - rén yǒu bēi huān lí hé, yuè yǒu yīn qíng yuán quē, cǐ shì gǔ nán quán)”.  Games, like movies, are immersive experiences. Players will put themselves into the role and have empathy.</p>
<p>You can try to recall the Spring Festival of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly in an unimaginable way, and you and I around you, and even the entire society, experienced a huge psychological shock. Seeing various negative emotions on the Internet, many people will have a feeling of discomfort, which we call “empathic exhaustion.”</p>
<p>An excellent game can create a traversal game space with high degrees of freedom and more options, providing players with a very in-depth interactive experience from the structure and mechanism. But what really attracts players to continue playing is the story that integrates traversal selection and interactive narrative techniques, as well as the story content that players personally participate in telling. In the immersive plot of about 10-20 hours, we experience everything that the game characters experience. If we are really allowed to repeatedly lose one partner after another, and repeat one BE after another, we will be in a state of intense mental fatigue: once we start to walk into the pain of others, it is difficult to stop continuing to feel the pain, and it is also difficult to get out of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fc3ba16d7-bb91-40be-86fe-637b7b9f4975.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The author’s mental state was also affected by empathy when experiencing “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From a social perspective, in fact, many people in real life are engaged in “professional helping” industries, such as doctors, psychological counselors, etc. They often need to undergo very professional related training before they can be licensed to work. For example, psychological counselors need to follow supervisors to handle a large number of cases, and colleagues also need to discuss regularly with each other to avoid empathic exhaustion caused by trying to establish emotional connections with patients. And with the deepening of medical training, in many cases, their ability to empathize with patients will decrease, and even empathy钝化 (dùnhuà, blunting) will occur. Research also shows that compared with practitioners in the music, science, and finance industries, professional helpers are more likely to have substance abuse problems, which means… they also collapse.</p>
<p>But players will not undergo any professional training. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Abby’s use of a golf club to torture and kill Joel made many players feel quite uncomfortable. In the previous work, players spent a lot of time feeling and believing in two pitiful people who lost their families. Even if there is no blood relationship between the two, they can support each other like a real father and daughter, fighting against the entire wasteland world. But in the sequel, Joel is brutally killed, and even many people are unbelievable when they play this plot. Unlike the general film and television drama bridges where the protagonist is shot or falls off a cliff and there is still a chance, Joel, who was hit multiple times on the head with a golf club, is completely offline and cannot be saved. Many players also said that no matter which perspective they substitute, this ending is ultimately difficult to accept.</p>
<p>After a huge disaster, we can easily distinguish who are firefighters and police officers from the crowd - because they are the only ones who rush to the scene when everyone else is staying away from the disaster scene. But as players of ordinary characters, we just want to stay away from the traumatic experience scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F3419396a-18de-4ad0-88aa-cdf283102176.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The duo in Part 1 experienced life and death in Part 2</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So, rather than saying why we want to see a happy ending, it’s better to say that players don’t want to see others suffering during a long period of immersion. To put it simply, players don’t want to be sad, players don’t want to be upset. Social psychology has learned a beautiful world expectation, which roughly means that in order to give the whole world a sense of meaning, people tend to believe that the world is beautiful. That being the case, why embrace a miserable world?</p>

    <title>Capturing the Myriad Thoughts of Players - Designing with Emotion</title>
    <url>/2022/09/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20220913_28584_1042134/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220913/28584_1042134.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Video games are called interactive art. Players need to integrate themselves into the game world to savor the scenes created by the developers and the stories they write. However, it is not easy to allow players to smoothly solve the puzzles set by the developers without them realizing that they are being restricted by the game’s guidance.</p>
<p>To achieve this, it is first necessary to clarify “what kind of experience” you want to give the players. Only by guiding the direction with this can you accurately create or combine mechanisms that better express the essence of the work. However, “gameplay”, “mechanisms”, and “systems” all these game elements will eventually be mapped to the player’s emotional experience, which is why game experience design starts with emotional experience.</p>
<p>People may forget what someone said, but they will never forget how someone made them feel. Therefore, mobilizing emotions will naturally make people remember that feeling. This is the importance of emotional experience, as the saying goes, “sentimentality” is human nature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb6edf132-623b-4a29-9dad-6b662fe16090.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Speaking of this, I’m sure everyone will have doubts: then why don’t players choose the smooth and linear enjoyment of movies, but instead spend energy to challenge and even be a little self-abusive in games? This is precisely because games can bring players unique emotional experiences: a sense of choice, freedom, responsibility, and achievement, etc. These experiences are difficult to obtain through movies or other means.</p>
<h2 id="1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings"><a href="#1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings"></a>1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings</h2><p>Before discussing how to influence players’ emotional experience through design, we need to distinguish between two concepts: emotion and feeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> It is the short-term, instinctive, and impulsive feeling that the player produces. For example, sudden scares in horror games, the surprise of getting a good draw in gacha games, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Feeling:</strong> It is a social, advanced, delicate, and lasting feeling, which is a summary and sublimation based on emotions. For example, you will cry because of the departure of a character in the game, and you will be shocked by the ending of the game for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of individual psychological development, emotions appear earlier, while feelings appear later. Emotions are situational and temporary; feelings are profound and stable. After understanding the concepts of the two, we find that changes in players’ emotions can influence and give rise to different feelings, thereby affecting subsequent experiences and feelings. So how to make reasonable use of players’ emotions has become an important part of emotional experience design.</p>
<h2 id="2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions"><a href="#2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions"></a>2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions</h2><p>The process in which you perceive various influencing factors in the game and trigger emotional fermentation in your heart is the emotional experience, and this process is also constantly affected by “interaction”. The main factors that affect players’ emotions in the game include the following aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Frequency"><a href="#Interaction-Frequency" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Frequency"></a>Interaction Frequency</h3><p>Generally speaking, the higher the frequency of interaction, the more intense the player’s emotions. For example, in a shooting game, players need to simultaneously hold down the keyboard to adjust the position, move the mouse to control the direction, and click the mouse to aim and shoot. The interaction frequency required in the game is very high, and the player’s emotions are prone to be in a more excited and nervous state. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fe41cb8a5-18cf-478d-b237-67a00711661b.gif/size/"></p>
<p>In some puzzle games, it is often necessary to reduce the interaction frequency so that players can switch from tense emotions to relaxed emotions that are conducive to thinking, and reduce the interference and interruption of players’ thoughts with less present interaction methods.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Feedback"><a href="#Interaction-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Feedback"></a>Interaction Feedback</h3><p>Interaction feedback refers to the perceptual feedback that players instantly obtain after performing interactive operations. Feedback is an important part of the interaction process. Only when players receive obvious and sufficient multi-dimensional feedback will they think that the current interaction is meaningful, and the emotions triggered by the interaction will be more real. Conversely, if you don’t want players to perform a certain interactive behavior, just don’t give them any feedback. For example, in a shooting game, if the designer does not allow players to harm their teammates, players will not receive any feedback when they hit their teammates in battle.</p>
<h3 id="Real-time-Performance"><a href="#Real-time-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Real-time Performance"></a>Real-time Performance</h3><p>Real-time performance refers to the visual, auditory, tactile, and other information that players obtain in real time during the game, regardless of whether they interact or not. They can all bring various emotional experiences to players in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In visual performance, different colors (red feels passionate, blue feels calm), different shapes (circles feel gentle, spikes feel dangerous), different shots (looking up feels oppressive, shaking feels uneasy), etc. will make players have different emotions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In auditory performance, different rhythms, instruments, pitches, etc. will also bring different emotions to players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In tactile performance, the maximum level of tactile performance we can achieve so far is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F64eab8b2-c193-4a74-9467-1a143e929808.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation"><a href="#Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation"></a>Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation</h3><p>To mobilize players’ tension in competitive and action games, a moment is usually created - in this moment, players must complete complex operations accurately and without error to win. For example, dodging and parrying when players fight bosses in the <em>God of War</em> series; players in <em>Dota</em> reverse the situation and win the victory through perfect cooperation with teammates. In these moments, the player’s tension is constantly stimulated, and the emotions are pulled to the highest point and then released like a floodgate at the moment of victory. This pleasure of emotional release is “addictive”. </p>

<p>Tension can be used, and other emotions can also be used. For example, in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, under the guidance of the plot, players, as members of Task Force 141, fight side by side with their teammates in order to complete the mission of their trusted superior, Shepherd. The repeated battles side by side deepen the friendship between the players and their teammates. In the conversations and work with the teammates, players will recognize the unique personality of each teammate, which deepens the players’ cognitive depth of the NPCs.</p>
<p>But in the later missions, the commander of Task Force 141, Shepherd, betrayed them and mercilessly killed or indirectly harmed the team members. All these changes will make players feel shocked, unbelievable, angry, sad, and broken down. The hatred for Commander Shepherd is high. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>The unfortunate “Ghost” and “Roach” are thrown into a pit and burned together.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is this plot that makes players remember the character “Ghost” who is not the protagonist. Even today, six years later, there are still a large number of players who feel sorry for the character “Ghost”, and its related peripheral products are in short supply.</p>
<h3 id="Drive-Emotions-with-Choices"><a href="#Drive-Emotions-with-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Drive Emotions with Choices"></a>Drive Emotions with Choices</h3><p>The above examples all use the simple and strong stimulation of players to generate rapid emotional fluctuations. However, sometimes we want some practices that are slower to take effect but have a longer-lasting impact. At this time, we can try to impact the players’ self-awareness to generate emotional fluctuations. There is a theory in psychology called self-discrepancy theory, which divides everyone’s cognition of themselves into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual self:</strong> Objective and true evaluation of oneself</li>
<li><strong>Ought self:</strong> Feeling that you should do those things, this is your obligation (such as calling 119 when you see a fire)</li>
<li><strong>Ideal self:</strong> What you would do in your ideal self (such as doing charity)</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a gap between the actual self and the ought self, you will feel that you have not fulfilled your responsibilities and obligations, and then you will have emotions such as guilt and shame. The most classic example is the “moral dilemma”. Taking <em>The Witcher 3</em> as an example, in the game, facing a woman who is heartbroken by the loss of her child, orphans who are suffering from hunger and cold, innocent villagers, and a wealthy but childless baron, no matter how the player chooses, they cannot save everyone. At this time, the player will inevitably feel the gap between the actual self and the ought self, and then generate the above emotions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F0425ab60-ce7a-4430-bc61-dd5c697a844b.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The classic Bloody Baron quest in “The Witcher 3”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another classic case is <em>This War of Mine</em>. There is no difficulty option in this game. The difficulty of clearing the game is more based on the player’s code of conduct. Players can choose the human mode: take in every defector, help everyone who asks for help, don’t take a needle or thread from the masses… But the consequence of this is often to increase the difficulty of clearing the game, and eventually end in tragedy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Ff6ab6d9d-4ee6-4488-80a1-49acd68ca4c4.png/size/"></p>
<p>The lack of supplies throughout the game forces players to choose “violent” methods to solve problems. When players choose to abandon moral constraints and have the mentality of “it’s just a game” and “the game must be cleared”, the game also becomes “easy”. So you break into the mansion of the old couple and loot their supplies, because you are about to run out of food; you start to sneak attack other survivors in the ruins and take their weapons and bullets, because you need weapons to protect yourself; you will decisively abandon the injured companion, because the soldiers next door are about to find this place; you will keep the child who came to ask for medicine out of the door, because only these supplies are left. But in fact, making these decisions is not easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Febd12d6b-9526-4f82-930a-5b5d2994a575.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the face of such complex emotions, it is often difficult for people to make decisions. The reason why it is difficult is because people’s emotions are deeply touched and they experience the difficulty of choice. Therefore, designing complex emotional experiences, grasping the complex emotional factors in people’s hearts, and creating a difficult situation are very important in game design.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when there is a gap between the actual self and the ideal self, people tend to have emotions such as frustration and disappointment towards themselves. These emotions are usually not strong, because people often fail to reach their ideal self. After these emotions often appear, they will also begin to become numb.</p>
<p>So is the gap between the actual self and the ideal self not able to be used to generate strong emotions? Of course not, because conversely, once this gap is crossed and the ideal self is reached, people will feel great joy, satisfaction, and pride. These powerful and very positive emotions will also be addictive. “The bigger the gap crossed, the greater the emotional fluctuation”.</p>
<h3 id="Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion"><a href="#Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Sublimate Experience with Emotion"></a>Sublimate Experience with Emotion</h3><p>So now the question is how to create this huge gap?</p>
<p>Self-sacrifice is a good way. Regarding self-sacrifice, the writer Somerset Maugham has a wonderful description in <em>The Razor’s Edge</em>: “Self-sacrifice is an overwhelming emotion. Even lust and hunger are insignificant compared to it. It makes people make the highest evaluation of their personality and drives people to destruction. It can be worthwhile, or it can be worthless. No wine is so intoxicating, no love is so destructive, and no sin is so irresistible. When sacrificing oneself, one instantly becomes greater than God.”</p>
<p>The most amazing game that incorporates “self-sacrifice” and allows players to complete the leap of the ideal self is <em>Nier: Automata</em>. In the ending of <em>Nier: Automata</em>, the task difficulty of the player fighting the production team is designed to be very large. But when the player is about to be shot down, they will see messages from all players in the world, encouraging you to persevere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb7c86e61-363f-4145-97a3-7932d2f1351a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Then, you find that your plane is protected by 6 wingmen. Each plane is a player’s save file. Being shot down means that the save file is lost. In this process, you will feel the kindness from all over the world. So many players are willing to sacrifice their save files just to block a bullet for a stranger. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F58a1fe74-fba6-489c-98ab-a4531b40e9ea.png/size/"></p>
<p>After clearing the game, the game also gives players the opportunity to sacrifice themselves, but it is not a simple and direct option. This design is particularly clever. First, it allows players to leave messages, just like they were encouraged before, to encourage other players who are in a hard battle, immediately allowing players to complete the role transition from the helped to the helper. Then step by step, through a series of questions, the meaning of the player’s self-sacrifice is enhanced.</p>
<p>“Are you going to save the weak?” “Are you sure you want to use all your data to save someone you don’t know?” “That person may be someone you hate, are you still willing to do this?” “The chapters and functions you have worked so hard to unlock will also be unavailable, are you still willing to do this?” “In fact, you may not be thanked for doing this, you may be seen as hypocritical, are you still willing to do this?” Every time the player clicks [Yes], they reach an ideal self. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F4c65af59-145e-4d66-9d27-227eba7ac39a.png/size/"></p>
<p>This ending always controls the player’s emotions, appropriately uses the player’s “self-sacrifice” emotions, makes the player feel “participating in a great cause”, and thus generates a high evaluation of their own morality, reaching the “ideal self” in their heart, and completely deepening the experience of the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Designers create a real game world through various methods. The purpose of various gameplay, systems, and level settings is also to allow players to better immerse themselves in it, satisfy players’ various fantasies in real society, play the role of a hero to kill dragons, and play the role of a knight to save the world. Everything is to allow players to feel the beauty of the virtual world, gradually gain self-identification, emotional catharsis, and communication and resonance with others in the process of experiencing the game.</p>

    <title>Clocking In In The Virtual World Game Check-In System Experience Design</title>
    <url>/2022/09/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20220916_28584_1042734/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220916/28584_1042734.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When it comes to checking in, you must be familiar with it. From reporting to school as a child to clocking in at work now, checking in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. In games, we can often see this delightful and worrying check-in design.</p>
<p>We hope to get corresponding rewards through check-ins, but too many check-ins will make us feel bored. And check-ins do have a magical attraction for us. To exaggerate, as long as the “check-in” function is added, we will unconsciously check in to receive rewards. Nowadays, the “addictive” effect of check-ins has also prompted more games and mobile applications to add this function to their products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Ffb44828e-b915-4989-8afa-7197145bb36f.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Check-in Page in the Game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In game products, check-in means that the player has logged in to the game or participated in a certain activity. It refers to the player’s operation on the game interface at a specific time and conveys to the system that the product has been used. This method improves the user activity and retention rate of the game to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Nowadays, check-in activities have basically become a standard gameplay in every game, especially check-ins during special events or festivals, which play an important role in maintaining high player activity during the event. It is precisely because the check-in system in the game has a strong attraction to players, allowing players to obtain certain rewards after checking in, that makes players dependent on and “addicted” to check-ins.</p>
<p>Although check-ins will also bring an uncomfortable sense of restraint to some players, this sense of restraint is generally replaced by the pleasure of various rewards. Even if some players still cannot accept this method, it is undeniable that the design of the check-in function does have great appeal to players, while maintaining a high level of player activity in the game for a certain period of time, and even attracting some fans who are keen on checking in.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?"></a>1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?</h2><h3 id="Game-Perspective"><a href="#Game-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Game Perspective"></a>Game Perspective</h3><p>For game products, the design of the check-in function mainly serves to increase player activity, improve retention, attract new users, and promote revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Activity:</strong> Through the check-in function, the game allows players to log in to the game every day, increasing player activity in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> The check-in function allows players to form a habit of playing the game through this form, encouraging players to go online and receive rewards as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Attract New Users:</strong> Attracting new users means that players can share socially through check-in tasks, so that the number of players can be increased to a certain extent.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Revenue:</strong> Promoting revenue is to guide players to transform from non-paying players to paying players by differentiating rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Player-Perspective"><a href="#Player-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Player Perspective"></a>Player Perspective</h3><p>From the player’s perspective, the main purpose of players checking in is to obtain certain rewards. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, rewards are mainly divided into material and spiritual rewards.</p>
<p>First, players can get material rewards: that is, players can get game points, prizes, skins, props and a series of rewards that attract them to log in through check-ins. Second, players can get spiritual rewards: that is, the rewards obtained by players through check-ins make them emotionally satisfied (the need to be praised and recognized by others), and self-actualization (such as game rankings, achievement completion, obtaining medals, etc.).</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of whether it is from the game perspective or the player perspective, the check-in design meets the needs of both parties. It can not only meet the deep needs of players for material and spiritual rewards, but also bring high attention, activity and retention rates to the game. Therefore, the importance of designing check-in functions in products is self-evident.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players"><a href="#2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?"></a>2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?</h2><p>After understanding what check-in is and why we should design check-in, we need to discuss why check-in design is so “magical” and makes players fall into the cycle of check-ins. We believe that two points are very important.</p>
<h3 id="Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol"><a href="#Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol" class="headerlink" title="Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol"></a>Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol</h3><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, check-in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. It can be said that check-in has become a “super symbol” implanted in our brains. This forms that as long as it is any check-in design, players will unconsciously click to check in. Because they already have expectations for check-in in their minds, check-in will always have an attraction effect on players.</p>
<h3 id="Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in"><a href="#Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in" class="headerlink" title="Psychological Suggestion of Check-in"></a>Psychological Suggestion of Check-in</h3><p>Check-in behavior is generally considered to be continuous, so after players start checking in, they will tend to complete it continuously. And players have a clear understanding of check-in. If they complete the check-in, they will get rewards. If they continue to complete the check-in, they will get more rewards. This psychological suggestion will drive players to actively complete the check-in. The check-in function first deeply attracts players at the psychological level, and then through different check-in designs in the game, players are driven to complete the check-in by psychological inertia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F15ae2316-890d-4f65-998f-92bbc9ac8dde.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?"></a>3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?</h2><p>Since check-in is so attractive to players, how should the check-in in the game be designed? In order to allow players to continue checking in for a long time and stay in the game, the “addiction” model can be incorporated.</p>
<p>The “addiction model” mainly includes four links: trigger, action, reward, and investment. Through the reward mechanism, it stimulates users to repeatedly start the game, cultivates players’ behavior habits, and makes players dependent on and惯性(guàn xìng - inertia) to the game; at the same time, the characteristic function design further improves the activity and retention of existing players in the game, allowing the check-in function to achieve a win-win situation for the game and players.</p>
<h3 id="Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance"><a href="#Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Trigger Design - Player Guidance"></a>Trigger Design - Player Guidance</h3><p>The game check-in has a guiding effect on players. When guiding players, it is necessary to use triggers to drive players to enter the “addiction” cycle of check-in in the game. Triggers can prompt players to take action and give them psychological hints before the player’s check-in behavior begins.</p>
<p>In the game, it is necessary to establish a more obvious check-in prompt to get the player’s attention and increase the exposure of check-in in the game. The commonly used prompt methods in the game are pop-up windows and non-modal reminders of icons. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, when players enter the game, a modal activity window will pop up to remind players of recent activities and activity check-ins. After entering the game, the icons on the right use bright light flashing to highlight the activities and check-in entrance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F3987c1ce-45ea-41f1-9c63-894670635bd0.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p>At the same time, on the left side of the game lobby, task guidance is used to allow players to view the tasks that can be completed every day and obtain corresponding rewards. The setting of simple tasks not only guides players to familiarize themselves with the gameplay, modes, etc. of the game, but also becomes an important auxiliary function for players to experience the game. At the same time, reducing the difficulty of tasks and the amount of stimulation for players, reducing the burden on players, encouraging players to experience the game, and obtaining corresponding rewards after completing tasks, all make the trigger effective and allow players to enter the next link of the “addiction” model. </p>

<h3 id="Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals"><a href="#Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Behavior Design - Emotional Goals"></a>Behavior Design - Emotional Goals</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Increase player motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A very important goal of check-in design is to influence player emotions and design player behavior. In the check-in process, it is necessary to provide players with a goal, so that players have expectations in their hearts, and hope that they can complete the goal at a certain stage. When players get closer and closer to this goal in the process, their actions will occur faster.</p>
<p>This effect of accelerating player actions through behavior design will have an impact on player emotions. When the player’s current goal is achieved, their motivation will be restored. Therefore, when the player completes the current stage goal, it is necessary to continue to set the next goal to stimulate the player’s emotional goal. In <em>My Dear Farm</em>, players can get a box of furniture by completing 7 days of check-in. In order to get special prizes, players will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the gift package, the rewards will gradually increase, thereby further increasing player motivation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fc09970fd-a8f5-4efa-8fc1-cecfe616d534.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《My Dear Farm》 Check-in Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the player’s check-in cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Another aspect of influencing player emotional goals is to reduce the player’s check-in cost. That is, when players face a large amount of information and choices, they will need more time to think, which will greatly increase the player’s burden and then reduce player emotions. Therefore, in the game, breaking down large goals into small goals that are achieved in stages will reduce the burden on players, increase players’ goal expectations, and enhance players’ phased sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the game divides the days of each month into a target cycle of 7 days (i.e., one week). Players will receive gold chips as a reward for accumulating 7 check-ins. In order to obtain this reward and exchange items in the game, everyone will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the 7-day gift package, the better the gift rewards will be. This effectively stimulates the player’s interest, enhances their check-in motivation, and makes the probability of players breaking their check-in streak lower and lower. </p>

<h3 id="Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior"><a href="#Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior"></a>Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior</h3><p>Players obtain certain rewards through check-ins, which can enhance their check-in motivation. At the same time, the feedback of obtaining rewards reinforces this behavior. Check-in provides players with a new way to obtain game resources. Players only need to maintain loyalty to the game and perform simple check-in operations to obtain corresponding game resources. Of course, the design of rewards should also consider the gradual progress of the process, and it is necessary to meet the different needs of players according to different cycles.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s anniversary celebration interspersed different levels of rewards during the check-in period, fully mobilizing players’ emotions and making them unable to stop once they started checking in. At the same time, they can obtain advanced costumes for new characters during the check-in to guide and strengthen their willingness to experience new characters, and meet the needs of new and old players through other rewards. Even in some games, a complete set of equipment will be broken down into check-in rewards, so that players can continue to complete check-ins to collect the equipment. This method can also stimulate players’ collection needs. </p>

The more players invest in the game, the more they will value check-in. The game can start with investment design and mobilize players’ emotions. As the number of check-ins increases, the number of days players have checked in is displayed, and even a personalized check-in commemorative booklet can be customized for players, so that players have a different kind of emotion for the game.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>A Dream of Jianghu</em>, when a player reaches 666 days of check-in, the game thoughtfully prepares a personalized commemorative booklet for the player, visually displaying the player’s investment in the game. This design brings satisfaction and emotional resonance to the player’s emotional experience, and also makes the player unforgettable about the game. </p>

<h3 id="Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation"><a href="#Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation"></a>Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation</h3><p>In addition to the “addiction” model, attention should also be paid to the characteristic design of check-in. Common check-in activities are designed with regular check-in boards, but long-term presentation in this way will always give people a feeling of fatigue of looking at a calendar, which will cause players to have the burden of completing tasks. Therefore, breaking the conventional design can not only bring players a novel experience, but also highlight the theme of the game or the theme of new activities.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Onmyoji</em>, the design of its check-in interface is presented in the form of daily divination check-in, which is very consistent with the tonality of the game. The way of divination check-in also gives players a novel experience, driving players to unknowingly complete the check-in behavior during the divination process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F58baf0e2-e047-4efd-9284-c07273cb8ee4.png/size/"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the check-in interface of a certain period of activity in <em>Identity V</em>, players can check in by wiping the mirror, and they will also receive corresponding rewards after completing the check-in. In addition to the personalized design of the interface in combination with the game theme, the way of checking in by wiping the mirror is also very novel. At the same time, players will find that every time they wipe the mirror, the tasks in the mirror will change slightly, which hints at the development of the plot and makes players imaginative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fdcbd3439-cd1d-4b17-bbad-7fd7aa85b80e.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Identity V》 Event Check-in Page</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, if the check-in design wants to further attract players, make players develop the habit of logging in to the game every day, and complete the corresponding activity check-ins in the game to obtain rewards, it is necessary to guide players through trigger design, satisfy players’ emotional goals through behavior design, strengthen player behavior through reward design, and arouse player emotional resonance through investment design. And present novel themes with characteristic designs to improve event data.</p>
<p>Although too many check-in designs will make some players feel bored, a good check-in design will definitely not make players feel burdened. As long as the check-in design is integrated with the game and presented in various forms, everything can be used for check-in. If it can make players think of the game unconsciously and develop the habit of opening the game unconsciously, it should be a check-in that players will never forget and love, and it is also a great game that amazes players!</p>

    <title>Seeing is Not Necessarily Believing Optical Illusion Games</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220916/28584_1042741.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The famous printmaker M.C. Escher’s painting “Waterfall” depicts a building that can make a water wheel run forever by relying on a “circulating waterfall.” At first glance, the viewer will feel that the waterfall in the painting is flowing, but upon closer inspection, it will be found that the waterfall in the picture will flow down continuously, but the falling water will flow upstream. This is an optical illusion picture that can be reasonably depicted in two-dimensional space, but cannot actually appear in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1321b0d6-56b4-4ab6-ada8-8c4bfba4d929.jpg/size/" alt="Escher&#39;s famous painting &quot;Waterfall&quot;"></p>
<p>Optical illusions make the viewer’s visual experience contradict normal reasoning, breaking the stereotype of human binary thinking and allowing the viewer’s imagination to break through the boundaries of natural physical laws. In recent years, optical illusion games have captured many players with their unique visual illusions and endless imagination.</p>
<p>In this article, we will mainly introduce three types of visual illusions: impossible spaces, perspective illusions, and Gestalt illusions, and analyze the reasons why optical illusion games attract players.</p>
<h2 id="1-Impossible-Spaces"><a href="#1-Impossible-Spaces" class="headerlink" title="1. Impossible Spaces"></a>1. Impossible Spaces</h2><p>The formation of impossible space utilizes the conversion and alternation of viewpoints, showing three-dimensional forms on a two-dimensional plane, but presenting ambiguous visual effects in the three-dimensional form, causing confusion in space.</p>
<p>The Penrose triangle is a typical impossible figure based on impossible space. It looks like a cube, composed of three cuboids with rectangular cross-sections. The three cuboids form a triangle, but the angle between two cuboids seems to be a right angle. The above properties can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane, but cannot be realized on any normal three-dimensional object. The painting “Waterfall” is precisely through the splicing of two Penrose triangles, making players have the illusion that the waterfall is flowing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F281fcf06-a82e-4b71-abba-bdbe71411201.jpg/size/" alt="Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>The game <em>Monument Valley</em> uses a large number of Penrose triangles as the game screen. The protagonist, IDA, shuttles through the impossible graphic space. Players only need to move or rotate the pillars in a certain order to reconstruct a feasible space and achieve the conditions for safe passage. As shown below, in this level, players need to overcome the three-dimensional illusion generated in the two-dimensional plane, help the protagonist of the game pass through the Penrose triangle corridor and reach another door. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F213753d3-ad61-4982-a425-ce317a9a39a6.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>In addition, the well-known Möbius strip is also an optical illusion phenomenon based on impossible space. A Möbius strip is a paper strip formed by twisting a piece of paper 180 degrees and then gluing the two ends together. If an ant is placed on this ring, it can walk from the front to the back without crossing the boundary, and keep going, giving the viewer an illusion of infinite loop. Although the Möbius strip exists in the three-dimensional world, it only has the characteristics of two-dimensional space. It has only one single-sided surface, rather than two sides in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F5fa6cb5e-4eb4-42dd-8ce5-c4006278e61a.png/size/" alt="Möbius Strip"></p>
<p>The buildings in the game <em>Monument Valley</em> also draw on the Möbius strip. The protagonist IDA can change from standing vertically to standing horizontally through the twisted corridor, that is, gravity has changed, which is an impossible picture in three-dimensional real life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F0154d8f3-3c14-467e-a82f-98c6dee561be.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Möbius Strip"></p>
<h2 id="2-Perspective-Illusions"><a href="#2-Perspective-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="2. Perspective Illusions"></a>2. Perspective Illusions</h2><p>Perspective means that two objects of the same size appear larger when they are closer to the person and smaller when they are farther away. Generally, parallel projection is used in games. In parallel projection, even if the distance of the object changes, the size of the image will not change; but in perspective projection, the distance will affect the size of the image. As shown below, these are two yellow lines of the same length, but the human brain will judge its size according to the environment in which the object is located, and think that the yellow line in the distance is longer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F856c2e2b-fcec-4b22-aabe-88d41d7166f8.png/size/" alt="Perspective Illusion"></p>
<p><em>Superliminal</em> uses the relationship between perspective depth and reference objects as the two core elements of the game. Players must change their perspective and think unconventionally in order to wake up from their dreams. As a basic gameplay, players need to pick up specific props in the environment, change the reference objects, and use the most direct perspective relationship to enlarge or reduce objects, so as to adjust specific props to the appropriate size and achieve the conditions for passing the level. For example, players can use the depth relationship between the cheese and the corridor to enlarge the cheese slice and make it a slope to jump over the hole in the ground. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1535552e-31f8-4b99-955b-46e6198b6cfa.png/size/" alt="Superliminal Cheese"></p>
<p>In the puzzle adventure game <em>Perspective</em>, perspective illusion is the main way to solve puzzles and explore the game world. Players can rotate the camera angle and use visual errors to create visual distance changes between platforms that are originally far apart, creating a path that does not exist to achieve the conditions for passing the level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F7e9803f9-96f6-4565-9367-0f86fc5c71b7.png/size/" alt="Perspective Game"></p>
<h2 id="3-Gestalt-Illusions"><a href="#3-Gestalt-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestalt Illusions"></a>3. Gestalt Illusions</h2><p>When people’s visual center focuses on a complex figure, the human brain will judge the object in front of it according to the familiar shapes or contours stored in memory. After obtaining relevant prompts, people’s visual experience will automatically complete the rest of the incomplete contours in the image. This is what is called Gestalt illusion in psychology. For example, in the figure below, the viewer seems to be able to automatically see a white triangle that does not actually exist. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F60da8bc7-2fb9-4f00-9a53-16b3ffc579b2.png/size/" alt="Gestalt Illusion"></p>
<p>In <em>Monument Valley</em>‘s “Ida’s RED Dream: AIDS charity special edition”, the third level uses the art of Gestalt visual illusion. This is a castle that cannot exist in the real world. Each light gray corridor can be completed by rotating the dark blue building. Players can rely on previous visual experience to automatically connect the corridors. In the game, once the light and shadow are unified, it means that a new path has appeared. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F33fea8c0-c1b0-4eec-9edf-1877fcc9a726.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Ida&#39;s Dream"></p>
<p>In the game <em>Gorogoa</em>, the game screen is divided into four parts, and each area will present a scene for players to explore. Players can zoom in on objects in the picture and find clues that can be spliced or embedded with other scenes, so that the originally static picture will become an animation. This game cleverly uses the Gestalt illusion suspense formed by perceptual prediction and integrates it into the traditional jigsaw puzzle game rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fd5e1dc12-7b26-4569-a22d-31c14bf4b633.png/size/" alt="Gorogoa"></p>
<h2 id="4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players"><a href="#4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?"></a>4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?</h2><p>Why can optical illusion games attract players with these wonderful visual phenomena? We have mainly summarized the following three aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene"><a href="#Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene"></a>Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene</h3><p>When the game character moves in the game space, it generally faces a fixed, preset picture. The perspective centered on the picture rather than the player’s control can better present the picture content, and it is also an optimized design that can smoothly advance the plot development, but it can also be critically considered as a manifestation of technological dehumanization.</p>
<p>Video games are places that pursue interactivity, and creators are constantly looking for ways to break the restrictions that bind players’ hands and feet. Optical illusion elements provide this possibility for game creators. In optical illusion games, players are no longer bystanders of the game screen. By manipulating the game perspective, players can actively change certain elements in the game scene. Players enhance their sense of immersion and substitution through interaction with the game scene.</p>
<h3 id="Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes"><a href="#Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes"></a>Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes</h3><p>In the game <em>Moncage</em>, players need to explore by interacting with objects in different worlds, and use visual errors to find a perfect angle to splice certain objects in the two worlds. The process of finding connections in different worlds in the game is not a blind trial and error, but players use their unique observation and imagination to break through the dimensions of time and space to find connections and unlock new spaces one by one. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F2c79c833-1183-4980-8df2-c12dc74a8670.png/size/" alt="Moncage"></p>
<p>The core gameplay of optical illusion games is to change perspectives and use visual differences to find the connections between different scenes, which requires players to break through conventional thinking and explore the true connections between the visual illusions presented in the game screen from different angles. Players can also gain a strong sense of satisfaction after exploring and completing the level.</p>
<h3 id="The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving"><a href="#The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving" class="headerlink" title="The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving"></a>The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving</h3><p>The pictures of optical illusion games are constructed from unique geometric figures and comfortable colors, and are supplemented by beautiful music to give players a beautiful sensory enjoyment. Through the combination of audio-visual elements, players can understand the artistic conception and gameplay of the optical illusion space as a whole, and discover and complete task plots during the interaction process to obtain psychological satisfaction. Players can get the dual pleasure of aesthetics and puzzle solving throughout the game process.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article introduces the main optical illusion phenomena, including: impossible spaces, perspective, and Gestalt illusions. The ingenious design of optical illusions can allow players to experience a visual feast that violates the laws of physics and the pleasure of exploration and puzzle solving. In the game, players need to use their own unique thinking, change perspectives, and use visual differences to combine seemingly unrelated scenes. Incorporating optical illusion elements into action, adventure, role-playing and other games to increase the fun gameplay may also allow players to gain a wonderful experience.</p>

    <title>The Use of Inclusive Language in Games and Their Localization</title>
    <url>/2022/10/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20221101_28584_1050173/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221101/28584_1050173.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>“Words have power, words are power, words could be your power.” — Mohammed Qahtani</p>
<p>In the process of games going global, we often rely on two types of text to communicate directly with players: one is in-game text; the other is communication within the community. These two types of discourse need to fully express the game maker’s game concept, creative ideas, and in-depth thinking, to avoid causing unintended discrimination and prejudice among players.</p>
<p>The game market research agency Newzoo once launched a player sentiment study on more than 1,500 people and released a report saying that diversity, fairness, and inclusion are becoming increasingly important in games. Many players do not necessarily feel a sense of belonging in the game or feel welcome in the game community, and these current situations are closely related to the use of inclusive language. This article will introduce inclusive language and its use in the game localization process.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process"><a href="#1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?"></a>1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?</h2><p>Inclusive language aims to avoid “expressions that express or imply ideas that are sexist, racist, or otherwise biased, prejudiced, or denigrating to any particular group of people.”</p>
<p>Inclusive language is based on the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI principles). It strives to avoid expressing or implying prejudice against any particular group of people, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups, and does not contain any content that may imply that a person is superior to another because of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability, or health status.</p>
<p>When we serve players from different backgrounds and of different types, of course, the producers do not want to form an opposition with a certain group because of this unnecessary or unintended language offense, which will have a bad impact on the game. It is a terrible consequence for the game to be opposed and boycotted, so it is particularly important to create an inclusive and diverse game environment and game community.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve"><a href="#2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve" class="headerlink" title="2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?"></a>2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?</h2><p>The definition of euphemism is “the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant”. If the localization team does not know what is offensive or what is unpleasant, the definition of euphemism becomes problematic.</p>
<p>And with cultural shifts, some originally “safe words” may also be introduced with risks. For example, the word “genius” has also been listed among words with gender inequality, class, and racial assumptions.</p>
<p>A recent interesting example discussed gender-inclusive solutions related to the nouns “mother” and “father”, suggesting the use of “gestational parent” and “non-birthing parent” instead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F85630923-c730-4201-806d-20bbb960c33e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Twitter officially released some “problem words” and recommended replacement words</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sensitive vocabulary mentioned above has also rapidly changed all aspects of game products. To avoid gender-sensitive words, EA went a step further in <em>The Sims 4</em> and directly removed the binary male and female categories from the creation menu. The localization practice of <em>The Sims 4</em> is also simple and effective: use non-gender-specific terms (for example, use “Police officer” instead of “Policeman” when describing “police”); look for neutral structures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fc3b88c23-584a-44de-8c85-e05461b86959.png/size/"></p>

Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices"></a>3. Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices</h2><p>In fact, many schools, publishing houses, etc. will organize “language guides” to serve diverse communities. Taking the “inclusive language guide” newly released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington in 2022 as an example, “problem words” are divided into four categories: racial, ethnic, national, religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native discrimination; disability discrimination; age discrimination; and gender and sexual orientation discrimination. When applied to games, we can also refer to them. The following are the problems that are prone to occur in each category.</p>
<h3 id="Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio"><a href="#Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio" class="headerlink" title="Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio."></a>Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio.</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fa4938950-ba42-457f-8724-76092fa6aff5.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="“Inclusive-Language-Guide”-released-by-the-Information-Technology-College-of-the-University-of-Washington"><a href="#“Inclusive-Language-Guide”-released-by-the-Information-Technology-College-of-the-University-of-Washington" class="headerlink" title="“Inclusive Language Guide” released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington"></a><em>“Inclusive Language Guide” released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington</em></h2><p>Using black and white to metaphorically represent good and evil is an offense. Associating white people with good and black people with evil is called the “black is black effect”. Muhammad Ali said in an interview in the 1980s: “…we got some things called White House cigars, White Swan soap, King White soap, White Cloud tissue… Angel food is white cake, and devil’s food is chocolate cake.”</p>
<p>Black and white are often considered to be derivatives of racist metaphors, with “black” representing undesirable, wrong, or bad things; “white” represents desirable, correct, and good things. These words perpetuate the concepts once used to oppress people of color. So in games, common inclusive language for term replacement includes: whitelist (changed to allowlist), blacklist (changed to blocklist), etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fef688944-7b9a-47c5-af8d-0cb87943a6c7.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In “Naraka: Bladepoint”, “Blocklist” is used instead of “Blacklist” to refer to the blacklist.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination"><a href="#Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination" class="headerlink" title="Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination"></a>Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination</h3><p>These two types of pitfalls do not appear frequently in the game. In the process of daily player contact or questionnaire design, we will use many words related to “people” and “identity”. By comparing the following, we can find that in the localization process, we should avoid describing people’s “aging” and “defectiveness”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fd9db7493-6954-4a0d-b650-0be1cff0e7b0.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Gender-Sexual-Orientation-Discrimination"><a href="#Gender-Sexual-Orientation-Discrimination" class="headerlink" title="Gender&#x2F;Sexual Orientation Discrimination"></a>Gender&#x2F;Sexual Orientation Discrimination</h3><p>According to recent research, in 2021, about 45% of gamers are women. This means that when we use words, we need to pay special attention to “gender-neutral words”. Newzoo also pointed out that “the old stereotype that games are only for boys or men no longer exists”. </p>

It has provided players with a third (genderless) option during the character creation process.</em></h2><p>There are many mistakes that are easy to make in gendered words. Let’s take the word “Guys” as an example:</p>
<p>The word “guys” originally referred to the English historical figure Guy Fawkes, but in the mid-18th century to the 20th century, the word began to be used in the United States to refer to “men” in general. Because there was no suitable phrase to represent the plural form of “you”, the plural form of “guys” eventually evolved into a colloquial form used to refer to a group of people.</p>
<p>Today, the word does not always mean “plural of men”, but critics believe that the word is sexist because, although it claims to be neutral, it actually positions men as the “default”. For women in male-dominated industries, using “guys” to refer to the whole reinforces their sense of being a minority. The word is also problematic for gender non-conforming people, for whom “guys” may be a misrepresentation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F4fb2b984-ab17-40e6-b4f1-bf67d5c781ad.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”"><a href="#“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”" class="headerlink" title="“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”"></a><em>“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”</em></h2><p>Similarly, you should not call a group of women “girls” at work, as this is demeaning and offensive. Phrases that should not be used when talking to or about women: Girls, Bossy, Feisty, Ball bust, Shrill, Sweetie, honey-bun.</p>
<p>In the community, instead of “hey guys”, we are more encouraged to use “hey everyone”, “hey everybody” or the simpler “hey all”. Of course, some games have more unique names for their players, such as players of <em>For All Time</em> being called “使君大人” (Shǐ jūn dàrén), and players of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> being called “forerunners”, etc. These words will give players a more intimate and inclusive feeling.</p>
<h2 id="4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism"><a href="#4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism" class="headerlink" title="4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism"></a>4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism</h2><p>The relative flexibility of English allows us to successfully navigate these unsettling and exclusive terms and phrases and find alternatives. However, in other languages, this is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at an example from Lera’s Broditsky’s TED Talk: There are ten pictures of people to be arranged in order. The instruction is: “Arrange the pictures from the youngest-looking to the oldest-looking.”</p>
<p>People who speak European languages usually arrange them from left to right, but people who speak Mandarin may arrange them from top to bottom, while people who speak Hebrew or Arabic arrange them from right to left. These differences come from different languages’ perceptions and expressions of time, and the concepts and vocabulary that exist in certain languages. For people who speak the Australian indigenous language Kuuk Thaayorre, right and left do not exist, so if you ask them for directions, they will not tell you to go straight and turn right, but for example, go south and then west.</p>
<p>There are many similar differences. Some languages differ in how they divide the color spectrum, and the boundaries between colors are not universal. In English, we have the word blue, which includes any different shades of blue. However, in Ukrainian, there is no such word, because the language distinguishes between light blue and dark blue. Some other languages only have a few colors, such as “light” and “dark”. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fe4e796a6-4bd5-4cc4-96e5-2d25b11752d8.png/size/"></h2><h2 id="Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”"><a href="#Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”" class="headerlink" title="Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”"></a><em>Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”</em></h2><p>Among the 6,900 languages in the world, more than 1&#x2F;4 of the languages make a distinction between genders. In addition to the differences in the use of color, left and right, etc. in different language environments mentioned above, in the process of multilingual localization, we can follow the following rules to use gender-related inclusive language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spanish:</strong> Use “@” or “X” to replace the letters that set the gender of words. Although not officially recognized, this has been a common usage in the past few years. But there is an inconvenience: these characters cannot be pronounced or read by text-to-speech applications, which will affect the dubbing of game audio and create obstacles for visually impaired people using such software.</li>
<li><strong>Italian:</strong> Using an asterisk (*) instead of –a (feminine) and –o (masculine) in words or using “@” for plural has become a common practice, especially online. However, this usage also has certain problems. If overused, the text will be full of asterisks, and symbols will appear every other word, causing reading difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>German:</strong> In German, the asterisk (<em>) can also be used to indicate that there are more variants besides the displayed variants. For example, “der</em>die Priester*in” represents all genders in the spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>French:</strong> In French, we are witnessing the reinvention of language. For example, creating gender-inclusive pronouns to merge known masculine and feminine forms into one (iel&#x2F;yel&#x2F;yelle&#x2F;ille&#x2F;ol), while creating new grammatical declensions for nouns and adjectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F4cf6e0e0-abb6-46ab-b083-2f0ca14d5352.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>With the large-scale increase in the number of global game players, games have penetrated into people’s daily lives. It is a concern for game manufacturers and even the entire game industry to allow every player to find a setting corresponding to themselves in the game, or to allow players of different attributes to feel equal, fair, and concerned in the game. Among them, the inclusive language of games is becoming increasingly important. We can use it to help build a fairer game world, so that the game can be suitable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, etc. At the same time, in the game localization process, we also need to take cultural differences into account, and adjust the content in combination with local culture, language habits, etc., so as to more accurately meet the needs of the target market.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221101/28584_1050175.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sports games have always been an important category in the global game market, and can be said to be a game genre that has run through a considerable period of history in the field of video games. No matter how the hardware environment changes or how the game market trends change, this type of theme has never been outdated. FIFA, NBA 2K, Pro Evolution Soccer, etc., these familiar and popular sports games for many gamers, also fully demonstrate the value of sports games.</p>
<p>For players, sports games can be regarded as a kind of casual game, occasionally playing a game of competition, or as a development game, where you can cultivate your favorite teams, players, etc.; and sports games also have the passion of fair competition that all games do not have, which is exciting. In foreign countries, the potential of the sports game market can be said to have been fully exploited, but in China, the situation seems to be not optimistic. With a large number of sports users, the corresponding market has been lukewarm, and the mobile game aspect is even worse. It seems that sports games have not yet found their track. Even big IPs from console platforms such as NBA 2K and FIFA have not been able to fully awaken the sports mobile game market.</p>
<p>Since the prospect of the sports game market is so promising and has been so stable for many years, why are there so few sports games that can stand out in China’s popular mobile game market?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products"><a href="#1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products" class="headerlink" title="1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products"></a>1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products</h2><p>The direction of users’ attention determines the preference of developers and publishers for theme selection. The audience of global major sports events is undoubtedly concentrated in football, and the NBA, as one of the most popular sports events, also has a large audience. When it comes to games, football and basketball games are also the two most numerous sports game categories. Unlike other forms of entertainment, sports are more likely to inspire people’s passion and even generate emotional attachment.</p>
<p>However, in China, compared with other game categories, there have always been relatively few sports games on the market. This is related to the characteristics of sports games themselves. Sports games such as FIFA, Pro Evolution Soccer, NBA 2K, and NBA LIVE all have very distinct labels: professional.</p>
<p>This is mainly reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, most of the fans of sports games are themselves fans or fans of the sport, and non-fans rarely get involved; on the other hand, sports games have a high threshold for research and development, such as physical collisions, operating feel, adaptation engines, player AI, etc., which also greatly increases the difficulty of research and development.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About"><a href="#2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About" class="headerlink" title="2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?"></a>2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?</h2><p>Why is such a big cake, but the actual performance is not satisfactory?</p>
<h3 id="Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization"><a href="#Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization" class="headerlink" title="Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization"></a>Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization</h3><p>Because sports games rely on sports events, their basic gameplay is nothing more than PVP (player-to-player) around the event, especially in mobile games, which is also the most acceptable mode for most players. However, monotonous gameplay will accelerate boredom, and PVP is not a permanent solution. Production teams often enrich the player experience by adding game modes. However, the harsh reality is that no matter what kind of attempt, it cannot solve the fundamental problem of the game. Most players will still choose the most basic PVP mode. Of course, there are also many players who will play against the computer on console sports games.</p>
<p>In addition, the emergence of highly homogeneous products is also a need for market competition. When a manufacturer launches a new model, other manufacturers will subsequently “copy” one. After all, they are games of the same category, and they cannot let competitors have something they don’t have, so the products on the market are developing in an increasingly similar direction. Under such circumstances, when the gameplay of sports games is too monotonous and the homogenization of sports games is strong, the potential of the entire sports game market will naturally be difficult to explode.</p>
<h3 id="Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation"><a href="#Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation"></a>Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation</h3><p>For sports game players, whether they are basketball fans or football fans, or fans of other sports, most of them continue to invest their energy in the game in order to continue the feeling of sweating on the field of their favorite sports, or to experience the operations that cannot be realized in real life in the game. In this way, even if our bodies are exhausted, we can still enjoy spiritual happiness. Therefore, sports players do not have a variety of types to choose from in terms of game selection like other players. They generally only play according to their sports hobbies. Even if new games appear, as long as they have nothing to do with their favorite projects, I am afraid they will not pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>In addition, for sports games that focus on operational confrontation, in order to reproduce the feel of the game on the real field through virtual programs and find a feeling of being on the scene, even if their operation methods are simplified, the operation difficulty is still higher than other competitive games, and it requires continuous improvement of self-operation to complete the game process to obtain a higher sense of accomplishment. Because there is a certain operational threshold, many mobile game players who are mainly casual will naturally not pay special attention to such games.</p>
<h3 id="Prone-to-Imbalance"><a href="#Prone-to-Imbalance" class="headerlink" title="Prone to Imbalance"></a>Prone to Imbalance</h3><p>The key to the gameplay of sports games lies in operating skills. The importance of skills in such games is self-evident. Its design will not only affect novice players, but also affect the operating manufacturers.</p>
<p>If the gameplay skills of a video game become very important, this will lead to many players being unwilling to spend money to buy game props. Most players will have such an idea: “Anyway, I can defeat my opponent with my ability, why bother spending that money”.</p>
<p>In this case, ordinary props are no longer attractive. In order to strive for a better return on investment in the limited business model of sports competitive games, games may launch more props that enhance attributes; and over time, the amplitude of attribute enhancement will become larger and larger, but this is the beginning of a game losing its balance. When more and more players spend a lot of money to buy high-attribute props, it may cause a group of players who enjoy fair competition to leave the game, because on the premise of relatively close skills, the improvement of props to attributes is like an insurmountable gap, which creates a serious vicious circle: “Reduction in the number of players - Difficulties in the income of agents - Agents make money on attribute props - Game imbalance”. In the end, it will become the original sin of player churn.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Do-Players-Want"><a href="#3-What-Do-Players-Want" class="headerlink" title="3. What Do Players Want?"></a>3. What Do Players Want?</h2><p>What kind of game do players who come from sports competitions need?</p>
<p>Looking at people who love sports, they have many things in common - love sports, pay attention to competitions, have a flamboyant personality, and trust teamwork. Therefore, if you want to capture the hearts of sports game users, you must start with professional needs, viewing needs, personality needs, and social needs.</p>
<p>Many players like to play the corresponding sports games of the projects they actually participate in in reality, because they want to replicate the feel of the hand&#x2F;foot in reality, or experience some elements that cannot be realized in actual sports projects. Therefore, to a certain extent, reasonably moving reality to the virtual world is always the pursuit of developers and players. In addition, some sports enthusiasts may not have been gamers before. The low threshold for getting started with the game, while having both technology and operational depth, can play a key role in expanding the player base, especially for mobile gamers. Of course, for some products that may not pursue IP, cool and gorgeous operations are always one of the biggest selling points to attract players: I wasn’t aiming for the players in the first place. If the actions are still plain, how can I be attracted? After all, for most gamers, the operation is only temporary, but being handsome is a lifetime.</p>
<p>In today’s era of increasingly developed hardware equipment, games with high-quality sound and pictures often have richer expressiveness and stronger appeal, and creating a sense of presence and immersion is also an important part of the game’s ability to attract players. Especially for sports games, the viewing value of the picture and action is more important. Regardless of whether it is related to sports feelings, or to IP and classic events, even if the audience is relatively fixed, the game also needs to arouse topics and awaken players’ attention. Players also hope to experience games with higher popularity.</p>
<h2 id="4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track"><a href="#4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track" class="headerlink" title="4. Opening Up a New Track?"></a>4. Opening Up a New Track?</h2><p>Even the best wine is not afraid of a deep alley. In the face of the dilemma of the sports game market, the quality of the game alone is not enough to break the situation. For a sports game, good game quality can attract fans of this series, but to seek breakthroughs, more sports enthusiasts and even sports pan-entertainment users need to know and accept it.</p>
<h3 id="Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events"><a href="#Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events" class="headerlink" title="Synchronous Operation with Physical Events"></a>Synchronous Operation with Physical Events</h3><p>If you want to expand the coverage, how to promote it has become a difficult problem. It is necessary to find effective brand exposure methods to build momentum for the game before or during the corresponding sports events to attract fans’ attention.</p>
<p>Use promotion methods that are synchronized with the operation period of sports events, and use platform resources in many aspects, not limited to game platforms. This will help to spread the influence of the game itself, so that users of multiple platforms will continue to increase their favorability of the game. Sports games themselves, as a category with a potentially huge user base, everyone, regardless of gender, age, likes sports, loves sports, but how to subdivide and differentiate users of this magnitude, and operate them in a refined manner, is worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="Creation-of-eSports-Event-System"><a href="#Creation-of-eSports-Event-System" class="headerlink" title="Creation of eSports Event System"></a>Creation of eSports Event System</h3><p>Create an event system, and then go out of the circle, so as to attract more fans to enter the game and increase player stickiness. For sports competitive games, on the basis of the current widespread e-sports alliance, we can try to build a complete sports game e-sports event system, while broadening the channels for public participation, and complete a larger scale of sinking and penetration; combined with community operation experience, promote “small community” type events in the game, making it easier for the public to participate in e-sports, and then introduce in-game events to offline communities.</p>
<p>For a sports game, the things that test people are definitely not just the above. In the final analysis, it is necessary to return to the game itself. How to design each stage of the game so that players do not have the fatigue of constantly repeating the season; how to set up players, how to let players play an unforgettable game, etc., these are also tricky. After all, the key to measuring an excellent sports game is to see whether it can narrow the distance between the game world and the real sports competition, and at the same time take into account the operability of the game, so that players can truly get an immersive and pleasant experience from the game.</p>

    <title>How to Build Playability Experience with Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics</title>
    <url>/2022/11/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20221123_28584_1053891/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221123/28584_1053891.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the game market develops, various games are constantly seeking new gameplay and game mechanics, striving to bring players novel and high-quality experiences. Game mechanics are like thousands of ways of arranging and combining various game elements, and they are gradually moving towards a more complex direction.</p>
<p>If a game is a process where players voluntarily overcome unnecessary obstacles, then how can we design interactions to make players willing to pay for these unnecessary obstacles instead of feeling bored? This article will elaborate on this in detail.</p>
<h2 id="1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="1. Starting with Game Mechanics"></a>1. Starting with Game Mechanics</h2><p>In Wikipedia, the description of game mechanics is as follows: In tabletop games and video games, game mechanics are constructs of rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state, thus providing gameplay. In other words, the mechanics of the game effectively regulate how the game will serve the person playing the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, this concept can perhaps be divided into two parts: “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics.” The former represents the player’s actual operation when using the device, such as “pressing WASD on the keyboard respectively”; while the latter is the corresponding action of the virtual character in the game, such as “the game protagonist walks in various directions respectively.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Ff3f5f4e6-b559-4a5a-a0a9-db70af47ac1d.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Just Dance 2》| Rasputin - Boney M. | Gameplay</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is high, players do not need to spend too much energy on the conversion mechanism between real operation and virtual feedback. For example, in the <em>Just Dance</em> series, the actions of the virtual characters are consistent with the player’s real actions, so players do not need to think about “what kind of actions do I need to perform to get a higher score?” They just need to imitate the characters in the game, so the playability of this game is high. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fa995ed01-2602-4a8c-86b9-52b24cf45141.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Longsword Advanced Aerial Combo</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is not high, the playability of the game decreases, but it also brings more room for operation. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, in order for the character to execute the appropriate combo, the player needs to press a series of buttons at the appropriate time nodes in order to realize the conversion of real actions to virtual character actions, which has higher requirements for the player’s various comprehensive operations. In this kind of more complex game mechanics, how to create high playability is a test that designers must face.</p>
<p>“Playing a game” is “voluntarily overcoming unnecessary obstacles.” — Bernard Suits, <em>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</em></p>
<p>As the game market continues to expand, the game’s mechanisms have also become more complex in permutation and combination. How to make players voluntarily accept these complex mechanisms in the game? This requires interaction design to communicate “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics”, efficiently complete the interaction between players and the game, that is, the game will give feedback in time according to the player’s input, helping players make operations in the most friendly and effective way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics"></a>2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics</h2><p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, mentioned earlier, includes game mechanics such as scenes, teams, actions, confrontations, matching, and skills. Therefore, this section mainly uses the combat content of this game as an example to illustrate the role of interaction in complex mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics"><a href="#Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics"></a>Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics</h3><p>First of all, the most straightforward auxiliary explanation is the familiar “novice tutorial.” In games, it is very efficient and necessary to use the novice tutorial method for interaction with core or unfamiliar mechanics. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, because its combat contains a lot of information, in addition to the common team and poison elements of battle royale games, it also contains many hero characteristics, souljades and other content.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the novice tutorial, the UI of the interface is unfolded in sequence. It can be seen that the initial interface of the novice tutorial only contains basic information, orientation, and map information that players are familiar with, while other content will appear with corresponding UI information as the tutorial unfolds. This is to allow players to gradually understand the game’s combat mechanics, and try to avoid players experiencing frustration and resistance when encountering too much complex information. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Novice Tutorial, after guiding the player to pick up a weapon and introducing related content, the weapon-related UI in the lower right corner appears.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The novice tutorial of this game can be opened by yourself when selecting the mode on the homepage, providing a quick entry to the novice tutorial, which is also a common method for games with more complex mechanics. However, games with simpler mechanics are more likely to enter the tutorial directly when entering the game for the first time, and no tutorial entry will be provided after that. In addition, no matter whether the novice tutorial mechanism is simple or complex, it is generally necessary to provide players with a channel to “exit&#x2F;skip” the tutorial immediately, such as pressing the Esc key at any time in the tutorial to return to the lobby.</p>
<h3 id="Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles"><a href="#Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles" class="headerlink" title="Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles"></a>Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles</h3><p>The medium of player interaction in complex mechanics is almost still the keyboard and mouse or the controller, and the moves of the characters in the game in combat are very complex, so most of the abstract mechanics and concrete mechanics in combat are very dissimilar. To improve the playability experience of the game, interaction design can try to add concrete elements to abstract mechanisms to increase the similarity between abstract mechanisms and concrete mechanisms psychologically, so as to obtain a better immersive experience and playability experience.</p>
<p>For example, when using the grappling hook item in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players and the keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;controller obviously cannot interact like the grappling hook and the character, but the aiming feedback that appears after pressing the “Q” key, and the fixed feedback of the rope flying out after clicking the mouse, all improve the player’s playability experience through the concrete UI. </p>

<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 When using the grappling hook in the game, press “Q” and the aiming interaction feedback appears.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, sometimes in order to increase the challenge of the game, the game will adopt the opposite abstract and concrete mechanisms. At this time, it is very important to let players feel the rationality of the interaction method in the interface. Because essentially, this is the player voluntarily giving up the means to quickly achieve the goal, and voluntarily accepting certain restrictions, choosing a “low-efficiency” way to participate in the game.</p>
<p>For example, in the segment of driving a wooden boat in <em>It Takes Two</em>, when the player controlling Cody sprays honey backwards, the effect of spraying to the left is that the wooden boat moves to the right. At this time, the direction of the player’s operation and the direction of the wooden boat are opposite, but in the interface, the form of Cody spraying honey at the tail as power allows the player to understand the logic of the opposite operation and voluntarily accept this setting that increases the difficulty. This is the same principle in its famous airplane flying segment. </p>

<ul>
<li>Highlight the central area of the screen, leaving enough vision for combat;</li>
<li>Various combat information is classified and integrated, distributed in appropriate positions around the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fc1fae52b-7a9b-4c5b-acad-5e3567e503a8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Combat Interface Information Layout</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Here, in the combat interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the clotting salve, armor powder, and weapon box, which are also props, are displayed in different blocks, also out of consideration of content relevance, so that players can consider whether to use the weapon box to repair the weapon while paying attention to the weapon durability in the lower right corner, facilitating the player’s interaction process. In addition, there is a special key prompt block in this interface, and there are key icons at the skills, weapons, and map, also in order to make it easier for players to fight in complex mechanisms through efficient and reasonable interaction.</p>
<p>Complex game mechanics have limited the conditions for players to achieve game victory. The work of interaction design needs to facilitate players so that they can voluntarily accept these constraints and enjoy them. The classification and integration of information is very important here. Efficient information presentation enables players in the game to quickly retrieve the information they need on the screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F819d980e-0d7a-4199-b2c4-9c71c7be9c4c.png/size/"></p>

Images are symbolic languages that are easier for people to process than text, and there are almost no localization differences; while the interaction of sound does not need to occupy additional vision in the interface.</p>
<p>Also taking the presentation of skill and prop information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example. The UI of the ultimate skill CD is the icon of Viper Ning, and the surrounding circular progress bar and the Arabic numerals above quickly inform the player of the CD status. After the CD is completed, the outer glow effect and key prompts appear, and at the same time, it is matched with the in-game character voice prompt. The visual presentation part is efficient and cross-language, and the auditory part is efficient and extremely immediate. This interactive presentation is very efficient, and it also connects different states of the UI, thereby building a user experience that serves the player. </p>

For example, adding a “character” mechanism to ordinary battle royale game mechanics requires attention to the character characteristics of oneself and the opponent in the game; adding “skills” and “ranged&#x2F;melee weapons” mechanisms is accompanied by the necessary presentation of skill and weapon information in the game. However, if too much information is presented in the interface, it is easy to make players daunting at the initial contact, or it is difficult to find the point where the line of sight needs to be focused in the game.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in the presentation of weapon-related information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the visual effect is weakened by increasing the transparency of weapons that are equipped but not in use, which can more intuitively display the selected state of the weapon, and also save valuable screen vision. Hiding information does not mean reducing information, but making hidden information display when needed. The same is true for pop-up windows and folded pages in various game interfaces. Players do not need to see it directly on the main interface, they just need to be able to open it smoothly and independently when needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1b6bdb14-2456-408d-80e4-e340613da08e.png/size/"></p>

<p>When do you notice the presence of the UI during the game? - When the game UI is done very poorly.</p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is almost a UI-less interface. Only a prompt or icon will appear on the screen, but players do not feel that there is too little information or that the operation is not smooth in the game, which is also an effective hiding of information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F68d4c4f4-a491-4bb8-9375-8816e598b11c.jpg/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Playability, also known as gameplay, reflects the impact of all internal components of the game on the player’s gaming experience, and the components can include game rules, game interaction with the player, game challenges and difficulty, etc., that is, “what players can do.” In other words, the reason why a game can become a game is precisely because it has playability, allowing players to obtain fun in its limited mechanisms.</p>
<p>For the presentation of game mechanics, the UI is the player’s “mechanism translator”; for the playability of the game, the UI is the player’s “operation helper”. Whether it is game workers or players, they will be excited about more and wider unknown game mechanics. How to better interpret the new composite game mechanics and how to let the mechanics bring players a high-quality experience are difficult problems that UI design needs to consider.</p>

    <title>“Join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect” Don’t Let Game Trainers Ruin the Experience</title>
    <url>/2022/11/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20221123_28584_1053894/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221123/28584_1053894.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In competitive games, normal players are deeply disgusted by cheaters. However, when some players are enjoying the game, they encounter obstacles that they cannot bypass, or hurdles they cannot overcome. There are always some people who will take the wrong path, using third-party software to modify game data, directly cheating, or cutting off the opponent’s network cable. The act of running third-party software is usually not only strongly condemned by the majority of players, but will also be severely punished by the game officials, ranging from warnings to account bans. However, in single-player games, players seem to be more tolerant of modifying game values, and prefer to call the “cheats” of single-player games “trainers”.</p>
<p>For example, a very popular meme among players is - Join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, which is a trainer for a cultivation game. Because the game randomly generates many plots, some players are repeatedly chased or robbed and want to vent their anger, while some players’ Taoist companions are killed and want revenge. At this time, some players will ask them to join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, that is, they suggest that the other party use a trainer. It seems that players are not resistant to this form, and even using it properly can enhance the game experience. So how should we correctly view and use trainers?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification"><a href="#1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification" class="headerlink" title="1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?"></a>1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?</h2><p>On Steam, many games have “Workshop”, in which there are many player-made and provided game Mods. Mod is taken from the first three letters of the word modification.</p>
<p>There are many types of Mods. Fashion Mods are used to change the appearance of characters. In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, players can use fashion Mods to turn themselves into various different characters. Map Mods can change the in-game map or directly create a new map. In <em>CS: GO</em>, there are many players who spontaneously form community servers to play hide-and-seek modes that are not available on official servers. There are also many other game content Mods such as sound effects and skills. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1d879bc3-00e9-4283-9255-2c285db4be54.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p>Human Fall Flat, players use Mods to create custom skins</p>
<hr>
<p>The production of these contents is essentially a modification of the game. The existence of Mods is to increase the game content and allow players to experience things outside the game itself, and the continued popularity of many games is also due to the large number of Mods. Some people may think of DLC here, the content of which is similar to some Mods. To distinguish Mods from game DLC, Mods can be understood more as content spontaneously produced and released by players, and they are generally free to use. However, due to technical limitations, they may have some compatibility issues with the game or other Mods. DLC is officially produced and launched game expansion content, which usually requires payment to experience, and is naturally more compatible and stable than player-made Mods. </p>

<hr>
<p>Elden Ring wacky Mod that replaces the horse with Thomas the Tank Engine</p>
<hr>
<p>Compared with Mods, “game trainers” focus more violently on modifying game values and reducing game difficulty, so the functions are relatively simple and crude, with a list of several shortcut keys, players only need to move their fingers to completely subvert the game values. Common functions in trainers include infinite health, infinite mana, infinite money, and so on. I believe some people can still skillfully type Panzer, the cheat code for summoning tanks.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?"></a>2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?</h2><p>Different players may have very different pursuits and goals after entering the game, and these are also highly related to their different game experiences. In past research, we have summarized some reasons why players use trainers, and classified them.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Game-Difficulty"><a href="#Reduce-Game-Difficulty" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Game Difficulty"></a>Reduce Game Difficulty</h3><p>It is undeniable that many players have strong talents in gaming and can easily clear many difficult games. However, according to the player ability grading theory, these talented players only occupy a very small part of the top of the player pyramid. We can call them pro-gamers, some of whom are even close to the level of e-sports players. However, there are still many players whose game level is not so high, and the number of these players is much larger, and the overall ability level is also at the middle of the ability grading pyramid. They have certain operating strengths, but often want to experience more games in their spare time. However, the difficulty of some games is too high, and the outward ability performance based on experience and strength may not match this difficulty, which will cause them to spend a lot of time looking up guides, learning skills, and polishing moves.</p>
<p>However, leisure is their biggest purpose in playing games, not becoming stronger. Especially in single-player games, the appearance of trainers can help them experience the full content of the game more easily. Although the core content of some high-difficulty games is to experience hardship and become stronger little by little, if a player cannot persist in playing, then the follow-up of this game will have nothing to do with this player, including carefully crafted content such as plot stories, visual effects, and background music. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F354cb7c7-6356-48e8-8371-69273b40c560.png/size/" alt="The roguelike game Dead Cells, which sold 4 million copies, launched an official trainer in June 2022"></p>
<h3 id="Experience-Different-Game-Content"><a href="#Experience-Different-Game-Content" class="headerlink" title="Experience Different Game Content"></a>Experience Different Game Content</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, many game Mods or trainers can add a lot of new content for players to experience, even player-made BOSSes and side quests. The famous blacksmithing game <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> was released in 2019 and is still popular today. Some players are not satisfied with the normal + double difficulty content of the game itself, so some players have created a series of high-difficulty Mods such as Resurrection, Nightmare, and Gauntlets of Strength, among which Gauntlets of Strength even adds two side quests that are not in the main game. These game Mods have modified the difficulty of the game, added more moves to the BOSS, and allowed hardcore players to experience a cooler and more challenging <em>Sekiro</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1790b6c1-fd60-41e2-89b0-11e7d98d662a.png/size/" alt="Sekiro Gauntlets of Strength Mod"></p>
<h3 id="“Protect-the-Liver”"><a href="#“Protect-the-Liver”" class="headerlink" title="“Protect the Liver”"></a>“Protect the Liver”</h3><p>Many RPG games have some extremely “grindy” tasks. These tasks either have extremely high material quantity requirements, or have difficulty and drop rate bottlenecks. Players often need to complete a large number of repetitive and boring farming processes to complete these tasks. Some players may not have any complaints about this repetitive step-by-step collection, but there are also players who do not like this boring collection process, and trainers can help players shorten the boring and repetitive game process, and can also provide some rest for the player’s “liver”.</p>
<p>For these players, the appearance of trainers is undoubtedly a godsend. The Japanese RPG game <em>Octopath Traveler</em> has a game mechanism where enemies may be encountered when moving, and the level limit is tied to the experience of the game plot. Players must repeat the mechanical farming and leveling to experience more of the plot, which makes many players call out that they are “tired”. Trainers can save some farming and leveling time for players who only want to experience the plot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fbdbd84bd-42b2-4121-9c31-ad78a348c8e2.png/size/" alt="Octopath Traveler"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Game-More-Personalized"><a href="#Make-the-Game-More-Personalized" class="headerlink" title="Make the Game More Personalized"></a>Make the Game More Personalized</h3><p>Different players will have different preferences for game content, and game makers are not omnipotent and cannot cover the preferences of most players. Trainers can provide players with a “superpower” to quickly skip content they don’t like, allowing players to customize their personalized experience and focus more on the “boutique” content they really like to play.</p>
<h2 id="3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats"><a href="#3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats" class="headerlink" title="3. Trainers VS Game Cheats"></a>3. Trainers VS Game Cheats</h2><p>As mentioned at the beginning, many players are more tolerant of modifying game values in single-player games. This is the biggest difference between trainers and cheats - whether your behavior affects others, and whether your happiness is at the expense of other players’ gaming experience. The author believes that using trainers in single-player games only changes the game experience of the user alone. Whether it is increasing the difficulty or simplifying the process, most of them only affect the user himself; while using trainers in multiplayer battle mode will affect the game experience of everyone in the same game, and building one’s own happiness on the pain of others is extremely unfair to other players. Here, the multiplayer battle mode not only refers to the online multiplayer mode, but also content that is related to and competes with other players can be regarded as multiplayer mode, such as game leaderboards, speedruns, achievement acquisition, etc. Using trainers and other improper means to participate in this kind of competition will also not be recognized. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F0ee7bcca-c1f8-4dc6-b211-0b4f75d05846.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers"><a href="#Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers"></a>Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Improper use will greatly accelerate the consumption speed of game content.</strong> When using trainers, direct numerical modifications should be reduced, and instead, some disliked game content should be reduced from the side. Different types of games have different core content. When using trainers, try to ensure that the core gameplay is not affected or is less affected. When experiencing survival games, when the player’s survival materials reach a level that cannot be used up, then the meaning of “survival” is lost. Therefore, in such games, try not to use trainers with unlimited resources; and when experiencing combat games, using trainers with unlimited health will distort the core experience of such games. The skipped process should be content that is meaningless to the user, not the core content of the game, to prevent the situation of being “invincible” but only being happy for half an hour, and then the whole game becomes boring.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Ff3a4a249-3426-44fd-8307-25c711b2f47b.png/size/" alt="The Dead Cells official trainer can choose the number of revives"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is easy to develop a dependence on trainers.</strong> The function of trainers is very powerful. Players only need to move their fingers to operate simple key combinations to solve almost all problems in the game. Such a simple and crude means of winning is easy to make people psychologically dependent. In fact, every time you use a trainer, you need to carefully consider which things should really be skipped with the trainer, so as to maximize the overall game experience. Excessive dependence and overuse of trainers can also easily make you miss important experiences and core fun points, and lose interest in the games that you originally expected and downloaded to play.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In order to obtain a “better” gaming experience, it is the original intention of most players to use trainers. In various game playthrough videos, there will be many “cloud players” who only watch game live videos and do not experience the game themselves. Some of them are because they don’t have time to grind, and some are because they are “handicapped” and can’t beat the game, so they can only see the excitement of the game in the video. Trainers do not have to be a target of criticism, but a tool that can be used well to help some players better enjoy the game. For players, if they can get more fun without affecting others, it is a successful modification.</p>

    <title>Is Fragmented Narrative Pretentious</title>

<p>There are many ways to tell a story. It can be expressed in novels, movies, plays, and many other art forms. Telling a story with a game has a very unique advantage, that is, interactivity. In the process of experiencing the game, players truly play the role of the characters in the story, connect with the characters in the story, and then advance the plot. In some games, the player’s behavior will also determine the final direction of the plot. The player is not only the listener of the story, but also the creator of the story. There are also many ways of game narration. This article will briefly introduce them, and focus on the advantages and disadvantages of fragmented narration and its application in games.</p>
<h2 id="I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration"><a href="#I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration" class="headerlink" title="I. Common Ways of Game Narration"></a>I. Common Ways of Game Narration</h2><h3 id="Linear-Narrative"><a href="#Linear-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Linear Narrative"></a>Linear Narrative</h3><p>Typical linear narratives include games such as <em>Death Stranding</em> and the <em>Call of Duty</em> series. These linear narrative games make players feel like watching a fine movie in terms of plot. There are a lot of main quests and cutscenes. Linear narrative sacrifices a certain degree of freedom in experience in exchange for the stability of players’ acceptance of the plot. Players are more passive in receiving plot information, such as watching a cutscene after completing a main quest to get the plot. </p>

<h3 id="Branching-Narrative"><a href="#Branching-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Branching Narrative"></a>Branching Narrative</h3><p>The overall structure is similar to linear narrative. The biggest difference is that branching points are added to the game. Players make different choices and enter different plot lines, such as <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, <em>Quantum Break</em>, etc. </p>

<h3 id="Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Fragmented Narrative"></a>Fragmented Narrative</h3><p>Literally, fragmented narrative is to split the overall plot into fragments and integrate them with various contents in the game. For example, after a player obtains a certain item, they obtain key clues about the relationship between characters in the game or the plot from the item description; when a player encounters a BOSS under certain conditions, they trigger hidden dialogues to obtain information; the main line of the fragmented narrative game will not be very clear. Players need to actively discover the information hidden in various corners and piece them together (sometimes requiring some imagination) to obtain a plot story understood and created by the players themselves. The following will also focus on examples.</p>
<h2 id="II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games"><a href="#II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="II. Fragmented Narrative in Games"></a>II. Fragmented Narrative in Games</h2><p>The application of fragmented narrative in games is very common. For example, in <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, a large amount of information is integrated with props, injecting this method of finding information in props into the player’s subconscious at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>The Wolf, played by the player, receives a letter from an unknown person at the beginning of the game. The description of this letter not only contains the content of the letter, but also a sentence “A letter thrown to the bottom of the well by someone”. It not only wants to inform the player of the content of the letter, but also wants the player to understand where this item comes from, what information is related to the item, who is it related to, and why. So that players slowly get used to this narrative method of integrating information into props, and gradually arouse their curiosity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F2db2a1ba-503d-4265-92f3-55f4dacddc20.png/size/"></p>
<p>Many settings in the game are not directly presented to the player in the form of animation or text, but are recorded in various items obtained by the player. Players will have a more cherished attitude towards the items obtained through difficult battles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F8d343e54-ca9d-4b7d-86e6-e96903e9d5d2.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F96db1573-f74a-4ea3-877d-7c3d943e42fd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Sekiro uses various props to tell the history of the Sekiro world</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the most direct plot is only the introduction of the game’s background, that is, heroes from all walks of life gather in Morus Isle to compete for the Immortal Mask. But are these heroes related to each other? For this reason, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also uses some fragmented narrative techniques to introduce the background of the characters and the connections between them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F4b98449a-9dfb-476f-b5fe-8067acfecbbc.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F902a4aed-7145-40a1-ad71-381228d1356b.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, in the fashion description, the origin and story of this fashion are added, telling the background of Kurumi and her best friend Viper Ning becoming enemies. This setting also attracts many players to explore the reasons why Viper Ning and Kurumi changed from best friends to enemies.</p>
<h2 id="III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative"></a>III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative</h2><p>Fragmented narrative has received widespread attention in recent years with the popularity of games such as <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Due to some of its characteristics, it has corresponding advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-Players"><a href="#Advantages-for-Players" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for Players"></a>Advantages for Players</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Extends game time and has a better new game plus experience</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative splits a lot of information into various corners of the game, and players can have a richer experience in exploration. In contrast, when experiencing linear narrative games, many players may leave the game after experiencing the main quest once, and will not open it a second time. Fragmented narrative gives players a lot of room for exploration. Players who want to piece together a more complete plot need to explore more carefully in new game plus, obtain more props and clues, enhance the player’s experience in subsequent playthroughs, and alleviate the repetition of multiple playthroughs. Players can be pleasantly surprised to discover more game details and plot connections.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High degree of freedom, players can choose the plot direction they want to explore</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative does not directly present the plot to the player like linear narrative, but lets the player explore it themselves. This gives the player a higher degree of freedom, that is, what information they want to obtain is determined by the player’s own initiative. The plot is lengthy, unimportant, or uninteresting. Content can be chosen not to be explored, and plot connections that are of great interest can be chosen to be explored first.</p>
<p>When players piece together clues, they often add a process of imagination, which allows different players to have different understandings of the game plot. Under the official setting, various understandings can be made, as long as the logic is complete and reasonable. It can become the perfect story in the player’s mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F215377a7-9834-4eab-b576-e52624005b41.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In “Elden Ring”, players are allowed to interpret the story themselves. It is not just the order of reading the story, even the internal logical order of the story is not fixed</em></p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Stronger sense of immersion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In fragmented narrative games, players not only need to complete combat levels, but also need to complete the collection and piecing together of the plot, and even some imagination. The process of exploration further enhances the player’s sense of immersion. Players need to actively recall, think, and piece together a complete plot, rather than passively accepting the instillation of cutscenes.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-the-Game"><a href="#Advantages-for-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for the Game"></a>Advantages for the Game</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Relatively low cost and flexible development</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of fragmented narrative can use a large amount of text bound to props, NPCs, etc., reducing the production of cutscenes and real-time rendering, thereby reducing costs. At the same time, the content of fragmented narrative is relatively discrete, and the content connection in the plot is relatively less tight. It will be more natural to modify or delete during the development process, and the overall impact on the plot is smaller.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Different players have different understandings of the plot, which will trigger higher discussion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the plot of a fragmented narrative game requires players to collect, piece together, and imagine. Players will have different understandings of the plot, and the collision of their views will cause intense discussions. Players’ reposts and discussions on social media can increase the popularity of the game and attract more fresh blood.</p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>It should be noted that some of the above advantages of fragmented narration are also double-edged swords, which may become disadvantages for different players.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Friendly to new game plus players, but not friendly to light players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of the game takes a lot of time to dig out. Some places may need to be revisited, and some clues may be deeply buried. These are of course a great pleasure for players who are keen on exploring, but for some players who just want a light experience, The game burden is relatively heavier. For such players, the linear narrative movie-like plot flow experience will be better.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High requirements for plot copywriting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative presents players with one point after another, but in the eyes of copywriters, it must be a rigorous logical framework. A large number of clues must be guaranteed to be free of contradictions and contain a certain amount of information. If the game is full of useless clues, players will question it as being pretentious and unintelligible.</p>
<p>If there is a deviation in the focus of the game plot, it will be difficult for players to experience the core plot that the game really wants to convey. Excellent copywriting can ensure that more players move towards the key clues and plots, and ensure the player’s experience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Higher memory cost for players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Although many games can take out props at any time to view descriptions and clues, a large amount of text content describes the background of the story and the relationship between characters through props or NPCs, which still brings a certain memory burden to players. Players need to recall in a large number of props which props describe which characters can piece the fragments together.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Conclusion"><a href="#IV-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="IV. Conclusion"></a>IV. Conclusion</h2><p>The fragmented narrative method has become familiar to more players with the popularity of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> in recent years. Its advantages and disadvantages are obvious. Players who like this method will be very obsessed with exploring the plot, so that there are so many “Soul scholars”, “Sekiro scholars”, and “Elden Ring scholars” constantly exploring and producing content to share and discuss.</p>
<p>Optimizing the experience of light players in the plot, while ensuring the exploration experience of deep players, can allow more players to change from light to deep, and explore those mysterious worlds. Excellent fragmented narrative plots are carefully arranged by copywriters to present players with an epic story. Those games that use the name of fragmented narrative but actually have fragmented plots, far-fetched connections, and obscurity are “pretentious”.</p>

    <title>The Renaissance of Nostalgic Games - Nostalgia That&#39;s Not Necessarily Long-Lasting</title>
    <url>/2022/08/21/netease-ux-articles/news_20221128_28584_1054990/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221128/28584_1054990.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>Nostalgia is good business.</p>
<p>On June 16th, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> was officially released and achieved good results. When the theme song of the 1987 TV animation <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> is played, you will know that the main theme of this game is nostalgia. Everything in the game now seems to have a sense of age, and it can immediately take people back to the time when they were sitting in front of the TV watching cartoons or playing cartridge games years ago. Its target users are also very clear, namely the audience of the animation at that time and the arcade game players in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Now it seems that these products born for nostalgia still have countless old players paying for them, which makes more manufacturers today see this good business. We can also see that by 2022, there are more and more products that use nostalgia to attract users. So, how to use nostalgia to attract players? And why do people love “nostalgia” so much?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work"><a href="#1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?"></a>1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?</h2><p>Nowadays, players who are attracted by sentiment have a relatively high tolerance for the quality of games, but with the development and maturity of sentiment, players’ demand for the quality of such games is also rapidly increasing. Many game manufacturers that play the nostalgia card have also realized the development and changes of players’ current needs, and have begun to carry out more detailed operations for the theme of “nostalgia”. From the player’s point of view, even if they have long realized that the manufacturer is using the banner of nostalgia to make money, when they see those familiar scenes and characters, they will still involuntarily feel a surge in their hearts and open their wallets.</p>
<p>So, how do manufacturers manipulate “nostalgia”?</p>
<h3 id="Original-Flavor"><a href="#Original-Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Original Flavor"></a>Original Flavor</h3><p>In August 2019, <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> was launched, which can be said to be a milestone of the “original flavor” school. Behind the popularity, the nostalgic culture has set off another wave of trends in game media, live broadcast platforms, and video websites. The player group and the capital market have given double certification to Classic. The concept of “original flavor” has also been further consolidated in the minds of many game manufacturers. After all, before this, very few online games were willing to bring out old content from more than ten years ago almost unchanged and sell it, even if they wanted to sell it, they would carry out a series of operations such as “HD remake”, “gameplay optimization”, and “introduction of innovation”.</p>
<p>Now it seems that Classic can bring huge benefits. The rough pictures and immature designs of the original flavor not only did not expose their shortcomings, but instead became a weapon to evoke players’ feelings at the first time. While everyone complains about the imbalance and inconvenience, they don’t forget to add a sentence “It was like this back then”, and then happily eat the meal of remembering the past.</p>
<p>The success of all this also proves the feasibility of “original flavor” restoration from the side. If players are given the opportunity to play again from scratch, most people will burst out with a higher desire to consume than before, with a yearning for the past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fb31a4b1f-2848-43a5-8f58-fdab99a2e095.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Old-Formula-New-Taste"><a href="#Old-Formula-New-Taste" class="headerlink" title="Old Formula, New Taste"></a>Old Formula, New Taste</h3><p>Different from the “true original flavor” of Classic, there are also some nostalgic products that focus more on providing players with the first impression of “the same as before”, and adding new elements that meet current trends in gameplay design, functional modules, and social systems. Many of the gameplay and functions of these games are now considered to be in the category of “dead on arrival”. After years of exploration, manufacturers have also researched their own solutions that both capture the nostalgic mentality of old players and adapt to the current market.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the production team deliberately restored the previous rich scene interaction and exaggerated and humorous plot settings in the game. For example, in the previous <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> series, players could hit the manhole cover thrown by the enemy to defeat the opponent; enemies would suddenly burst out of the window from the shops on the street; when players encountered various trap scenes, they might also be crushed into slices, smashed into pieces, burned into small black figures, and even rubbed their eyes when they were splashed with sand, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F3755c316-84a4-4a3d-b804-6be5a3fb21a6.png/size/"></p>
<p>But while restoring the former flavor, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> also added a lot of new things. In terms of design, an attribute system has been added. The three attributes of range, speed, and power are different according to the characteristics of the character itself; in terms of operation, more operation commands have been added, such as double jump, dodge and other actions; in terms of gameplay, the “ultimate skill” has added an energy bar design, and a blocking system has also been introduced for monsters; in terms of social interaction, more cooperative gameplay has been added, such as combos, interactions, rescues, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F92ec7849-718a-4d4a-9a41-5f3a39b7c283.png/size/"></p>
<p>For individual players, when this game reappears in front of them “unchanged” after many years, they will feel somewhat unclear. The players still want to play this game, but because people’s aesthetics and mentality are constantly changing, now it has put on a more “fashionable coat” and appeared in front of the players in a brand new posture, which must be more fascinating.</p>
<h3 id="Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”"><a href="#Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Social “New Trend”"></a>Creating a Social “New Trend”</h3><p>For manufacturers, longer-term nostalgia is not only efficient harvesting of feelings, but also allows themselves to become a new topic of trend. In the business of nostalgia, social attributes, as a positive factor that can connect players’ emotions and promote the spontaneous spread of the game among players’ communities, can to a certain extent amplify the symbolic marketing of nostalgia and make it a new trend for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mole Manor</em>, as a childhood memory of the post-90s generation, was originally a children’s game for elementary school to junior high school students. Therefore, when the game manufacturer relaunched this game, they needed to consider how to satisfy the feelings and attract the adult group. Based on this, the operation of <em>Mole Manor</em> mobile game is to push topics such as “working in the game”, “checking in at internet celebrity shops and internet celebrity attractions”, and “establishing a fan community” to the vast social platform. By fitting the current state of the players who have grown up, the social attributes are amplified, and a certain degree of gameplay is abandoned, leading to a wave of “nostalgic new trends”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F9bd18d2b-0d20-44e2-b0c6-45be4bbb172b.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun"><a href="#2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun" class="headerlink" title="2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?"></a>2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?</h2><p>In general, this type of game is still more about nostalgia than gameplay. So why is it that playing a game from many years ago feels more fun than modern games?</p>
<h3 id="Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment"><a href="#Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment" class="headerlink" title="Unburdened Pure Enjoyment"></a>Unburdened Pure Enjoyment</h3><p>Today’s games are constantly improving in quality, and the game content is becoming more and more detailed, and the requirements for players are also increasing. When playing games, players have more information to receive and process: more refined graphics, more detailed music, more realistic animations and interactive systems. Although these elements make the game as a whole more refined and beautiful, it has to be admitted that they also bring more burden to players.</p>
<p>In other words, more delicate motion animations and more realistic sound effects bring players a “real” sense of immersion; but at the same time, the problem is that the difficulty of game operation will also increase, which requires players to adapt to the operation. In comparison, sometimes it is indeed not as good as the pure enjoyment brought by easier-to-use game operations and higher fun, which is more popular with players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F82ca5657-2dc3-43cb-ad46-7d00a042871d.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again"><a href="#Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again" class="headerlink" title="Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again"></a>Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again</h3><p>The irreplaceable emotional value can help nostalgic games recall the most loyal core players. This value is partly given by the unique gameplay of the game itself, and on the other hand, it is also deeply hidden in the emotional connection of playing games with friends in the past.</p>
<p>For players, when mentioning a certain game, the biggest nostalgic memory may be around playing with friends, making friends in the game, sharing interests, and enjoying the experience of mutual competition and cooperation. So when a nostalgic game is relaunched, players can’t help but recall the happiness that this game once brought them, and they will think of the time when they left their friends in the game or cooperated with them in the process of completing tasks. These experiences allow players to have a deeper social connection with others, and naturally they will pour deeper emotions into this game, prompting them to download the game again even after so many years, and then poke the friends who played with them back then: Hey, do you want to play another round together?</p>
<h3 id="Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics"><a href="#Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics"></a>Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics</h3><p>In today’s various AAA games, when the game has a set of movie-level graphics and narrative, resources must continue to tilt towards the most prominent parts of the game, such as the sense of impact, the sense of substitution, the audio-visual sensory experience, etc. to improve the quality of the game in all aspects. On the contrary, some of the gameplay and mechanics have not improved with the development of the game. Such games are like a production line, one generation after another. For most players, it may just be that the graphics and actions are more realistic, and the map is larger. The old games of the past, although the game content is not so close to reality, but because of this, the excellent old games that have been passed down are more purely because of their advanced core gameplay, which is addictive.</p>
<p>Therefore, when facing countless masterpieces, players will unconsciously feel that they want to play every game, but they don’t want to click on any game, or they want to turn it off and scroll through their phone after playing for 40 minutes. However, playing the “nostalgic” remake with a nostalgic mentality is so fond of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F22245a29-6bbe-448f-a70a-a4bfed210737.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely"><a href="#3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely" class="headerlink" title="3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely"></a>3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely</h2><p>“Fun, not necessarily long-lasting”, best describes the state of this type of nostalgic game. For players, their happy experience of this type of game may only be 2 hours.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the game has the feeling of playing through arcade games before, but it cannot provide enough motivation for repeated play. Even if each level is made to feel uniquely “new”, due to the repetitive mechanism, if you play more than 10 levels in a row, you will still feel tired.</p>
<p>When players play, they may lose interest after playing two levels with different characters, and the gameplay lacks stamina. If you try to solve the problem of repeated play motivation through the plot, such as branch plot drive, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> does not even have a decent main plot, and it is difficult for players to have the motivation to repeatedly play levels.</p>
<p>However, if you want to continue to get game fun, the ideal situation is to play multiplayer online with friends you know in real life. Combined with the original intention of game development, multiplayer online can also better reproduce the feeling of playing happily with friends in the living room, arcade hall and other places when you were a child. This may be the best and most correct way to open <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. Once you can’t find friends to play with, after playing a few times with random matches, you may still quickly lose motivation due to the aforementioned factors.</p>
<p>Back to what was said at the beginning, nostalgia is good business. It’s okay to make nostalgic games. What is really difficult to reproduce is the days of playing games in the past.</p>

<p>With the improvement of living standards and changes in consumption habits, games have gradually become the mainstream leisure method and social activity for consumers. In 2021, the actual sales revenue of China’s game market was 296.513 billion yuan, an increase of 17.826 billion yuan compared with the previous year, but the growth rate decreased by nearly 15% year-on-year. Affected by the epidemic and the global economy, China’s consumer confidence index has fluctuated significantly in the past two years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fcbebdcf1-16cb-4445-9179-de9a6576e2e7.png/size" alt="China&#39;s Consumer Confidence Index - Recent 10 Years"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fa2a3255f-0714-44f4-a419-fb6dda1f6280.png/size/"></p>
<p>In terms of game payment, the current game market in China presents the characteristics of “low payment rate and high payment amount”. In 2021, the number of game users in China was 666 million, a year-on-year increase of 0.22%, and the number of users is gradually saturated. The penetration rate of mobile game users reached a peak of 75.9% in 2016. Due to policy tightening and other entertainment methods such as short videos grabbing potential game users, it fell to 66.3% in 2020. </p>

<p>Young people, mainly Generation Z, will gradually become the mainstream group of game consumption. “Pursuing fashion”, “expressing self-personality” and “focusing on emotions” are all their consumption labels. To sum up, there are four obvious characteristics of the consumption upgrade phenomenon of young consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the “low-desire society”, consumption is polarized: rationalization of rigid demand and high frequency of spiritual demand;</li>
<li>Consumption upgrade enters the 2.0 era: from material consumption upgrade to spiritual consumption upgrade, users are more likely to be touched by feelings and pay for the spiritual world; pursue refinement and aesthetics; improve their own literacy through consumption, etc.;</li>
<li>Cultural belonging and national trend identity are increasingly prominent</li>
<li>Consumption circles in urban and rural areas and between generations are increasingly solidifie.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F9a2a7d35-d446-4076-a038-776b459453ce.png/size/" alt="Generation Z Online Consumption Survey (Have you ever had the following payment behaviors)"></p>
<p>The consumption upgrade characteristics presented by this new consumer group will also lead the trend of changes in the game industry, including changes in game pricing power (consumption is tilted towards high-quality game products, paying more attention to the multi-dimensional and deep-level added value brought by the product such as experience, feeling, and atmosphere), changes in game mode (“content + form” games and strong rule games with storylines as the main body), changes in integration paths (“game +” and “+ game” forms) and changes in experience methods (breakthrough of circle layers and fragmented time game collaboration).</p>
<p>In other words, the current demographic dividend of the domestic game industry has receded, but in the future, with the increase in China’s per capita disposable income and the strengthening of young people’s willingness to pay for online entertainment, the industry’s payment rate still has a large room for improvement. Next, this article will start from the perspective of consumer psychology to talk about why you are willing to pay in the game, and what factors will affect your payment decision.</p>
<h2 id="1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention"><a href="#1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention" class="headerlink" title="1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention"></a>1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention</h2><p>Consumer psychology mainly studies the psychological phenomena and behavior patterns of consumers in consumption activities. Simply put, consumer action &#x3D; consumer psychology + consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Common consumer psychology includes seeking practicality (the use value of goods &amp; services), seeking beauty (the artistic value and appreciation value of goods), seeking convenience (convenient to buy or carry), comparison (satisfying curiosity and not falling behind), herd mentality and so on.</p>
<p>Purchase intention is the possibility that consumers will buy a certain product or service, and the probability of being willing to take a specific purchase behavior is high or low. It is the subjective tendency of consumers to choose a specific product, and it is an important indicator for predicting consumer behavior. Factors that affect purchase intention are often:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer personality characteristics:</strong> including demographics (gender&#x2F;age&#x2F;occupation&#x2F;income&#x2F;education level) and specific factors (such as the purchase intention of food is related to the consumer’s health status);</li>
<li><strong>Product internal cues:</strong> attributes related to the use value of the product, such as use value, quality characteristics, etc. That is, consumers are to obtain the products they need to meet their own needs, which is the main driving force for consumers to take purchasing behavior;</li>
<li><strong>Product external cues:</strong> relative to internal cues, external factors unrelated to the product’s own attributes, such as price, brand, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Consumption situation factors:</strong> Consumers’ purchasing decisions will change with changes in the situation factors they are in, such as store design, surrounding environment, salesperson performance, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> When the level of purchasing power is constant, market demand is a function of purchase intention. From a macroeconomic perspective, the lack of purchase intention of residents within a certain period of time is due to the decline in the growth of residents’ immediate income and expected income.</li>
</ul>
<p>For consumers, the purchase decision is usually a progressive thinking: whether it can meet my needs, whether I have enough money to buy, and whether it is affordable among similar choices.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the real economy &amp; e-commerce, there are many common situations related to consumer behavior and psychology.</p>
<h3 id="Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’"><a href="#Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’" class="headerlink" title="Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’"></a>Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’</h3><p>When making decisions, consumers rarely buy directly without comparison. At this time, in order for consumers to make purchase decisions better and faster, merchants often provide a “decoy” for the target product to encourage consumers to buy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Ff4a929d9-dd36-4e18-b194-97ad2ba2b8c7.png/size/"></p>

If users don’t understand your product, or a particular feature, they won’t choose it. If you want to design a mall gift package for the game, you need to give players a full understanding, especially for those new players who are just starting to experience the game, what props they can get in the gift package, and what price advantages they have, need to be fully described.</p>
<h3 id="Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props"><a href="#Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props" class="headerlink" title="Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props"></a>Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props</h3><p>When people make judgments about something&#x2F;someone, they are easily dominated by first impressions or the first information they receive, just like an anchor sinking to the bottom of the sea, fixing people’s thoughts somewhere. For example, if a consumer sees the price of a certain product for the first time, then the price of this first impression will have a huge impact on her.</p>
<p>In the game, the pricing of the mall often plays the role of “anchor”. Perhaps the sales of direct purchases in the mall are not high, but when the event gift package is launched, players will compare the price in the gift package with the mall pricing, thus feeling cheap and affordable.</p>
<h2 id="2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation"><a href="#2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation"></a>2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation</h2><p>Currently, more and more people believe that games are closer to a service industry. Players experience the game, in fact, they are enjoying the service content designed by the game developers and paying for it. Not only the game play design itself, its social atmosphere, operation mode, and economic system are all part of the player’s evaluation. With the weakening and disappearance of the demographic dividend, the game industry has turned to competition for existing players. Doing a good job in the game and doing a good job in experience is also more important for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>To understand players’ payment motivation, we can start by understanding players’ game motivation. Many organizations and individuals have studied players’ game motivation, mainly out of personal self-satisfaction, social needs, etc. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F5b51d3f6-b095-41b8-ba47-31e534eed36c.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In order to meet the game needs of different types of players, the paid content in the game has become increasingly diverse, and players with different motivations can find the one that suits their needs in the game. For example, players whose main game motivation is “achievement” are more likely to pay to achieve the goals of the achievement&#x2F;collection system; players who value “social” have a greater willingness to buy appearance items; players who want to “crush others” are more interested in ability-enhancing paid content.</p>
<h2 id="3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment"><a href="#3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment" class="headerlink" title="3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment"></a>3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment</h2><p>Game products can be divided into hardware products (game consoles, accessories, etc.) and software products (online games, mobile games, etc.). Here, we will mainly discuss game software products, especially the payment design in non-buyout games, that is, the payment content related to the game itself.</p>
<p>Games are no longer a “one-shot deal”. Paying attention to the player’s full-process experience in the game, putting users first, and improving user experience are one of the tenets of most game manufacturers. Combining factors such as game motivation, game design, and consumer psychology, we can also extract some factors that may affect players’ payment in the game, so as to better understand why players choose to pay in the game, and what kind of game experience they hope to obtain through payment. In addition to the theme characteristics of players (gender, age, education, etc.), the following factors are worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment"><a href="#Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment" class="headerlink" title="Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment"></a>Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment</h3><p>In an analysis of the online game consumption behavior of college players, researchers found that “entertainment and sociality” is the biggest influencing factor. Players are eager to make new friends, maintain and deepen existing friendships while enjoying online games. At the same time, they hope to gain a sense of existence and achievement that cannot be satisfied in the real world through self-participation.</p>
<p>In addition, players also hope that the game can entertain themselves and relieve pressure. They hope to express themselves through better dressing&#x2F;strength, or show their economic strength and attract attention.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Practical-Value"><a href="#In-Game-Practical-Value" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Practical Value"></a>In-Game Practical Value</h3><p>Most in-game paid content has practical value in the game, such as improving character abilities, saving game time, accumulating game resources, facilitating certain game activities, helping to complete certain tasks, etc. For these reasons, players may take payment actions.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Quality-Itself"><a href="#Game-Quality-Itself" class="headerlink" title="Game Quality Itself"></a>Game Quality Itself</h3><p>According to the statistics of Gamma Data, among the top 250 games in China in 2019, only 15.3% were “obviously innovative” types, but they contributed 62.3% of the total revenue of these games. Chinese players are obviously more willing to pay for games with excellent graphics and innovative gameplay. With the tightening of policies, some homogenous games with ordinary graphics, monotonous content and gameplay, and short player life cycle value will gradually disappear. The increase in the proportion of high-quality games will hopefully drive the overall ARPU value of the industry.</p>
<p><em>ARPU, that is, average revenue per user, is an indicator used by operators to measure the revenue from each end user.</em></p>
<p>Whether the game is innovative and refined enough (including picture quality, gameplay content, story theme, game style, plot characters, etc.), whether it is easy to get started, and whether the quality of related services is timely and effective will affect players’ payment decisions.</p>
<h3 id="External-Market-Impact"><a href="#External-Market-Impact" class="headerlink" title="External Market Impact"></a>External Market Impact</h3><p>The game industry is not operating independently. Players also pay attention to the legal and policy environment, such as the anti-addiction regulations for minors that manufacturers have been working to optimize in recent years; marketing such as celebrity effects, IP linkage, etc.; and hardware configuration, players’ network speed, and the dependence of game products on device configuration.</p>
<h3 id="Consumption-Preferences"><a href="#Consumption-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Consumption Preferences"></a>Consumption Preferences</h3><p>Game payment is no different from other payment behaviors. As consumers, players will first consider the economic value of their content: whether the price is affordable, whether it is reasonable, and whether it is affordable; some game prop content also has a certain ‘investment value’, and players consider whether they can sell it at a higher price in the future; there will also be some players who regard game payment as ‘one of the necessary game processes’.</p>
<h3 id="Other-Payment-Experiences"><a href="#Other-Payment-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Other Payment Experiences"></a>Other Payment Experiences</h3><p>Game payment can also learn from the experience of e-commerce payment. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of website speed (purchase process): As long as the waiting time exceeds three seconds, 57% of consumers will give up browsing the webpage, and 80% of consumers will not return to the website;</li>
<li>Overall website design (payment design UI): 92.6% of consumers said that visual enjoyment is the main factor affecting purchasing decisions, and they will decide whether to consume in just 1 and a half minutes;</li>
<li>Price discrimination: In the口碑崩盘 (kǒu bēi bēng pán - reputation collapse) incident encountered by the game “Invisible Guardian”, “inconsistent pricing” triggered a lot of negative reviews from players.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F897199a2-e97a-45c3-8c3b-13f3567b59e7.png/size/" alt="Selected Reviews of &quot;Invisible Guardian&quot; - Steam Version"></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In general, paying in a game is not a one-way request, but providing high-quality services to meet the needs of players. Game as a Service (GAAS) on the one hand means that the game is no longer a one-time purchase for consumers, but a longer-term participation, and it is a commitment by game developers to provide players with continuous operation and continuous updates; on the other hand, it also requires developers to pay attention to the full-process and all-round experience of players in the game journey, and continuously polish products with the goal of “providing a better game user experience”.</p>

    <title>How to Read Minds Through the Eyes Using Eye Tracking in Game Research</title>
    <url>/2022/08/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20221128_28584_1055096/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221128/28584_1055096.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In user research, researchers often encounter this situation: a player, after experiencing a process, cannot answer any questions during the follow-up interview: Was there this feature? Did I perform this operation? Why did I do this at that time? Whenever this happens, researchers feel a tinge of helplessness, wishing they could read minds at this moment.</p>
<p>Once players forget details, making it impossible to describe their behavior, the problems observed by the user researcher may not be solved. Fortunately, eye-tracking testing, as an objective measurement method, can measure players’ pure experience responses, supplement players’ physiological response data, and combine with traditional subjective research, which can, to a certain extent, avoid some biases caused by players’ subjective feedback. So, from the perspective of user research practice, how can visual attention data be applied to product design and user experience research?</p>
<h2 id="1-Principles-and-Characteristics-of-Eye-Movement"><a href="#1-Principles-and-Characteristics-of-Eye-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1. Principles and Characteristics of Eye Movement"></a>1. Principles and Characteristics of Eye Movement</h2><h3 id="Player-Attention-Distribution-Can-Be-Derived-from-Gaze-Point-Movement-Data"><a href="#Player-Attention-Distribution-Can-Be-Derived-from-Gaze-Point-Movement-Data" class="headerlink" title="Player Attention Distribution Can Be Derived from Gaze Point Movement Data"></a>Player Attention Distribution Can Be Derived from Gaze Point Movement Data</h3><p>Eye Movement is the process of the eyeball discovering, fixating, and tracking visual stimuli through movement. Eye tracking, which sounds very sophisticated, from observing the player’s eyes to reading the player’s mind, can actually be understood in two steps:</p>
<p>First, the prompt is right in front of you, where exactly are they looking? In other words, how do we measure the player’s eye movements?</p>
<p>The answer is Gaze Point. Modern eye-tracking instruments can calculate the movement of the eyeball through infrared light reflection, and we can see in real time where the player’s gaze point is and what they are looking at. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F4ec35219-213f-4253-9c28-66dad0d2c908.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Schematic Diagram of Eye Movement Gaze Point</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Second, they clearly saw the prompt, where is their attention actually?</p>
<p>In fact, the player’s eye movements and their attention distribution are closely related. By observing eye movement trajectories and behaviors, we can还原(huányuán - restore, reconstruct) the reasons why players did not operate in time, such as more urgent incentives (monsters rushing towards them, pickups not far away).</p>
<p>Simply put, eye tracking is to display the test subject’s gaze point on the screen in real time, and present this performance in the form of data afterwards; researchers or products can intuitively understand what information the test subject looked at, what they didn’t look at, how long they looked at a certain piece of information, etc. It can be used as direct evidence for interface and prompt optimization.</p>
<h3 id="Eye-Movement-Research-Can-Supplement-Objective-Behavioral-Data"><a href="#Eye-Movement-Research-Can-Supplement-Objective-Behavioral-Data" class="headerlink" title="Eye Movement Research Can Supplement Objective Behavioral Data"></a>Eye Movement Research Can Supplement Objective Behavioral Data</h3><p>At first glance, eye movement seems to be able to obtain a lot of detailed data, but what are its advantages or differences compared with commonly used research methods? As a kind of behavioral data measured by technology, eye movement can solve the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The reading cost of measurement results is too high:</strong> Eye movement data can be intuitively presented with a heat map, which greatly reduces the reading cost of the original data, and even people who have not been exposed to eye movement can easily read it;</li>
<li><strong>Players subjectively speculate on behavioral details:</strong> Through eye movement data, the situation where players recall and explain specific details is avoided, preventing players from hypothesizing details afterwards;</li>
<li><strong>The experimenter needs to frequently interrupt the process:</strong> Using other methods, the experimenter may need to frequently interrupt the player to ask for details of the experience, while eye movement can ensure that the player is tested without interference, especially suitable for scenarios that emphasize immersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The limitations of eye movement are also very obvious - in essence, eye movement obtains behavioral data and cannot provide explanatory information about the cause of player behavior. In order to understand the complete link of players’ “behavior-eye movement-motivation-cause”, it is often necessary to add post-test follow-up, ask players’ subjective attitudes and experience, and supplement with demographic characteristics and related experience, in order to obtain relatively complete research insights.</p>
<h2 id="2-Commonly-Used-Eye-Movement-Indicators-in-Practical-Applications"><a href="#2-Commonly-Used-Eye-Movement-Indicators-in-Practical-Applications" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly Used Eye Movement Indicators in Practical Applications"></a>2. Commonly Used Eye Movement Indicators in Practical Applications</h2><p>As mentioned above, the data obtained by eye movement methods has a very high granularity and is very comprehensive, and various types of analysis can be realized according to the needs of researchers. In user research practice, there are three types of data that are frequently used (taking Tobii Pro Lab analysis software as an example):</p>
<h3 id="Eye-Movement-Video-High-Analysis-Efficiency-Can-Discover-More-Than-80-of-Problems"><a href="#Eye-Movement-Video-High-Analysis-Efficiency-Can-Discover-More-Than-80-of-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Eye Movement Video: High Analysis Efficiency, Can Discover More Than 80% of Problems"></a>Eye Movement Video: High Analysis Efficiency, Can Discover More Than 80% of Problems</h3><p>Eye movement video is a screen recording of the player’s experience process + the player’s real-time eye movement gaze point data. Through the software, researchers can clearly see the landing point of each gaze of the player. By watching the video, researchers can restore the changes in the player’s attention at any time during the test, which is the simplest and most efficient way of eye movement indicators. In specific use, researchers can see: where the player looked, where they didn’t look, what content they were more concerned about, and the order of attention.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, when a player was experiencing the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> novice tutorial, because of personal operation, they did not see the AR prompt text, resulting in not using the “Sprint” button for a long time. The eye movement video allows the experimenter to intuitively identify that the player did not operate as expected here, and focus on the impact caused by this in the subsequent game process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F5b6ab7a3-9576-478e-8a46-be80c6b4fc92.gif/size/"></p>

The longer (more times) the player gazes, the more it is displayed as red on the heat map, emphasizing the overall situation and relative density of attention. The gaze plot can show the order and trajectory of all the player’s gaze points. This indicator is mainly used for the verification of existing interface design, and the usage scenario is usually to study relatively static area combinations. </p>

<p>For example, in the picture above, when observing the player’s understanding of the merchant tutorial, it can be seen from the heat map that the player pays extra attention to the merchant sign on the map (the red highlighted area in the picture above), and from the trajectory map, it can be seen that the player looks at the text and video对照(duìzhào - in comparison) (the numbers of the gaze points in the figure below).</p>
<h3 id="Quantitative-Indicators-Time-to-First-Fixation-and-Fixation-Duration-are-Most-Commonly-Used"><a href="#Quantitative-Indicators-Time-to-First-Fixation-and-Fixation-Duration-are-Most-Commonly-Used" class="headerlink" title="Quantitative Indicators - Time to First Fixation and Fixation Duration are Most Commonly Used"></a>Quantitative Indicators - Time to First Fixation and Fixation Duration are Most Commonly Used</h3><p>Quantitative indicators can be exported through software, and the obtainable indicator data is divided into Fixation, Visit, Saccade and other series of data. These indicators are often used for quantitative user behavior research. If necessary, the most commonly used and easy-to-use ones are the following two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixation Duration:</strong> That is, the duration of the player’s gaze within a certain period of time. It is generally understood as the player’s degree of interest. The longer the fixation duration, the more interested the player is in the corresponding position.</li>
<li><strong>Time to First Fixation:</strong> That is, the time when the first fixation occurs. It can be seen whether the player pays attention to the content in the first place and the time spent. According to the time to first fixation, we can analyze the cause of the player’s time consumption, the distribution of stimulation points, etc., so as to adjust the prompt position, intensity and other related UI design elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above three types of indicators have their own focus and can complement each other. The recommended analysis method is: first watch the eye movement video to find possible problems; then use heat maps and gaze plots to visually compare specific problems; if necessary, in-depth analysis can be carried out through quantitative data.</p>

Combining player behavior, eye movement, and interface information can reveal problems.</p>
<p>The following is a player experiencing the novice tutorial of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on console. After defeating the enemy, the player does not know what to do, walks around randomly for a period of time, suddenly releases the Y skill once, and then enters the next stage. Through eye movement, we can find that in this stage, the player only sees the prompt requirement in the upper left corner of the screen at the end, resulting in not achieving the task goal and getting stuck. From this, we can judge that this player did not find the task prompt in the first place as expected, and the researcher may need to further verify the existing UI design for repeated testing. </p>

<p>For example, in the eye-tracking test of the mobile game <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword</em>, experienced players are familiar with the game UI and task flow, so their eye movement trajectory can be used as a reference for players in use. Comparing it with the eye movement of new players, we can find the difference in attention between novices and experienced players. </p>

<p><em>《Meteor Butterfly Sword》 Mobile Game Novice&#x2F;Experienced Player Battle Level Three-Star Task Eye Movement Heat Map and Table</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It can be seen from the eye movement data (the numbers in the figure below indicate the number of fixations (time to first fixation)) that experienced players will pay attention to the requirements of the three-star task from the beginning, while novices do not pay attention to it throughout the process; experienced players pay attention to it, indicating that this is a relatively important goal when clearing the level, while new players do not see it, indicating that the information is not conspicuous enough when used for the first time. By comparing the focus of new and experienced players, it is helpful for the product to adjust the problems in terms of player onboarding.</p>
<h3 id="Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Materials"><a href="#Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Comparative Analysis Through Different Materials"></a>Comparative Analysis Through Different Materials</h3><p>We can also discover the similarities and differences in player behavior through the comparative analysis of different materials. This method can be used for the comparison of similar processes.</p>
<p>Taking the video teaching in the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> novice tutorial as an example, players will experience the “Merchant” and “Whirlwind” tutorials (both of which are in the form of text + dynamic video). A certain player showed that he carefully watched the previous video, but did not pay attention to the latter video at all, but the final result was the same - the player’s actual operation was very smooth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F3dbafbc2-ae68-4b3d-8473-1244358a8acd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Gaze Plot - Merchant Tutorial (Left) and Whirlwind Tutorial (Right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Why does this happen? Through the player’s attention to the content of the page, we found that in the Whirlwind tutorial, there is a description of the display content of the small map, and the player does not need to watch the video to know the approximate style of the icon; while in the Merchant tutorial, the text description does not prompt the icon style, which leads to the above eye movement behavior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fdc3817c1-e657-496c-aeee-abee839dd166.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F2612aebe-9ad1-4d89-9922-8c767a478da0.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Eye movement is behavioral data, which can complement traditional interviews. Through eye movement videos, visualizations, etc., researchers can accurately and meticulously identify and analyze problems. Eye tracking can not only be used directly for analysis, but also can be combined with experimental design for targeted exploration.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, eye tracking, like other user experience research methods, requires a clear research plan, reasonable and measurable assumptions for the problems to be explored, and targeted player interviews after the test, in order to draw convincing conclusions and form inspiring insights. In user research work, any technical means are only auxiliary. Understanding the player’s motivation, needs, and cognitive process, experiencing and understanding with empathy, is the so-called “mind reading”.</p>

<h2 id="1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games"></a>1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games</h2><p>“Red dot notifications,” as a simple and eye-catching reminder, are ubiquitous on today’s smart device platforms. It can attract everyone’s attention with a strong visual presentation in the interface, convey the content of the prompt information, especially in the multi-level menu jump, it can also clearly guide the user, and it is the key to attracting users to obtain information. It can be seen that the role of the little red dot is self-evident. There is a big role hidden in the small red dot. In fact, “little red dot” is our popular and vivid term, and its official name is “Badge.” So, what is a badge?</p>
<p>A badge refers to a red dot, number, or text that usually appears in the upper right corner of an icon or text, indicating that there is new content or information to be processed. Its purpose is to guide users to operate and increase clicks, thereby increasing business exposure. A small number of red dots can provide effective information prompts for everyone, but when red dots appear all over the screen, it will become a disaster for obsessive-compulsives.</p>
<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones"></a>Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones</h3><p>There are many theories about the origin of the little red dot badge, but the most widely accepted theory is that the badge originated from the BlackBerry mobile phone system. In 2009, in the 9700 series mobile phones launched by BlackBerry, a small red dot with an asterisk (*) appeared in its system. Later, in 2013, Apple used the small red dot in its system and registered related patents. Since then, the small red dot has been carried forward in the iPhone. Later, the Android system also adopted the visual presentation of the “little red dot”. Until today, we have become accustomed to the appearance of the little red dot. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fec95d72c-1d82-4e54-ad14-c11aeacc7017.png/size/" alt="BlackBerry 9700 Series Phone"></p>
<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Games"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Games"></a>Little Red Dots in Games</h3><p>In games, in order to effectively remind players to pay attention to function activation, content updates, reward collection, mail notifications, and other information, game developers are also very fond of small red dots, wishing that the interface was full of red dots. Even for players, playing games every day is to regularly clear the refreshed small red dots.</p>
<p>Of course, in the game, the more red dots, the better. If red dots appear all over the screen, it will make players feel confused, unable to distinguish the importance of the information conveyed, and confused. It will also strongly force players to eliminate a large number of red dots, causing players to be bored and reducing the game experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F8fee83ee-bf20-4e3b-bf32-47ec0a30f587.png/size/" alt="Onmyoji Game Interface"><br><em>《Onmyoji》 Mobile Game Interface</em></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot"><a href="#2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot" class="headerlink" title="2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot"></a>2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot</h2><h3 id="From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?"></a>From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?</h3><p>The eye-catching way of the small red dot can undoubtedly quickly attract the attention of players. From the perspective of the game itself, it can not only effectively improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition, but also guide players to perform expected behaviors. For players, the appearance of the small red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, and the “discomfort” it brings will greatly attract players and induce them to click to eliminate the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reminder and attraction:</strong> Improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition</p>
<ul>
<li>In the game, the use of small red dots is mainly for reminders and attraction. Reminders refer to promptly delivering new messages, gameplays, updates, and other information in the game to players, allowing players to obtain new mail information, notifications, discover new costumes, skills, equipment, attributes, and other content. Attraction is to further guide players to click to increase clicks and exposure on the basis of basic reminder functions.</li>
<li>At the same time, because players’ game time is becoming more and more fragmented, developers must provide players with more convenient ways to use small red dots to allow players to obtain more content within a limited time, reducing invalid exploration and searching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Guidance and expectation:</strong> Guide players to perform expected behavior operations</p>
<ul>
<li>Another important role of the small red dot is to guide players to perform expected behavior operations. In the game, if the guidance is done well, it can allow players to obtain a smooth experience, but if it is not done well, it will make players feel bored and irritable. For example, in the hero interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a “plus sign” shaped red badge is used in the upper right corner of each hero to allow players to click to view new heroes and updated costumes, equipment, etc. of heroes, guiding players to click step by step to view updated content and understand the details of items. After the player clicks to view, the red dot will disappear, which can effectively guide the player to obtain information, and also clear the “red dot” in time, so that the player has a clear and smooth experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?"></a>From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?</h3><p>From the player’s point of view, why do players always can’t help but click on the little red dot?</p>
<p>This is mainly because the appearance of the red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, distinguishing and enhancing the primary and secondary relationship of information. At the same time, it brings players the discomfort of breaking the stability, so it will force players to “deal” with the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Break the balance of information transmission</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The principle of similarity mentions that objects with common elements appear to be more related, usually manifested as visual elements such as shape, color, and size. We also tend to regard similar objects as a group when observing things. When there is no small red dot in the normal state, the information is in equilibrium. The appearance of the small red dot makes it different from other content in the group, breaking the original information balance, efficiently presenting information to players, and allowing players to quickly obtain information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bring “discomfort” to players</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of small red dots in the game can be said to take advantage of the player’s obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology. When there is disharmony, abnormality, and other content in the interface, it will make players feel bored, and they will try to clear and correct these “errors”. The “discomfort” brought to players will greatly attract players, making them actively click to eliminate it, and also complete the game guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?"></a>3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?</h2><p>After understanding the origin and role of the little red dot, we will next explore how to better design and utilize the little red dot in the game interface to provide players with an efficient, smooth, and comfortable experience.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Excessive-Appearance"><a href="#Reduce-Excessive-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Excessive Appearance"></a>Reduce Excessive Appearance</h3><p>The little red dot is not a panacea. When there are many small red dots in the interface, the red dot loses its original meaning. Red dots all over the screen will make players confused. Perhaps some players will click on them one by one under the guidance of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but more players will choose to ignore the existence of red dots, and even feel disgusted. Therefore, the excessive appearance of red dots should be reduced in the interface, the number of displays should be controlled, and key information should be selected for prompting, so that the small red dot can show its due value.</p>
<h3 id="One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate"><a href="#One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate" class="headerlink" title="One-time and Easy to Eliminate"></a>One-time and Easy to Eliminate</h3><p>Many players encounter situations in the game where they cannot eliminate the small red dot, which will cause them to feel extremely irritable. Therefore, in the design, players need to be able to easily eliminate the red dot and make it disappear with a simple operation, restoring a concise and refreshing interface. In some games, this is ignored, and the red dot that is always on will greatly affect the player’s game experience. The red dot elimination principle should meet the following 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-time reminder, disappears after clicking</li>
<li>Click to disappear, reset after re-login</li>
<li>Can be cleared when conditions are met</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path"><a href="#Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path" class="headerlink" title="Ensure a Clear Guidance Path"></a>Ensure a Clear Guidance Path</h3><p>When there are new content updates or reminders for players to collect rewards, it is necessary to use red dots to attract players and guide them to the final page. In the process, if there is a guidance break or a sudden stop, it will cause players to be confused. Therefore, when using small red dots, it is necessary to ensure the clarity of the guidance path. For example, in the reward collection guidance of <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, the appearance of red dots well guides the reward collection path. When the player enters the final page, the red dot disappears, and the collection of the gift package is displayed in the form of special effects. When the player takes the wrong path, the red dot will appear again to correct the player’s path. </p>

<h3 id="Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style"><a href="#Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style" class="headerlink" title="Performance in Line with the Game Style"></a>Performance in Line with the Game Style</h3><p>In the game, the appearance of the small red dot provides players with clear information reminders, but in different scenes, the form of the small red dot should also be different. Of course, no matter what form it appears in, it should have a strong visual effect. In the design, it should also be considered comprehensively from three aspects: color, shape, and form of expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Not just red<ul>
<li>Usually, the appearance of small red dots is mainly red. This is because red will give people a sense of warning, danger, and eye-catching, and it can form a strong contrast with other information, thereby attracting players’ attention. Therefore, designing small red dots in red can well attract players to click.</li>
<li>Of course, in games, due to the different styles and theme colors of different games, the use of “small red dots” can also be flexibly designed. For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the theme color of the game is mainly yellow, so in order to fit the theme color, yellow is also used in the design of the “small red dot”. At the same time, the bright yellow can also attract the attention of players.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Diverse styles<ul>
<li>Also in the choice of shape, especially in games, it is not limited to circles. In the design of the shape, it can be set according to the worldview and style of the game itself, making the interface more holistic. For example, the “small red dot” in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> adopts a pentagonal design, which is selected from the packaging of candies in the original work; the “small red dot” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> adopts the form of a “+” to indicate update reminders; in <em>Onmyoji</em>, although the red dot method is also used, its shape is integrated with the game style, and it is also more unified in the interface.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F5068f15f-511b-4687-b409-a68f735b195b.png/size/" alt="Harry Potter: Magic Awakened &#x2F; Naraka: Bladepoint &#x2F; Onmyoji"></p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form of expression:</strong> Vivid and image<ul>
<li>In terms of expression, the shape of the small red dot can also be more vivid and image. The combination of pictures and text, the presentation of text, and the performance of micro-motion effects can all enrich the style of the “small red dot”. For example, in <em>UNO!</em>, the small red dot becomes the form of a bubble, and an exclamation mark is displayed in it to indicate information reminders, which can easily attract the attention of players; in the <em>Onmyoji</em> store, the text form is directly used as a badge, which also effectively conveys new information; in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, the friend badge adopts the form of mail and is presented in the form of micro-dynamic shaking, which can also vividly display the reminder information in front of the player, thereby attracting the player to click. The diverse forms of expression make the “small red dot” more emotional and interesting, and it is also easier to bring players a pleasant experience.</li>

<h3 id="Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click"><a href="#Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click" class="headerlink" title="Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click"></a>Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click</h3><p>In the game, in order to allow players to get a good experience, the function design that allows players to eliminate red dot prompts with one click can be described as a boon for obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. In the interactive interface, you can design an interactive button to eliminate red dot prompts in a more conspicuous position, or you can put it in the settings for players to choose the red dot message reminders that need to be eliminated. One-click elimination of red dot prompts is not to close it once and for all, cutting off players’ reminders to get messages, but to provide players with more choices, slow down players’ irritability experience, and red dot prompts will also appear again after re-login to the game (but one-click elimination will also inevitably bring some mistakes).</p>
<p>Of course, when designing the interaction of the one-click elimination button, it can also be more interesting. For example, as early as 2014, QQ added the “drag and disappear” interaction method to eliminate red dots, which is both convenient and interesting, and at the same time can avoid the embarrassment caused by one-click elimination.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, the little red dot has become an effective way of information reminders in the game. Although different forms will be adopted in different functions and usage scenarios, the design of small red dots in games should be more efficient and friendly, effectively reminding players to obtain information. It should not appear casually in order to cope or excessively highlight certain information, which will eventually lead to the proliferation of red dots, causing confusion to players and affecting the player’s game experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, when designing the “little red dot”, you should also consider the necessity of the appearance of the red dot, as well as the consistent form of expression with the game style, and increase the fun of the “little red dot” dynamic effect performance in appropriate circumstances, so that the small red dot can play a big role, truly and efficiently transmit information for players, and reduce players’ boredom with the “red dot”.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do we love playing games? Because they provide us with the opportunity to satisfy our inner psychological needs. For MMORPG players, satisfying social needs is an important factor that drives them to the virtual world. In the joyful world of resolving grudges with a smile, we can choose to play completely different roles and interact with others. “Being yourself” or “no longer being yourself” are both choices. And the premise of “playing” is “personalization.” Fashion appearance is one of the most direct personalization systems in the game.</p>
<p>How players dress up their characters is also a part of self-expression in social interaction. Therefore, players’ needs for fashion appearances in the game may also reflect their expectations for the image presented by the characters they control in social interaction. So, in MMO games, what is the relationship between players’ choices of fashion appearances and players’ self-expression in the virtual world?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”"><a href="#1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”" class="headerlink" title="1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”"></a>1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”</h2><p>With the iteration of the overall quality of games, the character images in MMO games are becoming more and more refined and beautiful. Players also have more methods and channels to pursue beauty and individuality. For example, in <em>Revelation M</em>, players can customize the colors and patterns of certain fashions, presenting different styles with the same tailoring and design through their own thinking. Players can also trade in the store and earn income by selling their creations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F97b2e81d-dc33-488f-b057-f28ad9b9e020.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fb85982d2-cb08-4bac-bbc9-8e3826f32a12.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Revelation M’s Stylist System (top) and Player Styling Store (bottom)</em></p>

<p>In such a highly free customization system, some players have begun to pursue another extreme of aesthetics (as shown below). The left side is created by players through dyeing and printing on the basis of the clothing on the right side. Why do players pursue to emulate the “Shamate” (杀马特 - shā mǎ tè, a Chinese subculture known for its extravagant and often garish fashion) style, and even take photos and share them. </p>

<p><em>Player-customized Shamate style (left) and the corresponding original clothing (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Because the “Shamate” style does not mean that players lack aesthetics, but is a way for some players to pursue social recognition.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, personalization is an important prerequisite for social interaction. In <em>Revelation M</em>, where even NPCs are handsome men and beautiful women, “good-looking” does have a thousand faces. But when everyone is as beautiful as a banished immortal, the extreme <em>tuwei</em> (土味 - tǔ wèi, meaning “rustic” or “tacky”) is more eye-catching and more impressive. This kind of behavior is no different from the pursuit of “riding a server-limited mount and swaggering through the streets”. Both are self-expression in social interaction. The only difference is that the former tries to seek recognition by showing personality, because such a dress conveys the message “I am very interesting, I have a personality”.</p>
<p>In fact, after the aesthetic significance is greatly reduced, it is not difficult to see that such a dress is completely for social needs, and it may lose its meaning if it is not seen&#x2F;commented on by others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F62121856-dac6-4362-a0c0-e005e664a1e7.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Revelation M players in groups, all dressed in Shamate style</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is worth noting that there is a subtle difference between such personalized customization and what is called “not good-looking”. First, Shamate dress is often high-profile and direct. When customizing fashion in <em>Revelation M</em>, you can adjust the color temperature and hue to make the entire fashion emit fluorescence, announcing at the first time that “this dress is <em>tuwei</em>“. Second, others can see that the Shamate appearance is intentional by the player, and not really a lack of aesthetics. It can be seen that the two players dressed up in the picture above actually put a lot of effort into it. The male character in fluorescent yellow in the picture above needs to adjust the hue and color temperature of all the color blocks on the whole body to be uniform to achieve a harmonious <em>tuwei</em>; while the player on the far left, who dyed and printed each part of the clothing with reference to the “Northeast China floral袄” (dōng běi dà huā ǎo, a traditional Chinese jacket with a bold floral pattern), carefully chose suitable prints and adjusted their positions.</p>
<p>In contrast, players rarely choose appearances like the one below, where it is difficult to tell whether it is “intentional” or “just their aesthetic”, as a symbol of showing off their personality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F2b050c0a-b621-4865-a110-0381325f55c2.jpg/size/"></p>

<p><em>A fashion in Revelation M that has received negative reviews</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”"><a href="#2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”" class="headerlink" title="2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”"></a>2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”</h2><p>Games are a virtual world, and players can choose to play a role that is completely different from themselves, even including gender. In MMO games, it is very common for the player’s gender to be inconsistent with the character’s gender. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F340486c3-3b21-474b-a63f-554e06bdc77e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The character’s appearance, the player’s gender, and his custom tag</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Taking male players as an example, a typical dress for the female characters they control is a fair, youthful, and pure image. For example, in the figure below, the two dresses are from characters controlled by players of different genders. It is not difficult to see that the left picture is a character controlled by a male player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F4cb49cd6-f9ee-4594-b25c-9372d76054ef.png/size/"></p>
<p>If you think about it carefully, the way male players meticulously dress up their characters seems to be no different from girls playing with Barbie dolls in terms of expression. This kind of behavior may be considered by some to be detrimental to traditional masculinity. Similarly, looking at female players, choosing a male character means giving up the exquisitely detailed dresses. Given the high opportunity cost and potential risks, why are players still enjoying choosing opposite-sex characters?</p>
<p>Because when the player’s gender is inconsistent with the character’s gender, the character image is no longer equivalent to the player’s social image in the game, but a projection of personal aesthetics. In other words, at this time, “I am no longer me”, and the player and the character have a subject-object relationship.</p>
<p>Taking the “Ni Su” (逆苏 - nì sū) culture, which has often been mentioned in recent years, as an example, Ni Su, that is, “reverse Mary Sue”, originally meant that in the fan circle, fans gave traditional female qualities to their favorite male artists through secondary creation of materials related to them, reconstructing the gender roles of themselves and the artists, and forming a new dominance relationship. For example, calling a male artist their “wife” is a typical “Ni Su”.</p>
<p>In MMORPGs, some female players also have similar behaviors when manipulating male characters. In their gaming habits, the male characters they manipulate are more like the image of the opposite sex they idealize, and they will dress them up according to their own aesthetics. But in game social interaction, no matter whether the character’s appearance is cold or noble, female players often have distinct personal characteristics. They have no intention of playing “a翩翩公子 (piān piān gōng zǐ, a handsome and elegant young man)”, but comfortably reveal their own personalities as social beings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F2810975e-888f-46fd-9f87-216ee0750737.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>In this case, players have fixed expectations for the characters they manipulate, which contain the player’s own aesthetic preferences. The player’s main consideration is no longer the group’s aesthetic standards, but whether they like it and whether it exceeds their expectations.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”"><a href="#3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”"></a>3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”</h2><p>In the fashion stores of various MMO games, there is always a white fashion that sells very well. “Fairy”, “elegant” and “noble” seem to be eternal keywords. In the research, we found that when players evaluate the aesthetics of fashion, they pay more attention to the temperament shown behind the fashion. In today’s extreme pursuit of personalization, why do many female players have such similar preferences. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F517131d9-1b7b-4591-a65e-41d6e72481a5.png/size/"></p>
<p>Because in the pursuit of white clothes, players also become more “beautiful” people, to ultimately gain public (social) recognition.</p>
<p>Many MMO themes in China are based on various martial arts&#x2F;xianxia masterpieces. Most MMO players are from the 80s&#x2F;90s generation and have been deeply influenced by martial arts writers such as Gu Long and Jin Yong. They have a similar understanding of the events of the <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, the martial arts world), for example, when it comes to the true, good and beautiful female image in the <em>jianghu</em>, there are the following descriptions:</p>
<p><em>“Her appearance is peerless, both beautiful as a fairy and bright and gorgeous, with skin like ice and bones like jade, as pure as a fairy from Gǔyè, with a natural and spiritual beauty; her martial arts are light and elegant, defeating enemies and winning in a graceful and charming way.” “She is upright and bright, broad-minded, and repays grievances with virtue.”</em></p>
<p>The above is Mr. Jin Yong’s description of Xiaolongnü in the original novel “The Return of the Condor Heroes”. In fact, if you read carefully, you will find that these two descriptions do not mention clothing and appearance, but the association given to people is a female image with white clothes and black hair like a waterfall. When the entire group has been influenced by a certain culture, individual aesthetic preferences may also be assimilated.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we have formed a connection between qualities such as “natural and spiritual beauty” and “bright and gorgeous” and concrete features (“white clothes” and “skirts”), because in too many film and television&#x2F;artistic images we have seen, white-clad swordsmen who uphold justice, that is, elegant women in white clothes, are more likely to be recognized by the public. Therefore, a white dress may also be more attractive in the eyes of others, thereby gaining the recognition of others. Of course, this process is not necessarily conscious, that is, players do not necessarily buy to seek recognition, but as a form of self-expression, gaining recognition is one of the influencing factors of personalization.</p>
<p>Does this phenomenon have scalability and practical significance?</p>
<p>In previous contacts with <em>Revelation M</em> players, we classified daily temperaments and confirmed their preferences through player choices. The actual sales of related fashions and players’ preferences for temperament confirmed and expanded the above conclusions: in addition to “fairy white clothes”, some “non-white clothes” appearance designs with “elegant”, “noble” and “classical” temperaments are also very popular with female players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fbd47b52e-80a7-4539-984a-d2fc5ea896ab.png/size/"></p>
<p>In summary, fashions with elegant colors, flowing skirts, and exquisite and atmospheric fabrics are more likely to be favored by female players; at the same time, they need to outline the slender and beautiful limbs of female characters and show a graceful waist. Many players are disgusted with the bloated look (such as thick skirts and sleeves, fluffy fur collars and shawls).</p>
<h2 id="4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”"><a href="#4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”" class="headerlink" title="4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”"></a>4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”</h2><p>In male players’ choices of fashion, there are also such group characteristics. Their sensitivity to fashion details is relatively lower, but many male players have a common demand, that is, the characteristics of fashion cannot have a feminine or charming temperament (i.e., cannot be “effeminate”). Even as society becomes more and more tolerant of male aesthetics, this is still a major minefield in the design of game fashion appearances. Why can’t many male players accept clothes with this kind of temperament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F3b28df6f-712b-4954-9530-2cf1333d8f90.png/size/"></p>
<p>Because while rejecting the “feminine” appearance, male players are also avoiding the possibility of a setback in social status, so as to maintain their dominant position in the group&#x2F;society.</p>
<p>In the traditional gender binary, men and women are given stereotypes in society that are not related to gender itself (“pink is for girls, blue is for boys”). More deeply, the social status of men has been higher than that of women for thousands of years in the past (“three cardinal guides and five constant virtues”). Traditional masculinity has gradually become equated with higher social status in practice. Conversely, having traditional female qualities means “being dominated” and “submissive”. Therefore, for some players, wearing pink fashion is so “disgusting” because it means that traditional male characteristics are dissolved, resulting in the loss of power and status, and they cannot be recognized as men.</p>
<p>In MMO games, when a male player manipulates a male character to wear clothes with traditional female qualities, he is likely to be ridiculed by men and even some women. This is detrimental to the social image, so many male players may consider avoiding such fashions to avoid image frustration.</p>
<p>As a positive example, the “breakout hit” appearance “Jing Hong Yu” (惊鸿羽 - jīng hóng yǔ, meaning “Graceful Feather”) previously launched by <em>Justice Online</em> also confirms this view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fe3d09472-6c23-44fc-8720-f5dcfc1259bf.png/size/"></p>
<p>Launched in 2020, this fashion was a breakthrough in the appearance design of <em>Justice Online</em> - exposing the chest and abdominal muscles of male characters; once launched, this fashion was a double harvest of popularity and sales. In fact, the design of Jing Hong Yu also has the characteristics of large-area exposure and bright colors. But why are its sales so high?</p>
<p>Because the freshness brought by the “design breakthrough” made the overall public opinion at that time tend to be positive, this fashion was considered to be “lined”, “domineering” and “sexy”, and even female players requested to buy it in public opinion. In this scenario, buying Jing Hong Yu does not damage the traditional masculinity, on the contrary, it is another emphasis on the ideal social image of male players. Therefore, male players of <em>Justice Online</em> have passionately placed orders for this fashion that “looks very domineering” and “is liked by young ladies”.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, appearance characteristics that may be considered by players to have traditional female qualities include: bright colors, exposed skin, soft makeup, etc. However, whether it is “effeminate” or not is a very subjective concept, which varies from player group to player group. For example, in the above-mentioned <em>Justice Online</em>, male fashions presented in a V-shape always fail to escape being described as “feminine”. But in <em>Revelation M</em>, players are more tolerant of this type of clothing design. But in any case, as long as the player feedback on a male fashion forms a clear negative public opinion about “wearing it is very effeminate”, the sales of this fashion are likely to decline.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article starts from the choice of fashion appearance by MMO player groups, and analyzes the situation where the choice of fashion is affected by social factors. After being given social significance, players will consider the social image they present in communication when choosing fashion appearances. For example, in order to pursue a higher evaluation, players often choose fashions with features that are generally recognized in the group, such as elegant and ethereal white clothes; to avoid potential risks, such as a setback in social status, male players will avoid choosing appearances with specific designs that may be considered to have a certain temperament.</p>
<p>User and player research will not be a combination of independent characteristics. As individuals, players’ needs, behaviors and habits affect each other on different levels. Understanding and explaining player behavior from different perspectives can help us build a more comprehensive understanding.</p>

    <title>Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players: Analysis of Several Game Fails</title>
    <url>/2023/01/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20230105_28584_1061653/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230105/28584_1061653.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, <em>nijigen</em> (二次元) users have increasingly become the focus of game developers as a potential audience, and on this basis, a variety of genres and gameplay of <em>nijigen</em> games have emerged. However, not all <em>nijigen</em> games can fully meet the needs and expectations of <em>nijigen</em> players. Numerous cases of games stepping on landmines also tell development teams that, as a highly specific player group, <em>nijigen</em> players have some significant minefields in terms of game experience and evaluation. This article will start from the characteristics of <em>nijigen</em> players and analyze the potential experience minefields that <em>nijigen</em> games may encounter.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?"></a>1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?</h2><p>Before answering this question, we must first define what <em>nijigen</em> is. <em>Nijigen</em>, originally meaning “two-dimensional world”, originated in Japan and later became a specialized term in the ACGN subculture circle (including animation, comics, games, novels, etc.), mainly referring to animation, comics, and game works composed of two-dimensional images, as well as the virtual world constructed by their derivatives. In a sense, <em>nijigen</em> is used by the ACGN subculture circle as a term for a fictional world or a fantasy world. It is essentially an existence distinct from the real world (<em>sanjigen</em>, 三次元, meaning “three-dimensional”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1628b45d-7740-4139-a5e3-576f6c85fafa.png/size/"></p>
<p>Considering the broad concept of <em>nijigen</em> itself, the definition of “nijigen games” is also diverse. According to the target players, <em>nijigen</em> games can be divided into two types: “surface <em>nijigen</em>“ and “core <em>nijigen</em>“. Surface <em>nijigen</em> games refer to traditional genre games with a <em>nijigen</em> aesthetic style. The <em>nijigen</em> art style is just a way and means for the game to package traditional gameplay; while core <em>nijigen</em> games are more complex, they explore the deep-seated needs of <em>nijigen</em> culture and users. In terms of game worldview and plot construction, character design, and gameplay ideas, they more reflect the characteristics and preferences of <em>nijigen</em> users as a highly specific subculture group.</p>
<p>In order to understand the reasons why this core <em>nijigen</em> game may attract <em>nijigen</em> players, we used questionnaires and in-depth interviews for research, and summarized the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game factors</strong>, including but not limited to fun game mechanics, good-looking game character design, and attractive plots.</li>
<li><strong>Social factors</strong>, including wanting to integrate into the surrounding circle of friends, socializing with like-minded people, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>tendency of <em>nijigen</em> culture itself to be dreamy and escapist</strong>, including players’ emotional sustenance for game characters, and the game world view can help players escape from real-life pressures and problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players"><a href="#2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?"></a>2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?</h2><p>Considering the many needs of <em>nijigen</em> players for <em>nijigen</em> games, in recent years, domestic game developers have continued to make efforts and launched a variety of <em>nijigen</em> games. However, it should be noted that not every <em>nijigen</em> game is fully in line with the needs and expectations of players after its launch. What’s more, some games have stepped on landmines during the launch and continuous operation, which ultimately led to a decline in players’ in-game activity and out-of-game reputation. Why do these games touch minefields? Where are the potential minefields for <em>nijigen</em> players? By analyzing famous <em>nijigen</em> game failure cases on the market, this article draws the following conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations"><a href="#Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations"></a>Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations</h3><p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding and expectations of the cultural background, worldview, character settings, and their relationship with the characters in the game. Therefore, there may be differences in understanding between game developers and players in terms of the game worldview&#x2F;cultural background, character settings, and the relationship between players and characters, which may lead to deep-seated misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<p>For example, in September 2021, the new SSR Shikigami, <em>Hagishime</em> and <em>Shokurei</em>, announced during the fifth anniversary celebration of <em>Onmyoji</em>, caused a lot of controversy in player gathering and game exchange communities such as Weibo Super Topic and Zhihu. By analyzing the negative public opinion feedback from players, we found that the focus of the controversy was mainly on the art style of the two Shikigami. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9e14f1bd-5a3f-433b-ad1c-a835fa9b39b5.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The art style of the Shikigami is very inconsistent with the game’s art style. Hagishime looks like a traditional Japanese-style Chinese girl, wearing a tight-fitting small cheongsam, which makes me feel sick.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Chinese style elements of the new Shikigami are not well reflected. They are purely Japanese-style Shikigami, but they are mixed with Chinese style elements, which is very abrupt when they stand with other Shikigami. Onmyoji doesn’t look like Onmyoji anymore.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It’s very uncomfortable. The concept is already a Japanese-style game, but now it packages Chinese culture as Japanese characters, speaks Japanese, and can also blow sugar figures, our intangible cultural heritage. It’s hard not to make people think too much.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that the main trigger of this public opinion incident was that the design of the new Shikigami was mixed with Chinese style elements, which was relatively abrupt compared to the original Japanese style of <em>Onmyoji</em>. We know that <em>nijigen</em> culture originated in Japan. Although it has a significant influence in East Asia and even the world, the Japanese-style imprint of <em>nijigen</em> itself is still very distinct. Based on this, <em>nijigen</em> users are very sensitive to the possible Japanese&#x2F;Chinese style mixing in <em>nijigen</em> works, and feel that it is a challenge to the “purity” of the cultural background of the work.</p>
<p>In addition, domestic <em>nijigen</em> players are very sensitive to possible historical hints related to Japan and China in the game. When designing the worldview and characters, it is also necessary to try to avoid domestic players’ negative historical imaginations, including but not limited to wars of aggression, colonial history, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the game’s worldview and cultural background, <em>nijigen</em> players also have a unique understanding of the character design, art style, and their relationship with the characters in the game, which also requires developers to continue to pay attention during the game development and continuous operation. We still take <em>Onmyoji</em> as an example. In 2019, the official designed a new skin for the Shikigami <em>Onikiri</em>, as shown below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F276b255c-26d6-40db-a615-a32a174fc321.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>As soon as the new skin was launched, it was questioned by many players. Players believed that the bangs, the sharp blade designed in the style of a kitchen knife, and the <em>kariginu</em> (狩衣) that resembled an apron made <em>Onikiri</em>, known as the “most powerful demon-slaying weapon of the Minamoto family”, appear “maid-like”, which was very different from its long-standing image of a “sharp blade” in the hearts of players. This case also tells us that in terms of character portraits and skin design, <em>nijigen</em> games should be in line with <em>nijigen</em> players’ imagination of character rarity, personality, and combat strength. Even when setting the skin and skill strength of popular characters, it is necessary to carefully consider player expectations.</p>
<p>The characters and settings in <em>nijigen</em> games are not completely independent of the players’ imagination. On the contrary, <em>nijigen</em> players are considered to be consumers with the characteristics of productive consumers (prosumers). They are often not limited to unilaterally consuming the acquired <em>nijigen</em> content, but also provide new content possibilities through their own understanding and reprocessing. This also requires <em>nijigen</em> games to provide interfaces for players’ active deconstruction and reshaping in terms of worldview, character, and plot design. Generally speaking, this interface is through the direct relationship between the player and the <em>nijigen</em> character, which is generally divided into four relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyber Lover Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with romantic elements. Players believe that they have an ambiguous relationship with the characters. “Playing the game is like falling in love with a paper person”.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivation Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with strong cultivation elements. Players believe that they are raising the characters, and the characters are their own “children”.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive Relationship:</strong> Players believe that they can immerse themselves in the characters and integrate into the game world through the observation and behavior of the characters.</li>
<li><strong>Spectator Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games where the characters have their own storylines. Players are more of spectators and plot promoters, watching the love and hate between the characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding of their relationship with the characters in the game. The same character in the same game can even have completely different plot and character network development when interpreted by different players. At this time, <em>nijigen</em> games need to try to avoid large errors between their own design of the plot and character relationships and the players’ own imagination. For example, if a player regards a character in the game as a “waifu”, but a real official NPC partner appears in the process of advancing the plot, this will cause discomfort to the player’s experience.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen"><a href="#Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen"></a>Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen</h3><p>The previous minefields are limited to <em>nijigen</em> games and users themselves, but under this minefield, <em>nijigen</em> games need to face the broader impact of <em>sanjigen</em> reality. In the eyes of <em>nijigen</em> players, one of the important demands of experiencing <em>nijigen</em> games is to escape reality. Although <em>nijigen</em> and <em>sanjigen</em> have mutual influence, it is necessary to make a clear distinction when necessary. For example, players are very taboo about <em>nijigen</em> characters having significant <em>sanjigen</em> prototypes or private settings, which they believe affect their own immersion and imagination. In addition, in the selection of spokespersons for <em>nijigen</em> games, <em>nijigen</em> players have their own screening strategies: in addition to being in line with the character settings, they will also consider a certain ranking of spokespersons. Celebrities and idols from <em>sanjigen</em> may even be criticized by <em>nijigen</em> players for their traffic and influence.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that <em>nijigen</em> games and <em>sanjigen</em> are completely unrelated. If there is a problem with the behind-the-scenes staff of <em>sanjigen</em> (including but not limited to legal, political, and moral issues), which affects the player’s experience of <em>nijigen</em> characters, most <em>nijigen</em> players cannot tolerate it, and the official needs to respond quickly.</p>

Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?"></a>3. Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?</h2><p>The analysis of the possible experience minefields of <em>nijigen</em> players in <em>nijigen</em> games shows the importance of analyzing the characteristics, preferences, and minefields of specific player groups for the successful development and continuous operation of games. What kind of ideas and methods can be summarized from this?</p>
<p>In terms of research ideas, it is first necessary to analyze the portrait and needs of specific player groups. The development team needs to understand the characteristics of the player group and analyze the possible needs of players for the game from the characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, questionnaires can cover a larger group of players in a short period of time, which can help the development team to draw relatively “universal” group characteristics. However, if you encounter situations where you need to dig deeper into details, you can use more qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups for research.</p>

    <title>How to Interpret the Emotions of Players from European and American Communities Through Their Online Chats</title>
    <url>/2022/12/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20230105_28584_1061655/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230105/28584_1061655.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Player interactions within the game community are an important channel for us to collect player feedback. Unlike face-to-face communication, when we look at the chat content in the community, we lack information beyond language, such as eyes, gestures, and tone of voice, to help us grasp the player’s emotional tendency. If we only focus on the literal meaning of the chat, we might take the player’s sarcasm seriously.</p>
<p>Take the following messages as examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br><em>Game just entirely froze right as the last team came into view. In a gold 1 rated ranked match….nice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br><em>New patch for bots is lovely there absolutely a joke now thanks naraka</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br><em>Player 1: whens gta6 coming out<br>Player 2: 2045<br>Player 1: damn that early?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nice”, “lovely”, “thanks”, “early” seem to reflect the player’s positive emotions, but if you look closely, you can find something wrong: How can it be a good thing to have a problem (froze) in a gold 1 ranked match? If the bots after the new patch are really lovely, how can they be a joke? Is it really early for <em>GTA6</em> to come out in 2045? It seems that no matter what language the players use, they like to use sarcasm.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to correctly interpret players’ emotions from their expressions, in addition to mastering the language used by players, we also need to understand some of their emotional language expression habits.</p>
<h2 id="1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations"></a>1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations</h2><p>Words are composed of letters, so players will manipulate the letters to transform the words. Common methods include using uppercase letters, repeating letters, and replacing words with letters or numbers that sound similar.</p>
<p>Capital letters are generally used at the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, etc., so capital letters are more powerful than lowercase letters, which are usually used. Players will use capital letters to spell words or sentences to express emphasis and strong feelings. For example, we once saw a comment like this: “WHY IS THERE NO SHOWDOWN FOR HALLOWEEN?!?!?”. The player likes Showdown and really hopes to be able to play this mode during Halloween, so the whole message uses capital letters, and the formal deformation is very eye-catching, so as to express their strong desire to play the Showdown mode.</p>
<p>Repeating letters is related to lengthening the pronunciation. For example, one “i” in “ship” is a short vowel, while “ee” in “sheep” is a long vowel. Players can lengthen the word and pronunciation by using repeated letters in the word, such as Morrnnninnggggg (morning), Leeeeeeeeaaaavvvveee (leave), Chilllllll (chill); it can also be used to emphasize the loudness of the sound. SHEEEEESH in the rooster meme below is an example of this usage. Both the image and the text of the rooster meme indicate the loudness of the sound. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F211974b2-df0f-4dd9-800b-6b4b2e45d248.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Meme containing repeated letters</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Repeated letters can also be used to express emphasis, “I have 2 buckets candieeees”. This is a player participating in the in-game Halloween event, where players can get event items by giving candy bags to other players, but this player has two candy bags that cannot be given away, and naturally, they cannot get event items. Players sometimes encounter fellow singers in chat and suddenly start a lyric chain, you say “PROVOKINNNNNGGGGGG”, and I say “BURY THE LIGHT DEEP WITHINNNNN”, using both capitalization and repetition, making people feel the loudness and energy of the song just by looking at the message. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F2287a125-8ef7-4fe8-b98a-616b26366b29.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players engaged in a lyric chain</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players will also use letters and numbers to replace words or parts of words that have the same pronunciation, such as “b4” for “before” and “U” for “you”; sometimes they will also use the pattern of an item with the same pronunciation to represent a word, such as: “U owe me a skin no [image of a hat]”, the hat pattern at the end of the sentence refers to the word “cap”, and “cap” here means “lie”. This sentence means “you owe me a skin, don’t lie”.</p>
<p>Players bet with skins in the game, and the loser has to give the winner a skin. Since “lie” has a slightly serious accusatory meaning, the player uses “cap” instead of “lie” to make the conversation more relaxed and lively. Using the hat pattern instead of directly typing the word further weakens the negative color of “lie”, making the sentence more euphemistic, like a friend reminding jokingly, “Hey, you owe me a skin, don’t lie”. Players also use spaces and line breaks to change the presentation of words and sentences. For example, adding spaces between each letter of a word, L i e s, gives the feeling of spelling out each letter, highlighting the player’s serious attitude and emphasis; another example is using line breaks to split a sentence into paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p><em>One</em></p>
<p><em>Is</em></p>
<p><em>Gonna</em></p>
<p><em>Grab</em></p>
<p><em>Me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each line break is a pause. This form emphasizes the content of each line, which better reflects the player’s pride and confidence in their gaming skills.</p>
<h2 id="2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere"><a href="#2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere"></a>2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere</h2><p>In addition to using memes, European and American players also like to be lazy, using many abbreviations, omissions, or slang in community chats. These methods can not only save typing time and improve chat efficiency, but also help create a relaxed and interesting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a great way to be lazy. We have also encountered abbreviations before, such as ASAP for “as soon as possible”; players will also use the first letter of each word to represent commonly used phrases or sentences, such as “rn” for “right now”, “goat” for “greatest of all time”, “ngl” for “not gonna lie”, “wdym” for “what do you mean”. When we encounter similar abbreviations, we can google the original phrase and accumulate them and create a “player’s common slang library” for future public opinion work.</p>
<p>Omission is also used skillfully by players. Players will omit vowels or consonants in word spelling, and omit punctuation in sentence spelling. In word spelling, vowel letters are omitted, leaving only consonant letters to provide clues to the pronunciation of the word, such as “abt” for “about”, “smh” for “somehow”, “tlk” for “talk”, “nvm” for “never mind”. Although the words are not spelled completely, players who are familiar with this method can restore the complete words through consonant letters.</p>
<p>In addition, players sometimes omit consonant letters, such as “em” for “them”. In order to avoid sensitive words, players will also omit consonant letters, “shi” (omitting the final t). In addition, they will also use symbols with similar shapes to replace letters ($ for S) or use spaces to break up words. As for the omission of punctuation, the first to bear the brunt is ‘, so can’t becomes cant, and I’ll becomes ill.</p>
<p>There is also some slang among players, such as “cap” for “liar”, “simp” for “a person who is overly attentive to someone they like”, “beef” for “brag, show off”. If you can use abbreviations, omissions, and slang skillfully, you must be an active member of community communication and have made great contributions to creating a relaxed and interesting community atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id="3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills"><a href="#3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills"></a>3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills</h2><p>Players will also mix other foreign languages besides English when communicating in the community. The use of foreign languages is either to find partners who use the same language, or to enhance feelings in the process of discussing foreign language learning. Mastering multiple languages is also a manifestation of ability. For example, players will also mix in a few sentences of Spanish or French when chatting, with the purpose of finding friends who speak the same language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: Como vas amigo (How are you, friend)<br>Player 2: Bien. Y tu? (I’m fine, and you)<br>Player 1: Esperando encontrar una partida (I want to find a partner to play games)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the vast sea of English, the sudden appearance of a few sentences in Spanish is like an indicator light, guiding two players who use the same language to get to know each other and become good friends who play games together. But not all friend requests sent in foreign languages will be responded to, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 3: alguien habla español ¿? (Does anyone speak Spanish?)<br>mi nick es “ ……” (My game nickname is…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This player sent a friend request in Spanish and attached his game nickname, but failed to meet a partner who also speaks Spanish in the channel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F912e6a5c-260a-4c5f-ad0d-011e9deb36b8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Player looking for a Spanish-speaking partner</em></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F3798b3c7-d56d-4d94-bb60-024690802652.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Failed to find a Spanish-speaking partner</em></p>
<hr>
<p>European and American players also have foreign language courses in school, the most common being Spanish and French. Occasionally, players will ask other players for help with foreign languages in the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: First language is Spanish but have been learning English since 4th grade<br>Player 2: Teach me espanol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that mastering multiple foreign languages is also a manifestation of ability. Players’ community IDs will also use other languages. Some are Korean players such as “서융”, and some are influenced by Chinese games and use Chinese IDs like “卧虎藏龙” (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Fcb335308-e94a-43d4-9285-d3d08e3cbe37.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players Using Korean and Chinese IDs.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of using Chinese IDs, players have repeatedly mentioned the Chinese game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in game-related discussions, and have the impression that Chinese players are good at <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> because of low latency. Therefore, some players inevitably complain that they are afraid of seeing Chinese names, and that a large number of Chinese players use smurf accounts to play on their servers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: chinese named players strike fear into my soul i stopped playing for a while to see if the player based would become more diverse and now i hear xbox has naraka<br>Player 2: Spoiler alert<br>Half of those CN names<br>Are NA players<br>Like me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But another player told him that half of the players with Chinese names in the game are not Chinese players, like he uses a Chinese name. Later, some players explained that using Chinese names is to scare enemies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9f2e099a-51bb-4469-a01e-f4e5d807dabb.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>North American Players Using Chinese IDs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to Chinese nicknames, a phrase called “raw dragon” frequently appears in player chats. At first glance, it seems inexplicable because it has nothing to do with the context. But if you translate these two words into Chinese separately, “raw” &#x3D; “生”, “dragon” &#x3D; “龙”, and the combination is “生龙”, doesn’t this pronunciation sound familiar? Isn’t this the “升龙” (“Shoryuken”, “Rising Dragon”) in the game? These foreign players really understand the word. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Ff0bed8dd-552a-4f16-841f-fff477f6b632.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World"><a href="#4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World" class="headerlink" title="4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World"></a>4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World</h2><p>Some say that music transcends culture and language, and so do emojis. Emojis use pictures to express emotions, and the meaning of most emojis can be inferred and felt from the picture, without being affected by language.</p>
<p>European and American players like to use emojis in chat. In Discord, emojis are roughly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>● One is Discord’s own basic emojis, which are free for players to use;</p>
<p>● The second is the emojis provided by each server in Discord to players, which can only be used within that server (unless you subscribe to Discord Nitro). The official <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> server provides a set of emojis for players, including emojis based on in-game heroes and emojis newly created based on popular emoji elements (Pepe the Frog, etc.);</p>
<p>● The third is GIFs. Players can search for popular GIFs or save the GIFs they encounter in chats for their own use.</p>
<p>European and American players use these three types of emojis when chatting in the community. Discord’s own emojis and the emojis provided by the current server are the most frequently used by players and are most likely to generate emoji chains, because everyone can use these two types of emojis freely, which is a common language among emojis. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp"><a href="#nbsp" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F32055299-f4d6-423b-a7e4-93b34f6a239e.png/size/"></h2><p><em>Various Emoji usage on Discord.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players use different emojis according to the chat content, and sometimes use emojis to express simple meanings. The meaning of basic emojis (similar to the emojis that come with Apple products) is not affected by language, such as [heart] to express “love”, [eyes emoji] to express “watching”, “secretly observing”.</p>
<p>Complex emojis can express richer meanings, so players need to observe the pictures and feel their emotions. For example: this emoji is slightly different from the usual dog head, and the meaning is also more friendly, with the meaning of “leisure”, which can be used to watch other players chat, and is also easy to cause emoji chains. However, the most frequently used emoji is Rua. This flustered kitten will not go wrong in any occasion. It has mixed meanings of “surprise”, “excitement”, and “greeting”. It is simply a versatile emoji that is not easy to go wrong in any occasion. But if you delve into the meaning of Rua, the answer can only be “Rua is Rua!”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1cb4bb7f-1f3b-46f2-902a-f1774aaec16e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Common Emojis.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Emojis can also be used for dialogue. Taking server emojis as an example, players will take out server-limited emojis that previous players have not posted, which is a tacit understanding of the same server; the same situation applies to personally collected GIFs. If a player who prefers <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs encounters another player who also has a large inventory of <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs, the two will communicate with each other using emojis, while other players who lack this type of emoji may not be able to join the conversation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F5138c3d3-df6c-4a49-977f-52169769243e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Emoji Usage in Discord Servers</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the emojis in Discord, players will also use emoji characters, which are slightly different from the common emoticons we see. The emoji characters used by European and American players are relatively traditional, basically vertical, and need to be rotated ninety degrees to be understood, :), :(, B(, :&lt;, :C, D:, D;, xD, :D, and some emoji characters can be repeated in the mouth part, deriving emoji characters such as :)), B(((, xDD. By repeating a certain part of the emoji character, players can express stronger emotions. Players also use horizontal characters, such as -.-, T_T, o.O, but rarely use more vivid emoticons or patterns built with characters.</p>
<p>The GIFs collected by players may be very different, but the emojis provided by Discord and the server are shared resources of players on the same server. When players use these shared emojis, it is easier to get corresponding emoji feedback. In addition, when using classic emojis (such as Pepe the Frog) in personal collections, it is also easier to elicit responses from other players.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>When understanding European and American players’ feedback and needs for games through player communities, in addition to language skills, we also need to understand the language expression habits of European and American players in order to accurately grasp the player’s emotional tendencies and understand the player’s real needs. The set of online communication methods in the player community described in this article, such as emojis, abbreviations, omissions, and unusual word and sentence presentation forms in chat, are like eyes, gestures, and tones of voice in face-to-face communication, which can provide us with a basis for grasping player emotions and try to avoid falling into the trap of players’ sarcasm.</p>

    <title>Thousands of Troops in Battle, Who Will Lead Them - A Preliminary Exploration of Battlefield Information Interaction in SLG Games</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230202/28584_1071367.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China"></a>1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China</h2><p>Sid Meier, the father of the <em>Civilization</em> series, once expressed his understanding of games with this sentence: “A game is a series of interesting choices.”</p>
<p>Game developers choose and design game mechanics, while players experience choices within the game mechanics, and ultimately, players choose the game. The broad concept of SLG games can be traced back to <em>Civilization</em> in the 1990s. With the development of the Internet era, players gradually began to desire social elements on the basis of single-player gameplay, and SLG mobile games emerged. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F075804e9-2a84-4efc-8575-6c80364b879e.png/size/"></p>
<p>In 2015, with the huge success of <em>Clash of Kings</em> (COK) in the Chinese mobile game market and worldwide, the relatively niche sub-genre of SLG mobile games entered the vision of the general public and game manufacturers. In the same year, just as large and small game manufacturers in China were preparing their own COK-like mobile games, NetEase released a sandbox strategy mobile game called <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> (<em>率土之滨</em>). This mobile game, based on the historical background of the warlord separatism in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, did not become a follower of COK. Instead, it created a unique gameplay mechanism in the SLG category and developed into the pioneering work of the “Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like” category of games that would contend with COK-like games in the future of domestic SLG mobile games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F95ec6618-7a2e-4394-a29f-7878d2d1f135.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the development and iteration of SLG games in recent years, various COK-like and Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like mobile games have sprung up. The limitation of these games is that they only made micro-innovations in the worldview and some mechanisms, but essentially did not deviate from the underlying framework of COK or Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Currently, most mainstream domestic SLGs are simulation strategy war games, whose main feature is a sandbox map as the core activity space, with high social strategy. Unlike SLG series such as <em>Civilization</em> and <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, the core experience and fun of current SLG mobile games have gradually shifted from the content provided by the game itself, that is, the interaction between players and the game, to the behavior and interaction between players.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the main body of player-game interaction and the carrier of interaction between players, the importance of information interaction on the sandbox map of SLG mobile games is self-evident. This article will conduct a preliminary exploration and analysis of battlefield information interaction in SLG games.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Underlying-Logic-of-Sand-Table-Types"><a href="#2-The-Underlying-Logic-of-Sand-Table-Types" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underlying Logic of Sand Table Types"></a>2. The Underlying Logic of Sand Table Types</h2><p>According to the interaction logic of the sand table, the sand tables of SLG mobile games can be divided into two types: coordinate type and path type. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F09dad672-b988-4117-8138-a1350f0b8b26.png/size/"></p>
<p>The coordinate-type sand table is based on a two-dimensional coordinate system. The map elements on the coordinate-type sand table map are all independent “points”. You only need to input coordinate instructions to go to the target position. The sand table maps of <em>Clash of Kings</em> and <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> belong to the coordinate type. The path-type sand table is similar to a network topology. It adds path requirements on the basis of the coordinate-type sand table. Players need to have “connecting land” to reach the target location. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F54619b7b-8a65-4959-af56-963116ac556c.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Different sand table types bring vastly different depths of gameplay strategy and division of labor. For example, the unique mechanisms of “road paving” and “battle-free period” in Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games come from this. Although the path-type sand table type can provide deeper and broader playability, it also increases the game burden on players to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Although some Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games have introduced functions such as AI automatic road paving or scheduled occupation, overly intelligent proxy operations also compress the player’s operating space, resulting in a decline in the game’s DAU. The future trend of SLG mobile games may be to achieve a balance between auxiliary tools and game experience, so that players with different levels of dedication can “get what they want” and maximize the game experience in their respective positions.</p>
<h2 id="3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements"><a href="#3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Interaction Design of Map Elements"></a>3. Interaction Design of Map Elements</h2><p>Thanks to the real historical background and reliable element architecture, in the grand sand table map of over 2.25 million tiles, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only has historical cities of the late Eastern Han Dynasty, famous historical sites admired by the world, and natural terrain processed for balance based on strict adherence to real mountains and rivers, and resource lands for player development, but also includes building elements with military or development functions. These rich map elements jointly participate in the construction of the game mechanism of this work, giving it a strong historical atmosphere and a strong sense of immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F26f226c8-9386-4698-aa5d-84a99bd14aaa.png/size/"></p>
<p>In order to enable players to efficiently and stably obtain the information meaning of many map elements and minimize the occurrence of misoperations, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> mainly designs from the following two levels:</p>
<p>In terms of visual interaction, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> designs visual elements consistent with its semantics for each map element, which greatly reduces the cognitive burden of players. For resource lands with two to nine levels, it first uses four typical characteristic elements of mountains, forests, iron smelting, and rice to distinguish them, and then differentiates them according to the number of elements (two to four levels) and buildings (five to nine levels). In addition, in order to meet the visual preferences of different players as much as possible, the game also provides 2D&#x2F;3D visual schemes for players to freely switch.</p>
<p>In terms of map interaction, when the player clicks on any land unit on the map, the detailed information of the unit and corresponding operation prompts will be displayed. For operations that cannot be performed, grayscale images are displayed instead of being directly hidden. Moreover, when the player clicks on the interaction option, the reason why the operation cannot be performed will be informed in text, so that the player can understand. Through detailed interaction feedback, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only greatly reduces the learning threshold and cognitive burden of new players, but also effectively avoids many misoperation events caused by inadequate information interaction, which greatly improves the player’s interaction experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F14e64f92-2868-4a94-a2f6-098b55687f38.png/size/"></p>
<p>Similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>, the resource lands of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> also use characteristic elements and buildings to graphically distinguish resource lands, and further directly and clearly mark the level of resource lands in the form of text. This visual interaction design achieves a win-win situation in terms of experience and efficiency. However, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> is limited by the overall map style and is not suitable for direct map marking, so it can only be supplemented by interaction feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, the map resource search control of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> can quickly locate the target type and level of resource land, freeing players from the tedious map information retrieval, which greatly improves the player’s interaction efficiency and game experience. </p>

<h2 id="4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers"><a href="#4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers" class="headerlink" title="4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers"></a>4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers</h2><p>“Marching” in <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> refers to the command operation of sending a team from a certain starting point to a certain end point. When the player issues this operation, a marking line composed of directional arrows will be formed between the starting point grid and the end point grid, so that the player can obtain marching information. At the same time, there will be an army element walking along the marching marker line. This element consists of a marching icon, a marching countdown, and the troop composition: the enemy and friend can be identified by the icon and the color of the marching marker (blue for allies, red for others), the marching countdown shows the time remaining until the end of the march; the troop composition represents the arms that make up this troop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F37ad7f0f-7a00-4c6d-9ceb-da9777c80fdd.png/size/"></p>
<p>In actual combat, the information value provided by marching markers is far more than what is shown on the surface: by identifying enemies and friends, you can judge the approximate scale of the enemy and our forces invested in the current land&#x2F;war zone; by analyzing the troop composition of the army element, you can analyze the arms attributes and characteristics of the three generals that make up this troop, and guess the configuration of the incoming troop based on the mainstream troops of the version; according to the marching countdown and the preview of the marching time, you can grasp the timing of the troop’s attack. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F114839bf-f81f-4482-be77-e4500f516ff2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The marching marker elements of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> are similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players on the same sandbox map can obtain information such as enemy and friend information, marching countdown, and troop composition through marching markers. But unlike traditional SLG mobile games, the RTS control mode of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> adds more possibilities to marching. Although RTS has higher requirements for the player’s online time, and micro-operations are difficult to truly realize on the mobile game platform, this flexible mode with a stronger operating experience has attracted a large number of players and received good market feedback.</p>
<h2 id="5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map"><a href="#5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map" class="headerlink" title="5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map"></a>5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map</h2><p>As the core element of the SLG mobile game mechanism, the alliance (nation) mechanism is not only a centralized social window in the game, but also the main platform for players to obtain settlement rewards in the season process. The confrontation between players takes the form of wars between alliances. In the vast sandbox map, it is crucial to distinguish enemy and friend information intuitively and efficiently. <em>Clash of Kings</em> uses different land grid colors to distinguish the ownership of different alliances, while <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> has innovated the land ownership information in multiple dimensions: the player’s own land units are marked in green, alliance units are marked in blue, non-alliance units are marked in red, hostile alliance units are marked in dark red, and friendly alliance units are marked with a blue border… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F30605791-57b5-4dfd-96eb-9e3dfed99faf.png/size/"></p>
<p>“Six Secret Teachings” says: “Ascend to high places and look down to observe the changes of the enemy.” If you can see the overall situation, you can plan to defeat the enemy; if you are blinded by a leaf, you will inevitably be trapped. On the battlefield, if you can quickly grasp the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, you can make more accurate strategic judgments. The core of the SLG requirement path is a strategic model based on multi-person participation in phased requirements (exploration, expansion, development, elimination, etc.). With the continuous development and improvement of the SLG mobile game alliance mechanism, and the refinement of the division of labor of players’ roles and positions in the alliance, the early lower-level map information mode based on land unit information can no longer meet the information needs of local tactical strategies and even global strategic posture formulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fa511d00f-8ab0-46ef-8866-1efc8af9a4c4.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Limited by the screen size of mobile games, players can often only obtain more information by constantly sliding the screen. This method is not only inefficient but also easily confuses information, which seriously affects the game experience of some users. Although the “larger field of view” configuration option provided by early developers in the game settings already has the prototype and awareness of a strategic map, this does not fundamentally solve the problem. In the strategic map level, most of the map elements have become generalized summary information. At this time, land unit information is no longer important. These information unrelated to decision-making will be filtered out, leaving more global map information for decision-makers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4fc1e88d-75df-410d-8977-694eaa3fb3c5.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the August 2022 update, the strategic map function was officially launched in all season servers of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players can enter the strategic mode by zooming out the screen view. In the strategic mode, the visual range is 20 times that of the normal view, providing players with a more macroscopic observation perspective, so as to easily grasp the overall situation and provide strong support for the strategic decision-making of alliance commanders.</p>
<p>Different from the detailed land information in the normal view, the strategic view abstracts and simplifies various information elements, focusing on key strategic information such as land ownership, marching routes, garrison status in war zones, native cities and facilities, and extreme weather effects. Although the strategic map of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> was launched later than similar competitive products, this strategic map that deeply fits the gameplay of Romance of the Three Kingdoms effectively reduces the burden of information recognition for players, highlights the important information that players really need in strategic analysis, and greatly optimizes the map information interaction experience while improving interaction efficiency. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F65dbbf3e-b96f-480b-921a-e3b27c5a6152.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>As the main body of player-game interaction and the key carrier of interaction between players, the SLG game sand table battlefield not only carries the logical framework of the entire game, ensures the harmony and unity of the screen style and theme setting, but also takes into account the player’s interaction experience and provides corresponding support controls. It can be said to be the most basic and most worthy of repeated consideration in SLG games.</p>
<p>This article mainly focuses on the information interaction of the sand table battlefield, and briefly discusses the underlying logic of its sand table type, the interaction design of map elements, the connotation mining of marching markers, and the design iteration of the strategic map from the perspective of user experience. So far, the problems to be solved and the contradictions to be coordinated in the SLG sand table map still exist. It is believed that with the development and progress of the industry, better competing products or updates will bring a better game experience to players.</p>

    <title>Breaking the Fourth Wall - Meta Elements in Narrative-Driven Games</title>
    <url>/2023/01/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20230202_28584_1071368/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230202/28584_1071368.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The fourth wall is a virtual wall facing the audience in a traditional proscenium stage with three sides, symbolizing the boundary between the audience and the actors, reality and virtuality.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional stages such as movies and dramas, narrative-driven games are stages with more interaction; when the boundary between the game and reality becomes blurred, the player’s cognition of the game will be challenged. Imagine that you are controlling the protagonist to do “silly things” in the map for fun, but he suddenly turns his head and stares at you, and asks you to stop… This kind of design that breaks the fourth wall belongs to meta.</p>
<p>Meta-games, also translated as “metagames” or “hypergames,” and out-of-game elements beyond the gameplay itself can be called meta elements. Narrowly speaking, a meta-game refers to a full-process game that takes breaking the fourth wall as its core gameplay; in general narrative-driven games, meta elements of different depths can also be added to produce a momentary stunning effect.</p>
<p>In traditional game design theory, emphasis is placed on creating a virtual world isolated from real life as much as possible through various rules and restrictions, as well as graphics, music, dialogue, etc., to maintain the player’s immersion. Game design based on meta elements does the opposite, blurring the boundaries between games and real life by breaking the illusion of the game, thus bringing strong emotional experiences to players: ordinary games pull you into the screen, while meta-games always try to crawl out of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements"></a>1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements</h2><p>Meta means breaking the concept of traditional games at some level, such as the player being the only conscious operator in the game, the game content and out-of-game computer operations not interfering with each other, the virtual world of the game not containing concepts such as players, artists, and developers. Meta elements can generally be divided into language, trick, and interactive experience; the shallower depth can only be used as a decoration to adjust the atmosphere, and the deeper excavation can become the core of the game’s plot or even the core of gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature"><a href="#Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature"></a>Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature</h3><p>As embellishments, meta elements often appear in the form of surprises or easter eggs, and do not have a strong challenge to the player’s cognition. In fact, the appearance of game producers who were originally hidden behind the scenes in the game and interacting with players is a very common meta design; they often make statements that are extremely inconsistent with the style of the game or give special items, allowing players to temporarily break away from the serious game plot and take a breather; some more detailed meta designs can also surprise players, such as waiting for a period of time on the start interface, and the small animal facing away from the screen suddenly turns to look at the outside of the screen, etc. </p>

<h3 id="Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot"><a href="#Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design About Character Plot"></a>Meta Design About Character Plot</h3><p>One type of meta that explores deeper and is widely used is to imply or explicitly state that the characters in the game have self-awareness that is not controlled by the player; the characters know that they are game characters, and can understand the existence of the player, and even read the player’s user folder name to address the player.</p>
<p>The experience of being recognized is a double-edged sword. When the character’s attitude towards recognizing the player is peaceful and friendly, and there is no very intense interaction, the player will feel that this is a novel and interesting experience, such as Anna in <em>VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em> who knows that she is in a game and tries to escape. However, when the game character shows criticism, sarcasm, or hurt towards the player, this experience of being watched will bring a great psychological gap to the player and re-examine their game behavior. </p>

One type of meta element breaks through this common sense of the game and replaces it with the common sense of the real world.</p>
<p>In the RPG horror puzzle game <em>The Witch’s House</em>, the player can enter a hidden ending where the character in the castle dies on their own due to being left unattended for a long time by waiting at the birth point for an hour without entering the castle; in the game <em>Needy Streamer Overload</em>, to achieve the hidden ending where the heroine quits the internet, the player needs to play the game offline. </p>

<h3 id="Atypical-Meta-Design"><a href="#Atypical-Meta-Design" class="headerlink" title="Atypical Meta Design"></a>Atypical Meta Design</h3><p>There is also a type of meta that is not meta in the usual sense, which creates a better sense of immersion by breaking the boundary that one thought oneself was in a single-player game. For example, in the boss battle of a certain ending of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, players can get assistance from other players who have cleared the game; after winning the battle, players can choose to sacrifice their entire game save in exchange for help for subsequent players, just like previous players. </p>

Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?"></a>2. Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?</h2><p>In traditional narrative-driven games, when players control the characters on the screen, they identify themselves with the identity of the protagonist on the screen on the one hand, and clearly know their identity as players on the other hand. Being a player means that one is the only conscious character in the game, and the behavior in the game will not affect real life, and there is no need to bear any responsibility and material loss for the behavior - these unspoken common principles in the game ensure that players can safely immerse themselves in the game experience.</p>
<p>The excellent meta with greater depth can bring players unexpected, surprising, fearful, fooled, and even ashamed emotional experiences, often stemming from its challenge to the traditional relationship of “real-world player - virtual-world game”.</p>
<h3 id="Becoming-the-Watched-God"><a href="#Becoming-the-Watched-God" class="headerlink" title="Becoming the Watched God"></a>Becoming the Watched God</h3><p>Meta-games often challenge this common sense: the content and characters in the game are the objects of the player’s cognition, and will not in turn recognize the player. In traditional narrative-driven games, players are often the only conscious operators in the game, and interacting with the game is essentially a kind of self-entertainment.</p>
<p>However, when the object in the game behaves like an independent conscious individual and can recognize the player, the player will enter a social situation from a state of solitude, falling from an omnipotent god to a height where he needs to make eye contact with the character; his behavior suddenly has an audience watching, becoming an experience of being caught off guard.</p>
<p>Being watched means being exposed. When people don’t want to expose themselves and feel that they are about to be exposed, they are prone to fear and anxiety. This is also why meta elements most often appear in games containing psychological horror elements. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Ff708c528-80f3-4809-9932-92b3038f0e80.jpg/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Loss-of-the-Mask"><a href="#Loss-of-the-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Loss of the Mask"></a>Loss of the Mask</h3><p>The fact that the player is not recognized means that his identity in the game is actually indistinguishable from other players, that is, he has anonymity. In a completely anonymous psychological state, the psychological pressure on individuals from group norms or the influence of others will be reduced, which has the effect of relaxing the mood and reducing stress, but it is also accompanied by the loss of social responsibility and the danger of inducing various horrors and venting behaviors.</p>
<p>The game provides players with a sense of anonymity, that is, it provides players with the opportunity to play comfortably and freely in the virtual world, and even try various behaviors that cannot be tried in the social environment without regard to the consequences.</p>
<p>But when the character or the game itself is linked to the player’s real life in some way and monitors the player’s actions, arousing the player’s self-awareness, the player’s anonymity is suddenly violated, and he becomes an active participant in the plot from a casual player who does not need to be responsible, and needs to be responsible for everything that happens to the character. </p>

<h3 id="Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone"><a href="#Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone" class="headerlink" title="Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone"></a>Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone</h3><p>A sense of control refers to a psychological state in which the direction of things is under one’s control; it can enhance an individual’s positive emotional experience such as optimism and self-confidence, and weaken negative emotional experiences such as depression and helplessness. In real life, people have to face all kinds of loss of control caused by force majeure; therefore, the important charm of traditional narrative-driven games is to try to interact with the corresponding worldview system, and the player’s power to decide the fate of virtual characters.</p>
<p>Meta elements do the opposite, subtly depriving players of their sense of control in the virtual world. When players unexpectedly find that they cannot fully control their choices, cannot anticipate the relationship between their behavior and reactions, or the reactions caused are completely beyond expectations, a sense of loss of control arises. Just like a roller coaster, the temporary eruption of negative emotions is also a benign stimulus under the condition of no real danger; the anxiety caused by loss of control on the one hand pulls the player back to reality to think, and on the other hand can become an excitement point for some players. </p>

<h2 id="3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements"></a>3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements</h2><p>The most mainstream meta design forms in current narrative-driven games include interface crashes, intervention in reality, narrator intervention, and multiple playthroughs. Interface crashes guide players to pay attention to the attributes of the game itself as software, such as the start button of <em>Pony Island</em> is designed as <code>&lt;error&gt;</code> at the beginning, and players must repair it; intervention in reality takes it a step further on the level of “the program itself has life”, such as <em>IMSCARED</em> will create a new strange folder on the player’s computer desktop and put the puzzle clues in it, and players will also operate pixel computers in the game; narrator intervention is to use an independent narrator to interfere with the player’s choices, and the domestic horizontal fighting game <em>ICEY</em> is a typical example in recent years; multiple playthroughs are widely used in many pixel RPGs and Galgames, and are often related to save-related operations. The famous meta game <em>OneShot</em> has made very clever use of this technique.&lt;&#x2F;error. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4b2fd2c8-65a8-40a9-b824-2f4a8b786255.jpg/size/" alt="有必要的时候，玩家需要删改游戏存档"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>When necessary, players need to delete and modify game saves</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In essence, many meta elements are designed for the player’s own meta-gaming behavior. The environment gives players some prior knowledge, such as when a warrior in a game environment sees a monster named Medusa for the first time, the player knows to instruct the warrior to take out a mirror to reflect the gaze. In ordinary games, players will unconsciously use many meta-gaming strategies, that is, resort to out-of-game elements in their minds to make decisions in the game, such as directly entering the password in the second playthrough of a puzzle game based on memory. Ordinary games have no feedback on this strategy, and recognizing the player’s own meta-gaming behavior and setting feedback for the behavior is a way to break the fourth wall.</p>
<p>For example, in the well-known beautiful girl (horror) game <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em>, players are often deceived by the energetic color scheme and cute character images, and substitute traditional cognitions about other games of this type in their minds: not all characters can be captured, and they may also die tragically, and game saves may disappear at any time. </p>

What Can Meta Bring Us?</h2><p>The existence of meta techniques actually expands the upper limit of the ideas that plot-driven games can express as a game medium. When the boundary between virtual and real becomes blurred, the content conveyed in the game is related to real life, and what is finally left to the player is inexplicable melancholy and subtle reflection. </p>

<p><em>In <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, players can only get a variety of endings if they refuse to always follow the narrator’s instructions.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps not all meta designs are good designs; many times, they also appear only as a pastime in the tense game process. However, the potential of meta elements to convey philosophical thoughts is also undeniable. Although serious meta blurs the boundary between virtual and real, its necessary step is to awaken players from the omniscient and omnipotent dream in the game. In this sense, breaking the fourth wall is actually not breaking the wall, but discovering this wall spiritually; in the face of a living game, we have to start examining our own game behavior, our relationship with the game, and perhaps our own lives.</p>

    <title>Mastering the World Seeing the Big Picture in Game Mini-maps</title>
    <url>/2023/01/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20230202_28584_1071374/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230202/28584_1071374.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game maps are simulations of real environments, with cognitive, simulation, loading, and transmission functions. Their design is to guide players to choose certain paths and trigger certain events in the game. The mini-map in the game displays a part of the area centered on the character, which can help players quickly identify the surrounding environment, terrain, and target information. It is often placed in the corner of the game screen and is a map form that helps players determine their position in the game world.</p>
<p>So, as a game designer, how should you make good use of this information display area to convey key information to players and present a “seeing the big picture” design effect? This article will introduce three aspects: concise and clear information expression, association with character status, and association with player needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression"><a href="#1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression" class="headerlink" title="1. Concise and Clear Information Expression"></a>1. Concise and Clear Information Expression</h2><p>The mini-map function is indispensable for some games and players, but at the same time, its existence will reduce the player’s immersion in the game and distract the player’s attention to the game screen. The simplified information expression design of the mini-map is not only to pursue higher information retrieval efficiency, but also to reduce its visual interference through design, thereby enhancing the sense of substitution for the character to explore the world.</p>
<h3 id="Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display"><a href="#Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display" class="headerlink" title="Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display"></a>Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display</h3><p>Appropriate contrast can make the foreground map elements and icon labels easier to distinguish visually from their backgrounds. Different from the simple background color in general interface design, the map uses the default base map, and the content display is more complicated, which makes the mini-map need to be more refined in the use of color. In the game mini-map design, the following points can be summarized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-saturation map base map, markers use high-saturation theme colors to be consistent with the game’s visual style</li>
<li>Clear color levels, colors of different hues should be both contrasting and coordinated</li>
<li>Effective use of the symbolism of colors (such as the warning of red and yellow.</li>
</ul>

Some games use whether there is a height difference as the state distinction. For example, in <em>Battlefield 1</em>, when the character has a height difference with the target object, the marker will change from solid to hollow, which is used to roughly estimate the enemy’s position. The z-axis representation of some games includes three states: up, down, and horizontal. Use the direction of the arrow to confirm your z-axis position. For example, in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, use small arrows next to the target to show above or below. </p>

<h3 id="Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information"><a href="#Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information" class="headerlink" title="Integrated Display with Other Information"></a>Integrated Display with Other Information</h3><p>The game’s HUD is an integrated display of a “symbol list”, which needs to summarize and link similar information to form a clearer HUD layout. As a component of the HUD that occupies a large proportion, the mini-map will attract more attention from players. Displaying some information close to the mini-map allows players to always observe other information every time they check the mini-map to confirm location information, and at the same time allows the player’s visual route to be more stable and concentrated. Common examples include system information such as weather, temperature, and time. Some games also integrate character status information such as health and energy into the mini-map, but it is also necessary to pay attention to how to display this information when the mini-map UI is closed.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, special location sensing, temperature, sound, time and weather information are displayed with the mini-map in the lower right corner of the interface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F47dcfb1d-f335-41d0-b88d-2b43cb6f6496.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, health and energy and other information are combined with the mini-map in the form of small icons, and integrated information is displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fe97d898d-2e26-4866-b0ec-0cb50be6f112.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em>, health and focus are integrated with the mini-map in the form of edge strips. Integrated information display makes the entire HUD design clearer and simpler. But if the mini-map is closed, all important indicators on the UI will disappear with it, which is a point to pay attention to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd690d1b6-2663-4556-bf4d-5f35e526b774.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Edge-Blurring-Effect"><a href="#Edge-Blurring-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Edge Blurring Effect"></a>Edge Blurring Effect</h3><p>Compared with the frame design with harder outlines, the edge blurring effect can make the mini-map better integrate with the game environment and reduce visual interference. At this time, the base map is mostly a wireframe effect after grayscale processing, and the logo object is more prominent. <em>Dying Light</em> and <em>Diablo III</em> both adopt this method. Compared with <em>Darksiders II</em> with a stroked border, the visual center of the picture is significantly different. </p>

The form of the compass will not excessively destroy the sense of immersion. Their position is usually placed in the center of the top, and the design is not too conspicuous. Although it indicates the direction of the destination, it still cannot show the exact path that the player needs to take, which requires the player to still rely on their own exploration to reach the destination. Compass-style guidance makes pathfinding a part of the game loop and retains its core function. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd423018b-0224-4369-98d9-436d12248eb9.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-Associated-with-Character-Status"><a href="#2-Associated-with-Character-Status" class="headerlink" title="2. Associated with Character Status"></a>2. Associated with Character Status</h2><p>Since the character’s status in the game is constantly changing, for example, when moving and sprinting, the player’s needs for vision will be different. When the character is attacked, the mini-map, as a HUD element, can also give feedback prompts to the player through design. Therefore, the display of the mini-map also needs to be associated with the character’s status, taking into account different usage scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting"><a href="#Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting" class="headerlink" title="Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting"></a>Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting</h3><p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, when the character is in a sprinting state, usually in the situation of looting spoils, chasing enemies, and accelerating escape, the player’s need is to obtain a farther field of view. Therefore, the mini-map in the lower left corner will shrink and present a farther range of content. When sprinting ends, the display range returns to the original normal size. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, when the character moves, the task mini-map will automatically become translucent, which is convenient for players to observe the game scene while finding their way, without excessively blocking the player’s sight. </p>

Feedback performance is usually in the form of mini-map border color and mini-map special effects. Among them, the change of border color is more obvious, and high-saturation colors are mostly used to distinguish. The mini-map special effects are mostly to simulate the real state of being attacked, such as screen failure flickering, heartbeat scaling, etc., so that the mini-map is no longer a single UI independent of the game.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the mini-map has a black border in the normal state. When a battle is about to occur or a large monster appears around, a larger black border will appear around the mini-map and keep zooming like a heart rate, simulating the effect of accelerated heartbeat; after entering the combat state, the map border turns red; if the character is hiding in the grass or wearing an invisible suit at this time, the border will turn purple to indicate that the monster has not found the character in the field of vision, but is still on alert; after leaving the battle, a thick white border appears around the mini-map and then returns to the normal state, indicating that the danger is over; when riding a monster, a large white border appears around the mini-map to show the monster’s stamina value. The lower the stamina value, the smaller the diameter of the white border, until the stamina value is exhausted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F82302794-65e6-4033-8139-d0d0ffffafe3.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Need for Speed Heat</em>, when the player has a car crash, the mini-map will shake like a data stream to simulate the situation of the dashboard failure after a car crash in real life, giving the player feedback prompts while creating a real immersive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4e218385-ad05-4a7b-8f40-3e42ab9f86d1.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Associated-with-Player-Needs"><a href="#3-Associated-with-Player-Needs" class="headerlink" title="3. Associated with Player Needs"></a>3. Associated with Player Needs</h2><p>For different types of games and players’ different growth states, even different difficult terrains, the functional requirements of the mini-map vary from person to person, from time to time, and from shape to shape. Design needs to consider the player’s needs at all times, giving the mini-map more custom options and adaptation schemes to ensure a smooth and immersive game experience for players.</p>
<h3 id="Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner"><a href="#Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner" class="headerlink" title="Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner"></a>Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner</h3><p>Due to the high information density of the mini-map and the prominent visual effects of some game mini-maps, it will cause the player’s visual center to shift and lack immersion. Many games allow players to close the mini-map UI to optimize the immersive experience. By guiding in the game scene, such as NPC pathfinding&#x2F;road signs&#x2F;scene interaction&#x2F;area prompts when changing locations + player memory and other forms to achieve the purpose of pathfinding. At the same time, for example, in scenes where fighting is the core operation, direction information becomes unnecessary information, and simplifying the UI to provide players with a more focused interface design is also particularly important.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the mini-map can be switched freely. When the mini-map is closed, pressing the D-pad will briefly display the mini-map to help players quickly identify the direction.</li>
<li>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, when the player is fighting fiercely with the boss, because the player’s core need at this time is to fight and focus on the battle, the compass-style mini-map guidance will disappear at this time, and the absence of redundant UI also increases the epic sense of the battle.</li>
<li>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, players are provided with normal mode and expert mode. The expert mode hides the mini-map, allowing players familiar with the operation to focus more on immersing themselves in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain"><a href="#Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain" class="headerlink" title="Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain"></a>Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain</h3><p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, due to the variability and complexity of the interior of the Divine Beast, at this time, players need not only the information of the xy axis, but also the information of the z axis. Therefore, after entering the Divine Beast, the mini-map will switch from a 2D俯视 (fǔ shì - top-down) view to a 3D three-dimensional view to help players obtain information for exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fce639c44-baa0-4063-81cc-1d6aa95454a5.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The increasingly rich mini-map design forms are indeed eye-catching. Creative and rich detail expression simplifies the game’s pathfinding experience and improves the efficiency of map information retrieval. However, the setting of the mini-map will make many players dependent. Compared with focusing on exploring the in-game scene, the “God’s perspective” mini-map makes information acquisition easier, which will make players lazy and mechanical in exploring the world. Therefore, the mini-map not only needs a concise and immersive UI design, situational interaction design, and multi-state mode design, but also needs to give players appropriate space to process information independently. Providing personalized guidance experience for different players and scenes may also be a good solution.</p>

    <title>How to Create and Adapt Overseas Questionnaires for Global Game Releases</title>
    <url>/2023/02/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20230215_28584_1073274/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230215/28584_1073274.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a game released globally, understanding the needs of overseas users is crucial, whether during the development or operational phase. Especially when we need to stand from a more macro perspective, understanding the target market users’ product cognition, behavioral characteristics, gaming habits, and content preferences, the traditional research method of questionnaire surveys becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Questionnaire surveys can achieve understanding of all the above information in a relatively short period of time. And launching questionnaires in the game is a very effective method in the process of game development and user research, with characteristics such as “relatively low cost, relatively short time, and relatively fast conclusions.” In this article, we will tell you how to conduct the most efficient questionnaire surveys and provide some tips to avoid pitfalls when doing player research in overseas markets.</p>
<h2 id="1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games"><a href="#1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Multi-language Classification in Games"></a>1. Multi-language Classification in Games</h2><p>Multi-language classification is always essential in globally released games. However, we face a choice: which languages should we use? Let’s first look at the number of speakers of each language in the world. Besides Chinese, English (1 billion), Spanish (570 million), Hindi (540 million), Arabic (420 million), Malay (280 million), French (270 million), Bengali (270 million), Russian (270 million), and Portuguese (250 million) are the most spoken languages. Moving to games, let’s look at two examples, the enduring <em>GTA5</em> and the recent masterpiece <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, both of which are AAA-level masterpieces from world-renowned manufacturers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F71487fa7-4701-495d-86e4-d254fec9b182.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2Fa7bc2442-2b27-4a84-ad57-4a5b0c466433.png/size/"></p>
<p>As you can see, in these two games, the very populous languages Hindi (540 million), Malay (280 million), and Bengali (270 million) are invariably ignored. In addition, <em>GTA5</em> does not have Arabic. Instead, both games have German (180 million), Japanese (130 million), Italian (100 million), Korean (80 million), and Polish (50 million). The total number of speakers of these five languages is roughly equal to the number of Hindi speakers. Therefore, the choice of languages to adopt in the game is obviously not simply based on the number of speakers.</p>
<p>So, is it because of the purchasing power of players? Not necessarily. Among the 18 countries in the Arabic-speaking region, the combined GDP of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and Qatar alone is about the same as that of Italy. Among them, Saudi Arabia’s per capita GDP has reached 24,000 US dollars, and its consumption power is not much different from that of developed countries, not to mention Qatar, a country with a per capita GDP of more than 60,000 US dollars. Despite this, Arabic still does not appear in <em>GTA5</em>‘s language list. However, the potential player consumption power of this country also allows us to see the demand for Arabic from <em>GTA5</em> players in the Middle East on forums. Therefore, the language chosen by the game is not necessarily completely related to the purchasing power of players or specific regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F8690d5eb-ce73-4814-bbcb-e8668ac488c6.png/size/"></p>
<p>Faced with the demands of so many languages, the in-game language and the language of the in-game questionnaire must have made corresponding trade-offs and balances.</p>
<h2 id="2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires"><a href="#2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires" class="headerlink" title="2. Multi-language in Questionnaires"></a>2. Multi-language in Questionnaires</h2><p>So, how do you determine which languages to localize for overseas questionnaires? Let’s first look at the example of Arabic. Why haven’t many successful domestic games launched overseas done Arabic localization?</p>
<p>From the environment outside the game, although the video game industry and game culture in Arab countries are developing rapidly and there are many national support policies, they are still in the initial stage and have not been fully rolled out.  At the same time, although the Gulf countries are rich, the gap between the rich and the poor is very serious, and some countries are still in long-term war. Finally, many cultures or doctrines in Arab countries also conflict with game content or worldviews. Many manufacturers find it difficult to customize game content specifically for the Arab region in order to pursue efficiency and security.</p>
<p>From inside the game, students who have seen Arabic and have done game localization must know that Arabic localization is a thankless task: because of the different writing habits (from right to left) and different lengths of words and sentences, the UI design has to be almost redone for localization. The questionnaire system is no exception. Everything is read from right to left, and even the text will be “broken”. In addition, there are many religious and cultural nuances to be considered. Thus, the processing cost is huge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F28166350-8ddc-46c1-a5cb-38eeee8a755a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Breaking it down further into the design of overseas questionnaires, the core is still the same: the cost issue.</p>
<p>For a game like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which has already been launched and is operating, it currently supports 13 languages. When launching a questionnaire overseas for research, is it necessary to design corresponding 13 languages?</p>
<p>The answer is no. Ideally, it would be best if each language and its corresponding country or region had its own easily accessible questionnaire, but this would cause us to lose a great deal of timeliness: when considering horizontal comparisons between Chinese and foreign players, the questionnaire needs to be translated from Chinese to English after the needs are disassembled&#x2F;confirmed and the questions are designed, and then English is used as a bridge language to translate into various minor languages for distribution. Such a schedule often takes at least 1-2 weeks. After the questionnaire results are collected and the data is processed, it is necessary to compare and analyze 13 questionnaires in different languages, which is very cumbersome and error-prone, and may require the intervention of suppliers at this time. In this way, a questionnaire takes nearly a month to obtain valid data and conclusions, and players and the development team have long forgotten what they wanted to verify or investigate before, which will inevitably bring great timeliness problems.</p>
<p>In addition, considering that the number of players in different regions may vary greatly, when the number of samples collected for a certain minor language is limited, we must also consider the reliability and validity of the entire questionnaire when processing data. Feedback from a small number of player groups is very likely to provide biased conclusions or insights in a questionnaire that requires a large sample size, which is an important issue to consider in market and user research.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make some trade-offs. The first thing to consider is the number of online players in the game. To give an extreme example, if we have to choose between Japanese and Korean, and there are 1,000 players using Japanese and only 50 players using Korean, then we will undoubtedly give up including Korean in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>So, you might ask, what about Korean players? At this time, an English questionnaire can be used as a permanent alternative. Even if there are fewer English players, this universal language is always the “last home” for global players, and the same is true for overseas questionnaires. In the design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s overseas questionnaires, we will, considering the schedule of the localization team, add 2-3 minor languages on the basis of Chinese and English, combined with the number of online players, translation costs, and regional characteristics, as the final questionnaire launch.</p>
<h2 id="3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries"><a href="#3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries" class="headerlink" title="3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries"></a>3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries</h2><p>After arranging the multi-language questionnaire, let’s talk about the specific design of the questionnaire survey. The core point to pay attention to in this link is: Chinese players have their own unique game culture atmosphere, and other countries also have their own beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, when designing demographic questions, in addition to male and female genders in English questions, we also referred to the Inclusive Forms on gender proposed by UBC’s Equity &amp; Inclusion Office, adding gender options such as “non-binary” to the questions, and in fact, some players did choose this. On the other hand, in the Japanese and Korean language questionnaires, after consulting with localizers in those countries, if options other than male and female are added to the questions, players may feel a little strange, so we still only retain the traditional three options of “male&#x2F;female&#x2F;prefer not to disclose”, which also reflects the difference in values between East Asia and Europe and America. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F19652e40-1121-4403-b22a-de8c04ac5fba.png/size/"></p>
<p>This difference can also be reflected in the specific options of in-game questionnaires. If the option in a certain question is “good-looking hosts and commentators”, this is a relatively common situation in China. Because whether it is the high-end CCTV Spring Festival Gala host or the live broadcast anchors who are closer to life, these people are often good-looking and have good temperament, and the audience will not have any objections. However, when the same option appears in a European or American questionnaire, players may raise some objections. After all, in current European and American games, such as the protagonist of the console game <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the female characters in <em>Apex Legends</em>, they are already more diversified and no longer follow the sexy route like Lara Croft before. This gradual “different paths leading to different destinations” in aesthetics and differences in habits between the East and the West will also affect the setting of questions and options in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>In addition to similar value differences, the unique attributes of domestic questionnaires also need to be noted. For example, the “H5 page” option in domestic questionnaires is not well understood by overseas players. If it is literally translated as “H5” or “H5 page”, foreign players will be confused. At this time, we must consider whether to replace the option, or directly delete the option (when it is judged that it is less used in the region), or put it in the “other” option for players to fill in by themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0f89ec1b-b6d9-4a49-ab62-24659d723151.png/size/"></p>
<p>Of course, some of the most basic things, such as replacing domestic social platforms and media with overseas counterparts, will not be repeated here, but one thing to consider is: it is not just a matter of replacing them with a fixed set of content, but each language questionnaire should be localized according to the usage characteristics of that country. For example, “Allah” cannot appear in Arabic, this word cannot have the Christian cross; in German localization, “SS tier” needs to be considered more carefully when expressing equipment quality because “SS” is the abbreviation of Nazi “Schutzstaffel”, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is some preliminary discussion on the design and launch of overseas questionnaires. To sum up, a very important point is the word “trade-off”. Doing overseas research is of course important, but how to conduct questionnaire research efficiently during the research process is also something we need to consider. We can make corresponding optimal decisions according to the actual situation of our own games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Have you ever been fully immersed in a game, forgetting hunger and time?</em></p>
<p><em>Have you ever felt a sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction after finishing a game?</em></p>
<p><em>If so, congratulations. In this play session, you successfully entered a state of flow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F20cd7349-187a-4895-ae36-4ca9b3330a4c.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Nothing can stop Civilization VI players from the flow of “one more turn”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various psychological principles and phenomena, such as “flow”, have long been closely linked to the video game industry and have rich applications in it. In this article, we will combine specific game cases to explain how the “flow” phenomenon and the positive psychology theory behind it are introduced by game designers to support the game player experience.</p>
<p>First, let’s understand what positive psychology is.</p>
<h2 id="1-About-Positive-Psychology"><a href="#1-About-Positive-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="1. About Positive Psychology"></a>1. About Positive Psychology</h2><p>The core of positive psychology research is what makes life valuable and meaningful. As a discipline, it examines assumptions about what can improve our lives. Its research paradigm is no different from traditional psychology, only the focus of research is different: the traditional psychology field studies “what problems have occurred in human psychology” and tries to find ways to make them less painful; but the goal of positive psychology is to make ordinary life more fulfilling. It focuses on people’s strengths and explores what makes life happier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F1e395bbc-febe-4495-bc39-2e974a211650.png/size/"></p>
<p>Positive psychology is an important supplement to traditional psychology, focusing on the well-being of all mankind. Through its practice, we can be more actively involved in life and find the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>The core question of positive psychology research is how to make people happy, and this is the common fulcrum with video games. In the process of playing video games, players actively exert their rich and diverse strengths and skills to overcome difficulties; they empathize with the characters in the game, thus creating emotional connections; video games will also give them corresponding feedback, so that they can get a wonderful sense of happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what factors affect happiness and apply them to industry practices.</p>
<p>So what factors affect people’s happiness? In 2011, the father of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, proposed the very famous PERMA model in his book to explain the factors that affect happiness, and at the same time better define and explain “what is happiness”.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples"><a href="#2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples" class="headerlink" title="2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples"></a>2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples</h2><p>Professor Seligman, the “father of positive psychology”, believes that happiness consists of five elements: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0d4203fe-cd70-4b96-b147-ce0746fce43b.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Positive-Emotion"><a href="#Positive-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Positive Emotion"></a>Positive Emotion</h3><p>Studies have pointed out that positive emotions greatly affect the way we view the world. When the level of positive emotions is high, the level of creativity, courage, and optimism will increase: this means that players have stronger control performance in the game. At the same time, under the influence of positive emotions, players have higher cognition and evaluation of the game, and gain more satisfaction and happiness in the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to highlight the elements that can make people feel happy in the game and use them to mobilize the player’s positive emotions. For example, the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series produces a refreshing feeling for players during the race through the detailed depiction of the natural scenery of the United Kingdom and Mexico; the recent White Snake Legend co-branded fashion of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> stimulates players’ sense of national cultural pride and ownership while providing players with a beautiful visual experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F2922a14c-eb11-416f-b75b-6cf844864948.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2Faedc67cf-080e-463f-8e93-cda8b53d4149.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Engagement"><a href="#Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Engagement"></a>Engagement</h3><p>What makes you immersed in the game and even forget the time?</p>
<p>It is the “flow” mentioned earlier, proposed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, another founder of positive psychology. In positive psychology and PERMA theory, “flow” describes a state of immersion in the present and full engagement. When players are engaged, their energy and concentration increase at the same time. However, the state of flow is not something that can be entered casually. The game needs to meet the following three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game itself should be rewarding, and players tend to play the game. This is the big premise.</li>
<li>The challenges in the game should take into account the player’s ability. The challenges match the ability, which makes the player more engaged.</li>
<li>Players should feel that they have control over the game during the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F7da88dd9-07ff-4936-b2e8-984548ea61d2.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> and the <em>Civilization</em> series, which have always been regarded as industry benchmarks in the flow experience, also do well in these three points:</p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> provides players with a hearty gaming experience of cutting into flesh, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with a gaming experience of development and growth, and overall planning;</p>
<p>The difficulty of <em>Sekiro</em> is just on the upper side of the challenge-ability line of most players, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with up to 8 custom difficulties;</p>
<p>In <em>Sekiro</em>, players play the role of the ninja “Wolf” and constantly improve their combos and reactions during the game. In <em>Civilization</em>, players play the role of the supreme leader of a civilization and constantly optimize the best development strategy during the game.</p>
<p>Although <em>Sekiro</em> and <em>Civilization</em> belong to the action category and strategy category respectively, both have achieved the ultimate in their own fields, creating an immersive game experience for players. </p>

<h3 id="Relationship"><a href="#Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Relationship"></a>Relationship</h3><p>The revolutionary mentor Marx said: “Man is the sum of social relations.” Human beings are social animals and always have the need to maintain connections with others, hoping to have spiritual communication with others. At the same time, good interpersonal relationships often bring people a broader vision, stronger external support and a more stable psychological state.</p>
<p>The selection of game materials is rich and diverse, and naturally it will not lack the description of various social relations in various themes. Whether it is the deep emotional bond established between players and NPCs in single-player games, or the cooperative or competitive relationship established between players in online multiplayer games, it provides unique emotional experiences for players who love this type of game.</p>
<p>In the open-world single-player game <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> with a Western magical background, players will embark on the adventure of the Dragonborn. Among them, Lydia, the first companion encountered in Whiterun, is the partner of most players from beginning to end, accompanying the player to enter dark caves, sweep bandit strongholds, block knives and arrows for the player, share the burden of luggage for the player, share the ups and downs with the player, and accompany the player to travel all over the land of Skyrim. Because of this, Lydia has become almost one of the most talked about characters in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> and is deeply loved by players. In community-organized polls, Lydia firmly holds the title of “Most Popular Marriage Partner in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim”, which shows the deep emotional connection players have with her. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F503cd314-cc2d-4886-9426-f042c3cfdb62.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Battlefield 1</em>, which focuses on large maps and large battlefields, each battle is based on the historical battles of World War I. Players are divided into camps of 32 people, representing a participating country in World War I to fight for the country. At the beginning of the game, the monologue of the soldiers from that camp will be played to unify the players’ identification with the camp. In the game, players from the same country will mainly generate social links by helping each other, cross-covering, and coordinating charges. The gunfire and the bugle will firmly unite the players’ belief in “fighting for the country”. The grandeur of the charge, the bond between comrades-in-arms, and the belief in the country are all condensed in the short 20-minute game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F6884749b-98a0-49bd-8b55-7d45db135332.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Meaning-and-Purpose"><a href="#Meaning-and-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Meaning and Purpose"></a>Meaning and Purpose</h3><p>When a player has a clear goal, the goal will stimulate the player’s state. When the player has a clear sense of meaning and purpose, he will actively start thinking about how to do better, thus entering the positive cycle of “player input-game feedback-player thinking-player re-input”.</p>
<p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, the winner of the 2021 TGA Game of the Year, two players will play the role of Cody and May, a couple whose relationship is on the verge of breaking down. After another family quarrel, they are turned into dolls that their daughter cannot see by the daughter’s “Book of Love”. On the surface level, the player’s goal is to control the characters through the tasks set by the “Book of Love”, and finally return to their bodies and see their daughter; on the deeper level, the player’s goal is to let the two characters re-recognize and familiarize themselves with each other in the process of passing the levels, find the reason for loving each other, and thus save this family on the verge of breaking up. The pursuit of superficial meaning leads them on a journey of personal growth, thereby finding deeper meaning. The player’s play process is therefore tinged with a sense of mission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F155b4d55-78a1-4d35-bc6a-b339990c2fcb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Accomplishment"><a href="#Accomplishment" class="headerlink" title="Accomplishment"></a>Accomplishment</h3><p>Positive psychology believes that a sense of accomplishment can better improve a person’s resilience and optimism, and make people more courageous in the face of setbacks. Similarly, in the game, appropriately giving feedback to players on small achievements and big achievements can enhance players’ acceptance of challenges and resilience, increase their sense of gain and satisfaction during the game, and at the same time strengthen their motivation to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>The horizontal profile survival game <em>This War of Mine</em> won more than 100 international awards with its cold style, rigorous excavation of history and profound humanistic thinking. It starts from the perspective of small people in the war, takes the real event of the Siege of Sarajevo as the background, and makes players feel the pain, helplessness, and powerlessness of people in the war through a piece of microscopic cruel reality. This also makes the game have strong negative feedback on the player experience. Through the settlement of the small achievements of the player’s daily acquisition of materials and the settlement of the great achievements after the final clearance, the player can get hope for the next day’s survival and the motivation to explore the second week, reducing the risk of players giving up when facing negative emergencies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F68e28011-39f1-4963-b3a2-5e45fc3e3fc9.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Sid Meier, the master of the game industry, said at the 2010 GDC Game Developers Conference: “Games are a psychological experience”, which profoundly reveals the inseparable link between video games and psychology. The video game industry has developed to this day, and it has to be admitted that its greatest charm for game players is that it creates a rich, complex, immersive, and empathetic psychological experience for players. Although the psychological factors of the game process are not as dazzling as the game’s picture quality and action effects, its existence is the spiritual core of the interactive art of games.</p>

    <title>How to Create the Soul of FPS with Interaction - Gun Feel</title>
    <url>/2023/02/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20230220_28584_1074115/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230220/28584_1074115.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>FPS (First-Person Shooter), as a globally popular game genre, is deeply loved by players for its realistic battlefield atmosphere and exciting competitive confrontation. Every player has their own preferences, and when we evaluate an FPS game, gun feel is always an unavoidable aspect.</p>
<p>So what is gun feel? As a comprehensive feeling, it is difficult to define. It is an objective existence. How many game developers have racked their brains for it: all the feedback during the use of the gun can be included in the gun feel. It is also a subjective feeling in people’s minds: the player’s preconceived cognitive expectation of the gun’s “rules”. Only when the two match and cooperate with each other can a good gun feel be created.</p>
<p>For example, general FPS players perceive the AK as having a larger spread and strong recoil. If the shooting feedback fails to express this level of information, the player will feel that the gun is “weak”. It is difficult to change the player’s cognitive expectations. It is necessary to cater to the player by designing good gun use feedback, and this is the essence of improving gun feel.</p>
<p>All feedback is part of gun feel, but many players will first pay attention to some obvious information, such as gun model accuracy, shooting animation, sound effects, special effects, etc., but they know little about the role of interaction design in it. But it is certain that good interaction design can increase the realism and feel of the gun, and it also needs to be valued and carefully considered.</p>
<h2 id="1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake"><a href="#1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake" class="headerlink" title="1. Recoil System and Screen Shake"></a>1. Recoil System and Screen Shake</h2><p>When it comes to gun feel, many people will give priority to the recoil system of the gun. After all, this is the visual information that best reflects the power of the gun. But what are the manifestations of the recoil system?</p>
<h3 id="Viewkick"><a href="#Viewkick" class="headerlink" title="Viewkick"></a>Viewkick</h3><p>This is the most familiar part for FPS players. It refers to the camera that is constantly raised with continuous shooting, which is普遍存在 (pǔ biàn cún zài - universally present) in all shooting games. The generally-called “recoil control” is to control the recoil of this part. This is a form of recoil expression that almost all FPS games have. In terms of design, it is generally adjusted according to the recoil value of the gun, whether it is scoped, whether it is holding breath, the gun holding action, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F3be7f91f-957d-48b8-a513-d1bb906744b3.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Gunkick"><a href="#Gunkick" class="headerlink" title="Gunkick"></a>Gunkick</h3><p>Gunkick refers to the phenomenon that the crosshair continuously deviates from the center of the camera during continuous shooting, and the exit point of the bullet is tied to the crosshair, causing the impact point of the bullet to change accordingly. Its core lies in the constantly changing trajectory driven by the muzzle shake, which makes the entire shooting process very accurate and real, and can bring an extremely excellent shooting experience, but its implementation cost is also the highest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Fc4e2fe5b-4f10-463d-9e52-b259fa445606.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Visual-Recoil"><a href="#Visual-Recoil" class="headerlink" title="Visual Recoil"></a>Visual Recoil</h3><p>Visual recoil is similar to Gunkick, but different. It also refers to the crosshair deviating from the center of the camera, but it will return to the center of the screen before the next bullet is fired. It has no effect on the impact point of the bullet (which is always the center of the screen). It is just a visual expression. Simply put, Visual recoil is an animated version of muzzle jump and does not change the trajectory (and the fact is that Visual recoil is indeed a random play of multiple animations). It is enough for shooting games that pursue impact but not extreme accuracy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F3713ef6b-48bb-472b-b236-8177a21e69da.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Viewroll"><a href="#Viewroll" class="headerlink" title="Viewroll"></a>Viewroll</h3><p>Viewroll refers to the phenomenon of rotating around the center of the camera during shooting. It has no effect on the position of the crosshair and the camera, so it is just a visual effect to enhance recoil. Many FPS games in recent years have adopted it. From a design point of view, Viewkick reflects the vertical stability of the gun holder, then Viewroll reflects the horizontal stability. Therefore, the design ideas of these two are not much different. </p>

<h3 id="Spread"><a href="#Spread" class="headerlink" title="Spread"></a>Spread</h3><p>Spread refers to the phenomenon that bullets are randomly distributed on the diffusion circle with the aiming baseline A as the center. That is, aiming at one point, the bullet will not necessarily hit that point, but there will be an unavoidable deviation. It is achieved by directly modifying the code to displace the bullet by a small distance at a long distance. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the recoil performance system, but in design, it can be used as a supplement to Visual recoil to undertake the task of randomly distributing the trajectory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F88dc50e5-291c-475d-8543-637a8d4ac200.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>Viewkick and Gunkick are the performance of recoil on the aiming baseline, which actually affects the player’s aiming; Spread is to directly modify the position of the bullet to achieve the “offset” feeling in the recoil system; Visual recoil and Viewroll are just visual expressions and have no factual impact on the player’s aiming and shooting (but may still form visual misleading).</p>
<p>Perhaps after talking about the above points, many readers are still confused about the interactive performance of the recoil system. Next, we will use game comparisons to illustrate how the recoil system affects the gun feel from the player’s interactive experience.</p>
<p>First, a horizontal comparison between <em>Battlefield 1</em> and <em>Battlefield V</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F60395801-84d4-435d-b444-a63dade1d9aa.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Comparing the above two animated pictures, which gun do you think has a stronger sense of power?</p>
<p>Many readers will choose <em>Battlefield 1</em> on the right. The reason is that as works of the Battlefield series, the bullet exit points of both are tied to the center of the screen, but because <em>Battlefield 1</em> has Visual recoil, which <em>Battlefield V</em> does not have, its crosshair can move additionally away from the center of the screen, and it has a stronger sense of power in the performance layer of recoil. At the same time, <em>Battlefield 1</em> also has a larger Spread, which enhances the thrill of strafing.</p>
<p>The above two points give <em>Battlefield 1</em> a better shooting experience, but also produced a problem that has been criticized by players, that is, the crosshair of <em>Battlefield 1</em> is deceptive. Aiming but not hitting is the main source of frustration in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. Therefore, DICE studio canceled these two points in the development of <em>Battlefield V</em> in exchange for a “point and shoot” PVP kill experience, and at the same time adopted a larger Viewkick to make up for the shortcomings in the shooting experience.</p>
<p>The above comparison tells us that performance (gun feel) and operation (shooting accuracy) are difficult to balance, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> series (hereinafter referred to as COD) gives a better solution to this problem, that is, Gunkick. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Ff0c07ea2-76f9-4c71-bd9a-efd3364be5c7.gif/size/"></p>
<p>First of all, COD also has the offset between the crosshair and the center of the screen, but unlike the Visual recoil of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the bullet exit point of COD is tied to the crosshair, that is, Gunkick. This offset will not mislead the player’s aiming, because the player’s reference point when making fine-tuning aiming is always the crosshair. In addition, Gunkick can also replace the random effect of Spread’s trajectory, and there will be no problem of erratic trajectory like Spread, which can be described as the best of both worlds. Of course, the disadvantage of Gunkick is that it is difficult to balance cost and performance. Only FPS game industry ceilings like COD can better control it.</p>
<h2 id="2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design"><a href="#2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Crosshair and Sight Design"></a>2. Crosshair and Sight Design</h2><p>I believe that players of any FPS game will find a strange phenomenon, that is, when we watch games or live broadcasts, we always find that some players or anchors set the crosshair to some strange shapes. After logging in to the game, I also tried the same, but found that other people’s settings were not as good as my own, and the default crosshair felt better. What is going on? In fact, the design of the crosshair and the sight also includes the careful consideration of the interaction designer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F7deaa0d6-5fea-4f3d-8416-1d73c22e5da2.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental"><a href="#Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental" class="headerlink" title="Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental"></a>Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental</h3><p>The form of the UI is closely related to its function. To answer this question, we must first return to the original design purpose and function of the crosshair - to assist players in aiming at the enemy. A simple sentence can actually be divided into two steps: First, find the position of your own crosshair and the enemy, and move the crosshair to the enemy; second, fine-tune the crosshair to aim at a certain part of the enemy (such as the head) and shoot. Although many FPS veterans are already proficient in shooting and are not aware of the process, they still cannot do without these two steps.</p>
<p>From this, it can be found that the crosshair that contains the larger area is easier to achieve the first step; and the smaller and more precise the crosshair, the easier it is to achieve the second step. This is also the reason why some professional players like to shrink the crosshair: for them, the first step no longer needs any guidance, what they need is to aim at the enemy’s weakness more accurately. In fact, the default crosshair of <em>CS: GO</em> takes into account the above two steps: the small point in the middle is used for precise aiming; the cross around it is used to expand the overall area for rough aiming. Therefore, most players do not need to adjust the default crosshair, and the interaction designer has already considered it thoroughly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F73ada4c3-75fb-4245-b6a8-4503bb3d11cb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Form-Follows-Function"><a href="#Form-Follows-Function" class="headerlink" title="Form Follows Function"></a>Form Follows Function</h3><p>In recent years, with the development of FPS game design and technology, some strange crosshair styles have appeared in the player’s field of vision, but in the final analysis, it is still form follows function.</p>
<p>The crosshair has been around for the longest time. It contains a horizontal headshot line and is widely used in weapons that require precise shooting and pre-aiming; the circular crosshair is suitable for suppression. It clearly indicates the scattering range and is used in melee combat, with AOE damage, and guns that do not require precision; there are also crosshairs with parabolic scales, which are obviously used in some weapons with obvious bullet drop, such as bows and arrows, grenade launchers, etc. These crosshair styles are the most authentic feedback of the weapon, and some even borrowed from the sight of the weapon in reality. They deeply affect the first impression of a gun and also affect the player’s feeling of gun feel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F525528be-d8f2-4090-9f4e-970095378dd1.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Hit-Feedback"><a href="#3-Hit-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="3. Hit Feedback"></a>3. Hit Feedback</h2><p>As the last step of the player’s interaction with the gun, the existence of hit feedback is a great positive incentive. The enemy’s hit action, particle effects, sound effects and other multi-sensory forms of expression constitute the current mainstream FPS hit feedback.</p>
<p>But due to the limitations of many competitive games, for example, in fast-paced games like <em>Overwatch</em>, it is impossible to show the enemy’s hit animation separately for the player, and the hit special effects are also greatly reduced; in <em>CS: GO</em>, in order to ensure the fairness of the competition, animation and special effects are also simplified as much as possible. At this time, interaction designers need to take action to provide certain hit feedback on the UI.</p>
<h3 id="Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross"><a href="#Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross" class="headerlink" title="Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross"></a>Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross</h3><p>In the hit feedback on the UI, most of them are currently attached to the crosshair: when hitting the enemy, an “x” cross will appear on the crosshair, and different variants will present different information. These variants are the focus of the design.</p>
<p>The COD series uses a set of cognitive habits that players have formed for design: when your shot hits the enemy, a white “x” cross appears around the crosshair; if this hit is a kill, the “x” cross appears red; when you attack continuously, the animation of the “x” cross is flashing. Most games on the market currently use this set of UI hit feedback design. Although it is traditional, it is stable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F94824c4a-1953-4847-b829-c02881a7c1bd.gif/size/"></p>
<p><em>Overwatch</em> has made certain innovations: the white “x” cross still indicates a hit, and the red “x” cross is changed to a hit on a weak point, so it is necessary to design another icon to indicate a kill. Overwatch chose the most intuitive red skull. At the same time, Overwatch has also improved the animation performance of the “x” cross under continuous attack, from monotonous “flashing” to increasing the side length of the “x” cross to express the accumulation of damage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F4b9bf058-8d3f-403c-87f0-828c378ae454.gif/size/"></p>
<p>What’s more, such as <em>Biomutant</em>, the hit feedback is directly mounted on the enemy instead of the UI, which makes the hit feedback out of the scope of the UI interface, but more like a stylized special effect. But compared with the former with a fixed position, mounting the hit feedback on the enemy can better reflect the flexibility of the battle and has a better performance in PVE.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Gun feel, as the soul of FPS, is something that every game company must carefully consider and design when making this type of game. A good shooting feel can greatly enhance the coherence and interactivity of the game process and lay the foundation for a good player experience. This is a complex and arduous project. Although interaction only accounts for a small proportion of it, its role should not be underestimated. Whether it is recoil performance, crosshair, or hit feedback, it is what players pay attention to and value. It is believed that with the development of FPS games, more interaction designers will invest in these fields of work and propose more solutions for better gun feel.</p>

    <title>I came, I saw, I conquered Localization Strategies to Help Arabic Games Go Global</title>
    <url>/2023/02/17/netease-ux-articles/news_20230220_28584_1074117/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230220/28584_1074117.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>McDonald’s has opened chain restaurants in more than 100 countries, which is globalization. McDonald’s restaurants in Israel are closed on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. McDonald’s in Dubai uses Arabic to transliterate McDonald’s and designs different menus to cater to Muslims who do not eat pork. This is localization.</p>
<p>As more and more products go global, researchers have created the acronym GILT (Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and Translation) to refer to the activities that companies engage in when they go abroad to do business. Among these words, “translation” is the easiest to understand. Anthony Burgess once said: “Translation is not a matter of words only: it is a matter of making intelligible a whole culture.”</p>
<p>Arabic, as the fifth most spoken language in the world, includes more than 30 different dialects. Millennials, as the main Internet audience, have a growing demand for Arabic video games, leading to more and more game localization services focusing on Arabic. However, Arabic is also considered one of the most difficult languages to localize. Its richness, diversity, and complexity make the localization of games challenging. Compared with major languages such as English, there is a extreme lack of linguistic technology adapted to Arabic. Although all Arab countries speak the same language and believe in roughly the same religion, in fact, the complex multicultural structure makes these countries very different.</p>
<h2 id="1-Adapt-to-the-Technical-Characteristics-of-the-Target-Language-to-Avoid-Potential-Technical-Problems-in-the-Localized-Version"><a href="#1-Adapt-to-the-Technical-Characteristics-of-the-Target-Language-to-Avoid-Potential-Technical-Problems-in-the-Localized-Version" class="headerlink" title="1. Adapt to the Technical Characteristics of the Target Language to Avoid Potential Technical Problems in the Localized Version"></a>1. Adapt to the Technical Characteristics of the Target Language to Avoid Potential Technical Problems in the Localized Version</h2><h3 id="BiDi-Bi-directional-The-Complexity-of-Text-Sorting"><a href="#BiDi-Bi-directional-The-Complexity-of-Text-Sorting" class="headerlink" title="BiDi (Bi-directional): The Complexity of Text Sorting"></a>BiDi (Bi-directional): The Complexity of Text Sorting</h3><p>Perhaps the most well-known textual feature of Arabic is that it is arranged from right to left. In the Pixar film <em>Inside Out</em>, there is a scene where the characters in the film point to a sign and read the text on it. This part of the animation content has been modified for different versions. In the Arabic version of the movie, the characters read the sign from right to left, while in the English version, the reading order is from left to right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Fe37c3b3b-d180-42a4-8d86-83e888cfa203.png/size/"></p>
<p>In most cases, Arabic is written and read from right to left. However, in some contexts, certain parts of a sentence are written and read from left to right. For example, when numbers and Latin text appear in a sentence, which is common in video games. This makes Arabic a bi-directional (BiDi) language, and Arabic text in any localization software should also reflect this feature. Some video games do not support BiDi, which brings difficulties to the corresponding Arabic version experience. This complexity becomes even more serious when numbers, Latin words, and certain symbols appear in a line or sentence.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the BiDi text display error that appeared in the Xbox One version of <em>PUBG</em>. When a player dies, a message pops up saying “M416 [weapon] killed you with a headshot by J*****8 [player name]”, which does not make sense in Arabic. So in fact, the internationalization stage of the GILT process includes preparing the source code of the game in advance to facilitate and support localization. It can be understood as eliminating or modifying problematic elements of the game upstream, including technical or cultural issues. The Arabic version of the game needs to support BiDi to adapt to the Arabic RTL text direction. The error that appears here is a typical example of the game code preparation or design not supporting Arabic translation&#x2F;localization tasks. </p>

<h3 id="Letter-Connection-and-Right-to-Left-Layout"><a href="#Letter-Connection-and-Right-to-Left-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Letter Connection and Right-to-Left Layout"></a>Letter Connection and Right-to-Left Layout</h3><p>Arabic writing is connected. This writing style requires code or engine support in the game. Such a system will ensure that the Arabic script in the game is displayed correctly, with all letters connected and read from right to left. Some localized games from well-known developers such as Konami do not support Arabic cursive, which makes it difficult for Arabic players to read certain menu items.</p>
<p>In <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em>, developed by Konami, some menu items do not support Arabic cursive. As shown in the figure below, “العب الان” (Play Now), which is displayed correctly, is disconnected because these letters are disconnected and displayed from left to right. However, other menu items are displayed correctly. This script problem was fixed after release, which cost Konami more money, effort, and time. </p>

<p>The problem of disconnecting Arabic letters becomes more serious and destructive when video games contain voice-over subtitles. The figure below is <em>Maquette</em> developed by Graceful Decay. In the game, the Arabic in the main menu and subtitles is completely disconnected. </p>

Customize Localized UI Design and Terminology Unification from User Habits and Cultural Characteristics</h2><p>In addition to the obvious problems of right-to-left and letter connection, carefully scrutinizing every use experience from the user’s habits is a kind of silent localization service.</p>
<h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>The lack of subtitle specifications is not only a problem for Arabic video game localization, but also for other languages. However, the nature of Arabic makes this lack of standardization more serious.</p>
<p>Arabic does not include capital letters to indicate proper names, but occasionally uses punctuation marks to compensate. In order to distinguish between proper nouns and other words, Arabic translators usually choose parentheses or inverted commas. Many video games have adopted this practice. For example, proper nouns in <em>The Witcher 3</em> are enclosed in parentheses; in <em>FIFA 2018</em>, proper names are retained in the source language, which is especially problematic for players who do not speak or read foreign languages; in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, line breaks and color-coding of proper names are used to distinguish NPC names. </p>

<p>Some localization experts believe that using punctuation marks in sentences to distinguish proper nouns from other words is awkward. However, it is difficult for players to read transliterated proper nouns and distinguish them from other words, because some transliterated words look like Arabic verbs or adjectives. Using punctuation marks to uniformly distinguish proper nouns can often improve the readability of audiovisual text and reduce confusion. In fact, it is common to use quotation marks and&#x2F;or parentheses to enclose proper nouns in local TV programs or movies with Arabic subtitles. The same practice and its advantages also apply to in-game text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F70a56080-5fac-424e-a0de-1dd19a77e106.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Transliteration"><a href="#Transliteration" class="headerlink" title="Transliteration"></a>Transliteration</h3><p>Another key issue in Arabic video game localization is the translation and transliteration of proper nouns (names of people or places). This problem stems from the fact that people have different ways of translating English proper nouns into Arabic. For example, in some cases, translators will replace the letters of the source word with the same letters in Arabic. In other cases, the translator replaces the pronunciation of the source word with the pronunciation in Arabic, or provides a translation of the proper noun. Due to the lack of standardized methods for translating proper nouns into Arabic, proper nouns appear less frequently in different types of translation materials, including video games, movies, TV shows, and literary works. For example, Skellige, a city in <em>The Witcher 3</em>, is transliterated in three different ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F076ef0b0-5d45-4014-93e2-dc0bc7de1190.png/size/"></p>
<p>When players face three different transliterations at the same time on the screen: one for his&#x2F;her location in the game world map; one for the list, at a specific task location; and one for the voice-over subtitles, at the bottom of the screen. However, in translation and localization projects, there is no standardized method for translating foreign names. In some localization processes, the Arabic transliteration of proper nouns needs to be managed during terminology development, which helps ensure that specific transliterations are used consistently throughout the project.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Game-Terminology-and-Acronyms"><a href="#Video-Game-Terminology-and-Acronyms" class="headerlink" title="Video Game Terminology and Acronyms"></a>Video Game Terminology and Acronyms</h3><p>When translating games into Arabic, video game developers also need to consider two other elements: the length of Arabic equivalent terms, especially video game menu terms, and the absence of acronyms in Arabic. Therefore, compared with English, translating interface items into Arabic requires more space.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the “Home” button in the English and Arabic versions of <em>Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions</em>. “الصفحة الرئيسية” in Arabic requires two lines and 15 characters, while only one line and 4 characters are required in English. </p>

<p>Video game localization has some similarities with software localization. Both involve a combination of language translation and software engineering, that is, the translated text string needs to be properly placed in the software. This requires that the string length is within the allocated space, which in turn limits the freedom of translation. The model of releasing the original product (usually the English version) together with the localized version is an accepted model in today’s localization industry, but it has important implications for translation, because translators must deal with unstable source content that may be constantly changing throughout the project. Most games released in Europe seem to follow this model, rather than the model where the localized version lags behind the original version. The latter is common among Japanese game developers&#x2F;publishers.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Taboos-Haram"><a href="#Cultural-Taboos-Haram" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Taboos (Haram)"></a>Cultural Taboos (Haram)</h3><p>Arab culture is very conservative in terms of sex, alcohol, and profanity. In addition, in most cases, topics that violate Arab and Muslim cultural and religious beliefs will be reviewed by the Arab Audiovisual Commission (GCAM) for these issues. If the material cannot be reviewed, it will be completely banned. Several games have been banned in Arab countries due to content that does not conform to Arab cultural norms and traditions. For example, some video games that have been banned in the Arab region due to violence and mention of sexual orientation include <em>Assassin’s Creed 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>, <em>Deadpool</em>, and <em>Mafia 3</em>. There are also some other games that have been rejected or even banned by Arab players due to implicit or explicit insults to Muslims.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> is a good example. This game caused controversy in the Arab Muslim player community. Players found that the frame pattern above the toilet in a bathroom scene in the game quoted the Quran. In Islam, it is forbidden to talk about Islam in the toilet. In response to the player community, Activision officially apologized and modified this scene in a game update. </p>

<p>This is not the first time that Islamic elements have appeared in the Call of Duty series of games. In the zombie mode of <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, players found that the Quran was thrown on the floor and stepped on by players; such a rude scene angered players in the Arab region, forcing game developers to delete it in an update. Independent game developer Rami Ismail tweeted: “Even if you think religion is nonsense, there is no reason to be disrespectful to the culture and beliefs of 2 billion people in a video game, just in exchange for a disposable asset.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F596d184a-beae-48ee-8074-fae1a64d6ed0.png/size/"></p>

<p>When games are developing localized Arabic versions, development teams should carefully consider these issues. Development should follow the cultural norms of the Arabic-speaking region to avoid sales losses due to cultural dissonance and negative impact on the developer’s image in certain markets.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Localization is the process of making a product or information resonate with a specific target culture, in the same way that content is created locally. Several of the above-mentioned problems of Arabic localization can be reduced and avoided by adopting appropriate internationalization strategies. Game localization should also be based on Gouadec’s definition of localization, that is, adapting a product to “the specific physical, technical, linguistic, cultural, ethnic, religious, philosophical, commercial, marketing, etc. conditions and requirements of the audience or users of a specific ‘location’.”</p>
<p>In other words, the process of game localization should not only consider the language conversion of game resources, but also consider the cultural background of the corresponding market, including the corresponding norms to manage the acceptability of localization in overseas video game markets. These investments also depend on the level of localization that video game developers expect, the return on investment in localization based on time constraints, and considerations of the value of the target market. In general, given the huge market demand for video games from users in the Arab region, there is an urgent need for more research and experimentation in the field of Arabic game localization.</p>

    <title>The More Cowardly, the More Addicted - Are Horror Games Really That Appetizing</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Horror games, a genre that has endured since the birth of gaming, remain a favorite of many game enthusiasts. While our rational minds tell us to avoid fear in pursuit of happiness, the chilling, trembling feeling we get in the dark provides a thrilling and captivating experience.</p>
<p>Horror games are truly a love-hate affair. When you’re not playing them, you’re intrigued by the sense of curiosity, but when you are, you’re constantly gripped by fear.  From classics like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>, to the rising tide of Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em>, <em>Paper Dolls</em>, and <em>Paper Bride</em>, this genre has always had titles that touch players’ nerves.  Even when scared pale, players persevere to complete the entire story.  What is the driving force behind players’ dedication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F1cf04caa-4c02-4070-8488-3ba573afee74.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games"><a href="#1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?"></a>1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?</h2><h3 id="Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster"><a href="#Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster" class="headerlink" title="Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster"></a>Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster</h3><p>Horror games aim to shock or frighten the audience through narrative devices such as pain and supernatural phenomena. Players experience anxiety and even disgust, accompanied by a series of physiological reactions, such as trembling, jumping, covering their eyes, and an increased heart rate, resulting in feelings of fear.  When faced with terror, the sympathetic nervous system is aroused, activating the fight-or-flight response, and the level of adrenaline in the body surges.  However, people usually don’t immediately flee danger. The brain assesses the surrounding environment, and after realizing there is no immediate danger, emotions relax, providing a sense of release.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s like a roller coaster. You experience a range of emotions, such as anticipation and tension, and then, under the stimulation of adrenaline, a series of physiological reactions occur, such as accelerated blood flow, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, dilated pupils, and focused attention on self-preservation. The brain and body prepare to react to perceived threats with greater strength and speed. After assessing that there is no real life-threatening danger, dopamine and endorphins are activated, resulting in a thrilling pleasure and mental catharsis.</p>
<p>Horror games take full advantage of this by manipulating and teasing the senses, scaring you, and then providing a moment of relief. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F639e7cda-5341-45e8-bf0b-264751299fa1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms"><a href="#Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms"></a>Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms</h3><p>Imagine you’re running for your life in the game world of <em>Resident Evil</em>, your health bar is almost empty, you don’t have many supplies left, and to make matters worse, there’s a猙狞 (zhēngníng - ferocious,狰狞) looking tracker who wants to kill you immediately following you.  At this point, you just want to run into the nearest safe room. When you hear the beautiful melody, you breathe a sigh of relief. This safe room design and the overwhelming sense of relief are actually key elements that make horror games appealing.  After experiencing an adrenaline rush and successfully escaping danger, with the release of dopamine, the player’s tension is relieved, muscles relax, and there is often an “electrified” effect after the fright.</p>
<p>Dolf Zillmann’s “Excitation-Transfer Theory” explains this cycle of tension and relief. Because horror games can effectively make players feel fear and unease, when they get rid of fear, the subsequent feeling of relief from excitement is amplified. This is why many games have safe room designs, not only to provide players with a safe haven from harm, but also to enhance the player’s emotions and strengthen the experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F86cecd5f-8094-4753-aecd-b05ff738967e.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts"><a href="#2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?"></a>2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?</h2><p>So, since our bodies physiologically determine that when we face fear, a sense of excitement or fun will naturally follow the feeling of terror, how do games create horror?</p>
<p>In today’s horror games, even the traditional Western-style bloody and straightforward scares, which emphasize the visual horror created by zombies and mutants, are just auxiliary tools. Atmosphere and immersion are what games pursue, by finding resonance with players to achieve the purpose of engagement.</p>
<h3 id="Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions"><a href="#Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions"></a>Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions</h3><p>Through modern medical scanning techniques, the brain regions involved in emotional processing, which in horror games correspond to fear recognition or processing, are most related to the amygdala and hippocampus. Horror games are not 100% jump scares and terrifying murders. Games like to leave you in suspense, which is where elements like suspense and sound design come into play.  When eerie music enters the ears, even without directly seeing terrifying images and things, it sends a signal to our nervous system, the amygdala is activated to produce fear. At this time, we don’t have any background clues to explain what we should be afraid of, and the hippocampus will retrieve memories and fill in the blanks based on our personal fears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F7bb137fc-2f5b-4594-b087-1d45355cd4c1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories"><a href="#Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories"></a>Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories</h3><p>So, what are we afraid of in our memories?  Each cultural context has its own corresponding “nightmares”, such as the chainsaw murderers in Europe and America, Sadako in Japan, and Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil. These are often the design prototypes in various horror games. Or, like the ghost marriages and red candles and paper money in Chinese horror, we instinctively feel a chill and our hearts race.  For example, most people are afraid of dimly lit environments, sudden ringing phones, baby cries, and other scenes, which are guaranteed to scare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Fdd26971f-807a-41bb-83b7-58e94d76a9e6.png/size/"></p>
<p>The most terrifying things often happen in familiar areas. When a horror game takes place in a familiar building, and the game creates a depressing atmosphere, accompanied by a slow-paced early game and a large number of puzzle-solving elements, then it gives the player a fatal blow at the climax of the plot.  Although there are not so many sensory stimuli, it will make you replay it in your mind.  This chilling fear is the most charming part of psychological horror, making countless players “unable to stop”.</p>
<h2 id="3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players"><a href="#3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players"></a>3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players</h2><p>In recent years, the resurgence of horror games, and the reboot trend, is also thanks to the rise of the streaming industry.</p>
<p>Horror games seem to be born for streaming, naturally suitable for creating content. Streamers have also perfectly interpreted “the more cowardly, the more addicted”. This has further promoted the prevalence of horror games in the streaming industry. After all, which streamer doesn’t like outstanding “streaming effects”?  Unlike other games, narrative-based games require the entire playthrough to be watched for story appreciation, and strategy games require long-term experience to truly engage. Horror games are different. When streamers show their off-guard reactions on screen, it brings a strong sense of comedic contrast to the audience, while also driving traffic for the streamer and providing free advertising for the game, allowing horror games, which were once niche and only suitable for private experience, to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>For example, popular Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em> and <em>Paper Dolls</em> have been played by well-known streamers like PDD, Qiezi, and even some esports players during their streams.  Or, when searching for horror games on Bilibili, you will also find many videos of streamers playing or explaining the game.  The rise of new media such as live streaming and video has indeed injected a boost into the horror industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F64aabcd3-1b88-4822-b5ad-2dbf10e5901c.png/size/"></p>
<p>As a viewer, when you have a favorite streamer who screams in terror while playing this game, you will naturally be interested in this game and take the initiative to learn about horror games. Human emotions are interconnected, and joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness can easily be spread to others through various forms. As a viewer, I might be scared to play, but I’m definitely not afraid to watch a stream.  When the streamer is startled, the audience will also feel their palms sweat, which is also a kind of emotional connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort"><a href="#4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort" class="headerlink" title="4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort"></a>4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort</h2><p>Horror games, as a broad category, may include various gameplay forms in their core. However, in the external presentation of these games, developers need to be wary of cruel and extreme art design. Causing players physiological discomfort may detract from the visual experience.  From the terrifying presentation of monsters, the basic principles of their construction, and the player’s coping methods, more in-depth design should be carried out, and early combination with player testing for corresponding adjustments can reduce the risk of negative reviews in later releases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F5f04f593-8306-4502-97e1-661b709e543d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Last December, <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, created by the main creators of <em>Dead Space</em>, was released and was considered by many players to be the spiritual successor to <em>Dead Space</em>. Although in terms of art design, the development team fully utilized the performance of next-generation consoles, and based on the company’s strengths (the producer is an art director), the visual effects were greatly improved, but some players experienced physiological discomfort and the singular horror and combat experience created by the game did not receive very good reviews.</p>
<h2 id="5-Will-Horror-Continue"><a href="#5-Will-Horror-Continue" class="headerlink" title="5. Will Horror Continue?"></a>5. Will Horror Continue?</h2><p>For a game, repeatedly stacking horror elements does not guarantee success. As mentioned above, when players enter the feedback loop of expecting fear, sudden fright, and releasing happiness in the safe room, the fear response is constantly triggered.  This feedback loop often exists in every horror game. After you face a hellhound that has scared you once, the second time you encounter a similar scene, your brain is prepared for that moment, just like a drug, you develop “tolerance.”</p>
<p>When we activate the fight-or-flight response, a complex neurotransmitter response is activated, producing a neurochemical cascade. Like drugs, long-term use requires more of the drug to produce the effect.  Thrill-seeking players may also develop increased “fear tolerance,” thus requiring more and more fear stimulation to produce the desired response.</p>
<p>As most players say, a certain game has nothing new and is always “rehashing old ideas”. For horror games, if they want to endure and win the hearts of players, they also need to change the way they scare, otherwise players will only say “this plot design is the same as xxx”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ffb714065-c86c-4d89-9a28-4bcec46fb00a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Currently, many horror games have attracted a lot of attention. However, the cruel fact contrary to high popularity is that most current horror games are critically acclaimed but not commercially successful. The reason is still simply “scares”.  They are both afraid and curious, so instead of playing themselves, most people prefer to watch others play with the protection of bullet comments (referring to live comments that scroll across the screen on streaming platforms).</p>
<p>But now, with more expressive forms and gameplay attracting players to horror games, more and more players want to try them.  Initially, they may be scared and develop resistance to the game, but now, after seeing new and unique horror elements and gameplay, they may develop new interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps horror games still cannot shake the market position of other game genres, but under the trend of the times, horror games still have great potential. We also look forward to more powerful technology, more diverse scenes and gameplay being introduced into horror games. </p>

    <title>How Can Interface and Interaction Help Players Quickly Get Started with a New Game</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230222/28584_1074591.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Besides the game’s own fun and playability, the speed at which novice players get started is also one of the major factors that determine the fate of a game. In the player’s onboarding phase, the game designer has a lot of information that needs to be communicated to the player, including the story background, game goals, basic operations, etc., which is the so-called “novice guidance”. The transmission of such information requires interaction designers to make ingenious designs to ensure its accuracy and fluency, so as to minimize the player’s memory burden, improve acceptance and onboarding efficiency, and then make the player have the willingness to continue playing.</p>
<p>This article will discuss several key points of interaction design that need to be paid attention to in novice guidance, and analyze them in combination with cases.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative"><a href="#1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative"></a>1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative</h2><p>First, we need to understand two related concepts. “Weakly positive” and “strongly negative”.</p>
<p>“Weakly positive” means that it is extremely difficult for novice guidance to gain the attention and favor of players. Although excellent novice guidance will allow players to complete the onboarding phase efficiently and smoothly, and have a willingness to continue playing the game, because it is a guide when entering a game, it does not occupy a dominant position like the game’s own plot advancement, so players do not often pay attention to this novice guidance, nor do they often pay attention to the changes in their attitude towards the game during this stage, and they do not often make positive comments such as “the novice guidance of this game is really good”.</p>
<p>“Strongly negative” means that if a novice guide is not done well, it is very likely to directly dissuade novice players. Novice guidance is equivalent to the gate of the whole game. If the threshold is too high, or the receptionist is too tough, leading visitors to visit hand in hand, and so on, visitors are very likely to become dissatisfied and leave. Novice guidance receives less attention, but it is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance"><a href="#2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance"></a>2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance</h2><h3 id="Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance"><a href="#Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Non-mandatory: Open Guidance"></a>Non-mandatory: Open Guidance</h3><p>When encountering a new game, players often encounter “nanny-level” novice tutorials - the screen pauses, a conspicuous arrow appears on the interface to guide the player to click here (and only this place is interactive, unable to exit), and there are text descriptions of varying lengths. Obviously, this method is too rigid and will easily reduce the player’s favorability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some players may have already learned about the game through other accounts, watching game videos, etc., so they do not need to learn the novice guidance, which designers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, good novice guidance interaction should be non-mandatory and open. Players can freely explore in the game scene and spontaneously complete the learning of interaction methods. Of course, in some games under specific categories, or in some parts of the game’s novice guidance, mandatory guidance is more applicable, because this form can relatively effectively ensure that all players master and understand certain key mechanisms or story plots.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Stray</em>, the play between kittens is used as the beginning of the story. Because it was raining at that time, the kittens’ activities were limited to the cave that could shelter from the rain, but in this space, players can freely explore and learn basic actions such as walking and interacting with other cats. Except for the necessary key prompts, there are no obvious interactions set in this scene, and players seem to have integrated into the open world of cats without human language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F91faa065-cf58-46e2-9eb3-523658c8cffb.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Rainy night, players freely interact with NPCs in the cave</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Learning-Through-Practice"><a href="#Learning-Through-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Learning Through Practice"></a>Learning Through Practice</h3><p>Novice tutorials are not necessarily textbook-like systematic teaching. It can also break through the inherent form and integrate into actual combat, learning through practice. Therefore, what we describe as “novice tutorials” may be more appropriately referred to as “novice guidance”. Players gradually learn a variety of skills and gameplay as the plot progresses, which is very helpful for the smoothness and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Necessary prompts and interactions should be integrated into the scene, which can be viewed by players at any time, and hardly affect the progress of their game.</p>
<p>In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, there is no formed novice tutorial, but learning while playing. When players play for the first time, they will fall into one of the pre-selected maps - Mansion (of course it is the simplest of all maps), and directly start exploring the game world. During the process, players will occasionally encounter conspicuous orange items on the ground. When it is picked up, a projection screen-like floating animation appears in the scene, teaching players the relevant operations at this moment. Whether to pick it up and when to put it down is entirely up to the player, respecting and encouraging players to explore on their own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ffe0dee3f-39a7-4e39-a813-5d60adf74762.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Pick up the “tutorial video” to play the guidance content</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Toto Temple Deluxe</em>, there is a very important dash action, which needs to be pressed “arrow keys + dash key” to complete. The training of this action has already begun before the game - game settings, mode selection and other preparations all need to control the villain to dash to complete the interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F07a26c5a-63b6-456f-abd4-5366ae8296fe.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Dash to complete interaction and action training</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Ingenious-Unconscious-Design"><a href="#Ingenious-Unconscious-Design" class="headerlink" title="Ingenious Unconscious Design"></a>Ingenious Unconscious Design</h3><p>To make the novice guidance more brilliant, it is necessary to design more hidden teaching elements and methods that players are not aware of.</p>
<p>Unconscious action is an action that a person can make without much thought and subconsciously. Unconscious design is an extremely simple design that captures this natural characteristic of users. It does not require a lot of artificially added interaction, and can quickly guide users to unconsciously complete a certain task. Applying it to the game novice tutorial can be roughly summarized as: using natural and ingenious implicit interaction to guide players.</p>
<p>In <em>Stray</em>, cans begin to appear on the kitten’s path, prompting the player to push them down from a height. At first, this action did not produce any feedback from the event. When the player was confused, they thought of the reality that kittens are like this, unreasonably pushing things off the table, cute and mischievous. This method not only evokes a strong resonance from the player, but also teaches the player the correct use of cans in the game. Then, a glass skylight blocked the way, and there happened to be a can on the high platform above it… </p>

<p>Like the teaching of all knowledge and skills, game tutorials cannot output all the gameplay and rules of this game to novice players at once. When they first come into contact with new things, players need a process of understanding and acceptance. In this process, the game designer leads the player from easy to difficult, from simple to complex, and gradually enters the worldview of this game.</p>
<p>For example, one of the important contents of the ocean exploration game <em>Dave The Diver</em> is to go to the sea to fish. The game first teaches players the most basic left-click stab, and then long-press the right-click to shoot the harpoon, and then gradually teaches players to use various complex weapons. The number of skills mastered by players steadily increases during this period, and it is easier to obtain a sense of phased achievement. </p>

<p>● <strong>Designer: Pay Attention to Interface Cleanliness and Logic</strong></p>
<p>Phased teaching can better prompt designers to pay special attention to the conciseness and logic of information transmission.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that if the designer has not paid attention to this principle, it is very likely that a large amount of information will appear on the same interface at the same time in the game, making the player unable to start, not knowing which panel to read first, and what is the relationship between them.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the designer understands the principle of phased teaching from beginning to end, he will split, classify, and present the complicated information on this panel to novice players step by step according to a certain event logic. In this way, the process of players getting started with a new game will be more interlocked, like reading a story.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Game types can be subdivided almost infinitely, and there are too many to enumerate. Although many novice guidance principles are generally applicable to different games, it is not difficult to find some differences when comparing them carefully. For example, action-oriented games focus on the training of skills and combos, which may be integrated into various corners that players cannot imagine; puzzle-adventure games focus on allowing players to explore spontaneously, so as to minimize obvious guidance.</p>
<p>Excellent game novice tutorials need to respect the needs of players, allow players to explore on their own in a relatively free space, and naturally integrate prompts or interactions into the scene when necessary. In this way, the novice tutorial is sublimated, no longer in its inherent form, but perfectly integrated with the game itself, even reaching the level that players can hardly realize that this is a kind of teaching. Players gradually learn specific skills during the game, step by step, significantly improving the efficiency of getting started, and can more deeply experience the sense of phased achievement.</p>

    <title>Achievement Systems and IntrinsicExtrinsic Motivation – Do Players Really Need Trophies</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230419/28584_1083864.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since Microsoft pioneered the achievement system in the early 20th century, game achievement systems have been an important part of the gaming community, but there have also been many questions. Game achievement systems were born as a tool to promote player engagement, but they have turned many players into pure “achievement hunters”. Do players really need achievement systems? From the perspective of motivation in psychology, perhaps we can get some different thoughts and inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="1-Do-players-really-need-trophies"><a href="#1-Do-players-really-need-trophies" class="headerlink" title="1. Do players really need trophies?"></a>1. Do players really need trophies?</h2><p>Two months ago, Fredrik Thylander, lead game designer at Ubisoft Massive, said this on Twitter: “Unpopular opinion: achievements&#x2F;trophies have been bad for gaming. It narrows games, it disrupts and diverts attention, it eats resources that could have made the game better.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F10e03acd-567a-44e2-a50a-e18fd1d21c76.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Fredrik Thylander’s tweet on Twitter received attention from more than 200,000 players</em></p>
<p>Thylander’s speech sparked a lot of discussion among players, with both supporters and opponents. Supporters believe that achievements make players play games only for achievements. Many players don’t even enjoy the game well. They just open the guide and get one platinum trophy or achievement point after another. Some opponents believe that the existence of the game achievement system provides them with a goal to play the game, otherwise they may never challenge those high-difficulty or racing-type gameplays.</p>
<p>The good and bad of the achievement system is certainly not a monistic point of view. At least for many game developers and platforms, the existence of the achievement system has become an inseparable part. It can effectively extend the life of the game, guide players to experience the complete game design content, and provide players with a simple and direct game goal and positive feedback. But for players, the achievement system is not an insignificant prompt that pops up at the bottom of the game interface. As an external incentive mechanism, it profoundly affects the player’s motivation for the game. More and more players are beginning to question: Do we really need achievements?</p>
<h2 id="2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect"><a href="#2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect"></a>2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect</h2><p>The birth of the achievement system can be traced back to the 1980s Activision game <em>Chopper Command</em>, whose gameplay is very common flight shooting. But what’s more special is that if the player’s game score exceeds 10,000 points, the player can take a photo or video and exchange it for a special physical game badge from Activision. However, physical achievements are still a bit cumbersome, and soon achievements began to shift to the form of “electronic certificates”. The 1990 puzzle game <em>E-Motion</em> designed 5 “achievements” in the game. Players can get game points by completing all levels, which is the prototype of today’s achievement system.</p>
<p>The first cross-game achievement system was born in 2005, when Microsoft first launched the Gamerscore system on Xbox 360. Players can earn achievement points by completing game achievements on the platform, and points from different games can be accumulated. Subsequently, in 2008, Sony changed the score to a more intuitive trophy system. One achievement corresponds to one trophy. Players can unlock the platinum trophy as long as they obtain all achievements. Compared with points, trophies can more directly represent the player’s game completion and have become one of the most representative features on the PS platform. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe1823c92-eb25-4681-8c97-78235b590e88.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Trophy levels on PS: The player’s level is determined according to the quality and number of trophies obtained by the player)</em></p>
<p>Of course, players who play console games all year round also know that Nintendo games do not have an achievement system. In this regard, then-Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto said: “I don’t like to use external factors to attract people to invest time in games. I hope players play games just because they enjoy the game.”</p>
<p>The game concepts of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo correspond to the external motivation and internal motivation of players to play games.</p>
<p><em>Extrinsic motivation</em> means that a person chooses to participate in an activity not because they like it very much, or because it can make you feel satisfied, but because this activity can bring some kind of reward or avoid some kind of punishment; <em>Intrinsic motivation</em> is directly related to the activity itself. Because doing something can stimulate people’s interest and make people happy, the activity itself is the goal pursued by the actor.</p>
<p>In recent years, many designers or players have questioned the value of the achievement system, largely because: as an external motivation provided by the manufacturer, game trophies can easily form an <em>overjustification effect</em>, reducing the player’s internal motivation.</p>
<p>The research on the overjustification effect began in the 1970s. In 1971, Edward Deci, a psychology professor at the University of Rochester, invited two groups of college students to complete intelligence tests. Experimental group subjects could get $1 reward for each problem solved, while control group subjects had no reward. Then observe whether the two groups of subjects will continue to solve problems after the test is over. The results found that although the experimental group worked very hard to solve problems, they obviously lost interest in solving problems after the test was over; while the control group would continue to solve problems after the test was over.</p>
<p>The overjustification effect represents the damage of external motivation to internal motivation. If too many external rewards are used to motivate individuals to do something they are willing to do, it will reduce their internal motivation. Because this will make this individual think that his motivation for behavior comes from the outside, and once the external motivation is lost, the individual will not continue to engage in this behavior.</p>
<p>In 2010, a speech at the Global Game Developers Conference (GDC), “Achievements Considered Harmful?”, proposed the harmful impact of the achievement system on players from this perspective. Achievements themselves exist as external incentives for the game, but with the achievement system, the game motivation of many players will gradually shift to unlocking trophies in the game. Players may gradually lose their love for the game on the way to unlocking trophies, and become pure “achievement hunters” or “platinum hunters”.</p>
<p>Platinum trophies provide a goal for many players, but they also limit many players to just getting trophies and showing them off on social media.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements"><a href="#3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements" class="headerlink" title="3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?"></a>3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?</h2><p>Since external motivation will damage the internal motivation of the game, should we completely abandon the achievement system?</p>
<p>In the study of the motivation system, Deci further tested the impact of “verbal rewards” on task motivation, and found that, compared with those without feedback, students who were told “you did a good job” showed an increase in intrinsic motivation on subsequent tasks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the overjustification effect is not inevitable. With more and more research, scholars have given clearer results on the relationship between external motivation and internal motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Non-contingent external rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can only be obtained when the activity results reach a certain level) cause less damage to intrinsic motivation and produce more promotion than those <em>contingent rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can be obtained as long as the activity is carried out);</p>
<p>  Non-contingent external rewards and contingent rewards correspond to two different types of achievements: assessment achievements and contingent achievements. <em>Assessment achievement</em> means that players will only be given specific rewards if they achieve a certain standard, such as our more common high-difficulty clearance achievements or level ratings. <em>Contingent achievement</em> is a reward that players will inevitably be given as long as they complete a certain event or process. Process rewards mostly belong to this.</p>
<p>  Because of their low acquisition difficulty, contingent achievements are difficult to form effective positive feedback on player behavior. At the same time, in recent years, the overall game difficulty has become more friendly, and necessary achievements are easily overused, which instead easily attracts players to focus on trophies rather than the game itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Unexpected rewards</em> have a greater positive effect on intrinsic motivation than <em>expected rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  This division actually involves the design problem of the achievement system itself - should we hide the achievements or completely display them to the player. Aside from achievements hidden to avoid spoilers, most game achievements are still mainly explicit. Explicit achievements provide players with a relatively clear goal and a preliminary understanding of the game. Players are also more likely to simply plan their game path through game achievements. For example, in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, in addition to the conventional high-difficulty clearance achievements, some fancy clearance achievements will also be explicitly shown to players - the creator implies that players can choose to continuously increase the difficulty level of the game, or choose to challenge some strange clearance methods.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F37f49a7f-c1ed-4df7-b857-0e455eddfe2c.png/size/"></p>
<pre><code>*(Fancy clearance achievements in the rogue-like card game &quot;Slay the Spire&quot;)*

Compared with explicit achievements, hidden achievements appear less frequently in games, but they have a better promoting effect on players&#39; internal motivation. Not letting players know the specific trophy content in advance, and giving players rewards when players accidentally trigger or curiously try some new content, can stimulate players&#39; game fun more than directly telling players the achievement content. Because this kind of unexpected feedback is based on the player&#39;s own playing motivation, it will also encourage players to make more attempts and &quot;unorthodox&quot; gameplay.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Intangible external rewards</em> produce more promotion and less weakening than <em>tangible rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  It is not appropriate to use intangible and tangible descriptions to evaluate the achievement system. After all, platinum trophies are not really “platinum”. For the achievement system, tangible&#x2F;intangible actually lies in whether the achievement system carries other external values in addition to game incentives and self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>  For example, for many players, full achievements have always had a strong social significance.</p>
<p>  From the perspective of the game platform, the achievement system generally exists as part of the community system. You can clearly see the number of platinum trophies of this player in the PS personal profile; there is also a special “achievement showcase” on Steam for players to display their achievements. Single-player games themselves naturally lack interaction between players. For the core players of the platform, they always need something to show their “noble status”. This is also why single-player games pay more attention to the achievement system than online games. After all, online games have levels, combat power, and appearance, and single-player players want to prove that they are superior, and there is almost no other way but trophies.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F9bca9588-bc41-4314-9384-e1c8e8e2cf60.jpg/size/"></p>
<pre><code>In addition, when the platinum trophy has become a matter of &quot;competitiveness&quot;, the nature of the matter will change differently.

There is a website called Astats, which will count the game achievements of the Steam platform in real time, as well as the number of achievements completed by players, and give rankings, providing an off-game PVP standard for steam achievement hunters. What kind of demand there is, there is what kind of product. There are many achievement-hunting games on Steam, represented by *Achievement Hunter*. Players basically only need to do nothing and hang up for two hours to unlock more than a thousand achievements in the game. These &quot;games&quot; themselves only serve the external value of achievements, and players no longer have any internal motivation for the game itself.

&amp;nbsp;

<pre><code>*(Achievement ranking on the Astats website, the highest-ranked player has completed 1.64 million achievements)*
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Returning to our opening question, do players really need achievements? We might as well use a sentence from Hegel to answer this question:</p>
<p>“What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.”</p>
<p>The gamerscore system, introduced in 2005, was intended to help boost activity among players and to get them to talk to each other more about the games.  Two years later, Xbox 360 product manager Aaron Greenberg said, “And we found out that a lot of people were playing Xbox games a lot because we offered points and the other platforms didn’t.”</p>
<p>At least for most players now, the achievement system is still an inseparable part of the game itself. At the end of last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em> landed on Steam, and many negative reviews came from the fact that the game did not have an achievement system.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a big deal to have no achievements. Nintendo has always maintained an indifferent attitude towards achievements. They can add 999 “Korok Seeds” in Zelda. Whether players choose to collect them and how much they collect depends entirely on personal wishes. Therefore, for players, how to design achievements is far more important than whether there are achievements.</p>
<p>As an external motivation to motivate players, the achievement system itself has the risk of overjustification effect. However, adding moderate assessment achievements and hidden achievements to the game can not only avoid the overjustification effect, but also further stimulate the player’s internal motivation. Although it is difficult for us to avoid the existence of achievement PVP, most platforms now provide options to hide achievements or trophies. When we want to truly experience the game, we may also choose to turn on the options.</p>

    <title>How to Apply Gestalt Principles in Game Interface Design</title>

<h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2><p>Although the user interface in video games is not the most shining part of the game, it carries the important function of conveying information to the player. In the process of industry development, the game content has become more and more rich, carrying more functions, and the elements on the interface are inevitably increasing. And how to organize their arrangement to clearly and intuitively convey information to players has gradually become an important proposition.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, three German psychologists established the Gestalt Principle based on the study of apparent motion. They applied the Gestalt Principle to aesthetics in a specific way, combined it with various psychological processes, and promoted aesthetic research with Gestalt tendencies.</p>
<p>And now, this principle can also well guide the design of game interfaces. This article will explain the eight principles of “Gestalt Principle” and their application in the game field one by one, to see how this nearly century-old law has insight into people’s perception of interface elements and applied it to game interface design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F07f61e91-6298-45cd-a9e5-0a15ddefdda3.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-GESTALT-Gestalt-Principles"><a href="#2-GESTALT-Gestalt-Principles" class="headerlink" title="2. GESTALT: Gestalt Principles"></a>2. GESTALT: Gestalt Principles</h2><p>“The whole is something else than the sum of its parts.”——Kurt Koffka</p>
<p>First, we need to understand what the Gestalt Principles are.</p>
<p>The Gestalt Principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when perceiving shapes. It was founded by German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka in the 1930s. Its name “GESTALT” is a German word, translated as “shape”. It is the principle&#x2F;law of human perception. Gestalt psychologists emphasize that people perceive the overall form of graphics, not just individual elements. Therefore, if you want to summarize it in one sentence, it is Kurt Koffka’s “The whole is something else than the sum of its parts.” Interestingly, this famous saying is often mistranslated as Aristotle’s “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” which made Koffka himself laugh and cry.</p>
<p>In the long process of development and supplementation, the Gestalt Principles have also developed into a total of eight detailed principles, which describe the phenomenon of humans simplifying complex images when perceiving shapes in different situations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fcb22797e-2ec0-49a5-8fc9-39d341e581cc.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Similarity"><a href="#Similarity" class="headerlink" title="Similarity"></a>Similarity</h3><p>The definition of the principle of similarity is: when elements have the same visual characteristics, people think that these elements have a certain connection. These visual characteristics can include color, shape, size, font, texture, and so on.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that color is a particularly strong visual feature, and its effect on visual perception can often overwhelm other visual features and change the user’s perception of the whole. For example, in the figure below, observers tend to identify the following graphics as three rows or four columns based on the similarity of shapes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F7c1e18ca-bedf-4d56-9f1f-142259d3cbff.png/size/"></p>
<p>However, if colors are added to the elements irregularly on the basis of the original image, observers will naturally think that the blue elements are a group and the white elements are a group. It can be seen that color has a dominant power in perception. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fea1b38d2-58f7-4221-84f8-311b3e52a6a0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, cleverly using the similarity of visual elements in the game can greatly help players understand the functions of game elements and the connections between them without the need for extra teaching.</p>
<p>In the action music game <em>HiFi RUSH</em>, the protagonist Chai’s team will gradually welcome new partners during the adventure: the blue-clothed girl Peppermint, the green strong man Macaron, and the red-haired girl Korsica. All three have their own unique abilities to assist Chai in battle in the game and exploration outside the game. For example, the green strongman Macaron can break the green shield, and the red-haired girl Korsica can blow out the flames ejected by red enemies, and also overclock the red generator to assist exploration. Through the correspondence of colors, the correspondence between the partner color - monster color - exploration mechanism color in the game is clear at a glance, clearly and intuitively reducing the player’s cognitive load. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In “HiFi RUSH”, if there is no Macaron, Chai will not be able to cause damage to green enemies</em></p>

<h3 id="Proximity"><a href="#Proximity" class="headerlink" title="Proximity"></a>Proximity</h3><p>The definition of the proximity principle is: we tend to think of elements that are close together as a group or the same object, and other separated elements as another group or object. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F435ca855-d7e0-44d7-86d0-7f3181730585.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the figure above, the three stripes of the revised Logo on the left are far apart from each other, and cannot be considered as the same whole; but if the three stripes are placed very close, they obviously form a whole, forming a classic graphic with strong recognition.</p>
<p><em>Battlefield 1</em> is set in the battlefield of World War I. It is an FPS game that focuses on large-scale tactical competition. The battlefield can accommodate large-scale firefights of up to 32VS32. In the scoreboard page of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the design of the proximity principle is well adhered to, so that the information of up to 64 people can be clearly presented, grouped, and perceived on the same page.</p>
<p>In the scoreboard interface of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the designer first uses the vertical line + white space in the middle to divide the players into two major parts according to their camp.</p>
<p>For the data arrangement within each camp, in the horizontal direction, the data is divided into two major sections by proximity: off-game information and in-game information. Off-game information includes player level, player ID, etc., which are closely arranged on the left; in-game information includes captain star, troop type, KD data, score data, player delay, etc., which are closely or sparsely arranged on the right according to their relevance. In the vertical direction, the information of each player is closely arranged together, so that players can browse a certain piece of data at a glance, and convey the visual metaphor of close unity. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that since different resolutions will squeeze the white space between components to different degrees, designers need to carefully design them for application in different adaptation resolutions to maintain the correct relative proximity relationship between components under various resolutions.</p>
<h3 id="Closure"><a href="#Closure" class="headerlink" title="Closure"></a>Closure</h3><p>The definition of the closure principle is: when people observe familiar visual images, they will perceive incomplete local images as a whole image. This perceptual ending is called closure.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic IBM logo in the figure below, we always perceive it as three letters at the first time, rather than several horizontally arranged rectangles and trapezoids. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F2899285f-c816-4dac-93da-a7d991a8407e.png/size/"></p>
<p>And the following two pictures are not black pentagons and cones scattered everywhere, but a football and a spiked ball that naturally appear in your mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ff799effa-1ea3-4c2c-a6f1-6ce157cf2434.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F28df6e4b-400b-4e32-bacb-a9b6e5c89a2a.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>In video games, the principle of closure is also widely used in icon design, animation design, and other fields, subtly influencing users’ cognition behind the user interface:</p>
<p>Friends who have played <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> will not be unfamiliar with the following icon. It is the icon located in the lower right corner of the game loading interface, which means “loading”. The design of the icon fully utilizes the principle of closure. Although the dragon scales moving in the upper left and lower right corners are not connected into a circle, it is easy for players to imagine a majestic dragon circling around the rising sun. The giant dragon with only part of its body exposed also adds a touch of mystery, which secretly matches the psychological feeling of “Wo Long” (Crouching Dragon) hidden in the dark and蓄势待发 (poised for action). </p>

<h3 id="Connectedness"><a href="#Connectedness" class="headerlink" title="Connectedness"></a>Connectedness</h3><p>The definition of the connectedness principle is: when elements are connected to each other, they are perceived as part of the same unit.</p>
<p>The connectedness principle is relatively strong, and even overwhelms the proximity principle in the example in the figure below: According to the proximity principle, we will regard 23, 45, and 67 as a whole. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F4071d431-7bda-449f-9e91-7968beda16b1.png/size/"></p>
<p>But just by connecting a few magical lines in it, we will naturally regard 12, 34, 56, and 78 as a whol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fcbb9dc08-1905-4c10-b808-4558dedac132.png/size/"></p>
<p>Such characteristics are often used on the tabs of the game menu bar. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is an open-world game set in medieval Europe. In the menu bar of this game, the tabs will be displayed in a darker gray color when they are not selected, and are separated from the main content list; the selected tabs will maintain the same color as the content list, and bridge the dividing line between the two, displaying as a complete parchment, so that players can clearly perceive that the current menu is the “food” menu. In order to fit the background era, the border and list of the game interface use stone brick material and parchment texture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ff470a5bd-8669-4b16-858d-81814c61b4a0.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Common-Fate"><a href="#Common-Fate" class="headerlink" title="Common Fate"></a>Common Fate</h3><p>The definition of the principle of common fate is: elements that move in the same direction and at the same rate are more easily identified as a whole.</p>
<p>The principle of common fate is the only one of the eight principles that involves movement and animation. Because of this, its influence on graphic recognition is extraordinary. For example, when cards slide, each card maintains the same direction and speed of movement, and the drop-down menu options expand vertically at the same rate, which are common designs on mobile Internet applications. By keeping the movement synchronized, designers can help users understand the relationship of grouped elements, thereby reducing the user’s cognitive burden. Similarly, when designers need to distinguish two elements, they only need to distinguish their movements to produce a great effect.</p>
<p><em>Devil May Cry V</em> is a masterpiece of ACT games, and its scoring system is a representative part of the series. In the chapter scoring animation of Devil May Cry, the first three scoring sub-items slide out to the right at the same rate. Without other information, players can perceive the parallel relationship between the three items in a whole; while the last item, the total score, although in the same direction, slides at a relatively slow rate, effectively distinguishing it from the scoring sub-items, and arousing the player’s expectations with a longer pre-appearance, further enhancing the positive feedback after knowing the score. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fc70b5a0d-55d7-441f-8558-043f3d209f09.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Continuity"><a href="#Continuity" class="headerlink" title="Continuity"></a>Continuity</h3><p>The principle of continuity states that elements arranged on continuous smooth lines are more relevant than elements on straight lines or curves.</p>
<p>The principle of continuity mainly refers to the influence of whether the curvature change of the line is sharp on the overall perception. In the figure below, the observer’s line of sight is likely to follow two routes: a smooth curve from top left to bottom right, or a horizontal straight line from left to right. In other words: as long as the curvature changes of the intersecting lines are significantly sharp enough, the possibility of confusing the two lines will be reduced. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fdbba0862-1162-4767-9258-c72e5cf69f17.png/size/"></p>
<p>The 2016 Independent Games Festival award-winning work <em>Mini Metro</em> is a puzzle strategy game where players need to build an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly developing city over time. Even though the game has removed most of the redundant elements on the interface, there are still a considerable number of subway lines crossing each other in the later stages of the game. However, <em>Mini Metro</em> goes against the principle of continuity, designing the shapes of subway lines to be angular, and using bold colors to distinguish them, so that players will hardly spend effort in distinguishing between two lines, while keeping the arrangement of game elements elegant and clear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fa08357c4-fcaf-49fa-8bf2-e2a6c839edbb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Figure-Ground"><a href="#Figure-Ground" class="headerlink" title="Figure&#x2F;Ground"></a>Figure&#x2F;Ground</h3><p>The Figure&#x2F;Ground principle states that people instinctively decompose graphics, photos, logos, websites, movie screens, and other actual life scenes into “figure” and “ground”, thereby simplifying the image, saving time, and reducing cognitive burden. The most famous and intuitive example is an interesting optical illusion art, the Rubin vase designed by Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin in 1915: whether the subject of the picture is a vase or a face depends on whether you see the graphic as white or black. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe68e6147-f694-46fc-8d04-9be780d500bd.png/size/"></p>
<p>For designers, the most important thing is to clearly distinguish between the figure and the ground in order to guide attention to the key elements of the interface, provide visual cues, and prevent any confusion for the user, thereby keeping the user’s attention on the key information.</p>
<p>In <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em>, players will reach the Banner of Chivalry point for rest after a battle. At this time, the game is paused, and external dangers will not affect the protagonist. <em>Wo Long</em> then performs grayscale and semi-transparent processing on the game screen of the big world at this time, turning it into the “background” in the visual relationship. At this time, the player’s attention is also attracted to the more critical camp rest operation that has become the “figure”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F542192cd-5d13-4f08-b0b5-6cf3a5ed46d7.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="Common-Region"><a href="#Common-Region" class="headerlink" title="Common Region"></a>Common Region</h3><p>The Common Region principle states: elements within a boundary are perceived as a group and are assumed to have a common feature or function.</p>
<p>The Common Region principle usually overrides weaker principles, such as the proximity principle or the similarity principle. Therefore, when designers deal with a variety of UI elements or have no space to adjust the white space, the Common Region principle will become a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>For example, in the table below, due to the proximity principle, the table below may be misinterpreted as classifying information by category, arranging it in columns, and dividing the three types of information of “University”, “Country”, and “Time Zone” into three groups. At this time, the proximity principle may interfere with your judgment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F8e5c1cf8-25b2-4d56-aa6d-17907d6f1464.png/size/"></p>
<p>But when the designer adds spaced zebra stripes to them, the overall relationship is very clear: each group of “University”, “Country”, and “Time Zone” information is arranged in a row relationship, expressing the country and time zone where each university is located. Even if the row spacing is much smaller than the column spacing, the observer will not misinterpret it as arranged in columns. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F20691448-983e-463d-b926-418b60cead56.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After adding zebra stripes, can you recognize which information is a group faster?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In video games, which have a richer form of information transmission, the Common Region principle has more multi-dimensional means. The game map of <em>The Division</em> is divided into multiple areas. When the area is irregular and there is no space for white space, the designer uses the flickering effect of the area filling and the red borders that separate each other to clearly and directly depict the current area and the dividing line between different areas, and also integrates the uneven buildings in the map into abstract areas named by humans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fd0be2700-ca73-4582-968b-c4bec86b0cdc.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>The Division</em></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>The Gestalt Principle is already a “centenarian”. Since its introduction, it has been widely used in graphic design, product design, website design, and other fields. As a general design principle and guideline, it helps designers create more attractive, easy-to-understand, and organized designs. The idea of “the whole is not the sum of its parts” contained in it has not become outdated due to the changes of the times. Instead, it has stood firm in the long river of time and has endured for a long time.</p>
<p>As a new art form, games have added the dimension of interaction in addition to vision and hearing. The new characteristics and new problems in them are very worthy of scrutiny. The laws and principles that have been verified by the long river of time are the handy weapons for designers to overcome obstacles in the new era. </p>

    <title>How Do Socially-Inclined Korean Gamers Influence Game Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/04/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20230419_28584_1083880/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230419/28584_1083880.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game White Paper” released in January 2023 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Content Agency, in 2021, the global market share of Korean games reached 7.6%, second only to the United States, China, and Japan. It is the fourth largest game market in the world, with an annual consumption of 20.9913 trillion won (about 109.6 billion yuan). This figure is expected to reach 22.7 trillion won in 2022.</p>
<p>As a mainstream region for games to go overseas, many domestic companies are targeting the huge potential market of South Korea and launching localized game versions. In the localization process, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the characteristics of local players and make corresponding adjustments. Socially, players like in-game social interaction and also value communication in the game community. An in-depth understanding of the characteristics and needs of Korean game players can provide more targeted help for game localization.</p>
<h2 id="1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games"><a href="#1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games"></a>1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games</h2><p>Many players like to socialize in games, and Korean games also take advantage of this, encouraging players to cooperate or compete with other players. They generally provide a variety of social functions in the game, such as chat rooms, teams, and guilds, and support players to share game experiences in the game community to meet players’ social needs. This not only enriches the game content, but also promotes communication between players, and is an important means to improve player stickiness and loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Methods"><a href="#Social-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Social Methods"></a>Social Methods</h3><p>Many players regard games as a way of socializing, maintaining friendships and making new friends through games, expanding their social circle.</p>
<p>For many Korean players, games can be a way of socializing. Newzoo’s 2022 Korean player report shows that the biggest reason Korean players play games is for social interaction (18%). Playing games with friends can both kill time and enhance relationships. Therefore, most Korean games also incorporate social elements. For example, some games integrate the communication function of the social chat software Kakao, which can contact and add Kakao friends, and provide exclusive emoticon stickers for Kakao users, which is a relatively effective social marketing strategy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F4e5d19c9-8faf-4e80-b0b5-72992d64de48.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game Player Status Survey Report” (hereinafter referred to as the player survey), among PC game players, in addition to “relieving stress” and “killing time”, 30.2% of players choose “playing games with friends and family”. This ratio is higher among young players, and also shows that players in their 10s to 30s pay more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F805c7d37-fea7-4343-bf56-a1cbed438fbb.png/size/"></p>
<p>However, this ratio is only 13.4% among mobile game players. However, in addition to the convenience of mobile phones and the fun of the game itself, the second most important element for mobile game players is social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F1eab54c8-7e90-41aa-8e90-0b1494355dad.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, for mobile game players, 28.5% of players will use direct recommendations from friends as a reference for downloading new games, which is as important as the app store (Google Play, App Store, One Store) ranking reference. It can be seen that friends’ recommendations are an important factor that cannot be ignored. Playing the social element card well is also conducive to the game gaining more new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ffda97707-70b0-44f8-a29c-c5bd5ac2acf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Korean PC bangs (internet cafes) are also an important part of their game industry, and the social nature of Korean PC bang players is particularly significant. According to a player survey, 57.3% of people who go to PC bangs to play games do so to play games with friends&#x2F;colleagues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe784115b-d3e0-4ae0-b7cc-329fe07cb6a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, in the post-epidemic era, the trend of game social interaction has been reflected in players around the world. A study by Ipsos in conjunction with “Google for Games”, &lt;2022 The Shifting Needs of Global Mobile Gamers&gt;, shows that many players build connections with others through mobile games. Although people have gradually resumed offline social activities after the epidemic, online social habits have remained, and more and more players tend to communicate with others in games, replacing some offline social interactions. Sometimes, friends in the game even feel closer than acquaintances in life. Especially for Korean players, the game motivation of “having a common topic with others”, which is related to social purposes, has become stronger in the past year. It can be seen that players are paying more and more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb645e70f-cf63-4f54-8071-497c9abb328a.png/size/"></p>
<p>In Newzoo’s research on game driving forces, it was found that the reasons for Chinese players’ gaming behavior are also relatively obvious. Games involving competition, exploration, and strategy are more directly attractive to players, while social purposes are lower than these factors. Another Newzoo survey of Japanese players shows that the three main motivations for Japanese players to play games are “relaxation and stress relief” (50%), “filling free time” (49%), and “exploring the game storyline” (45%). Only 13% of players play for social reasons (global average 25%), and only 11% play for the sense of competition and the joy of victory. It can be seen that emphasis on competitiveness and social interaction is more obvious in Korean players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb3a07c89-fb25-47cc-9a12-a8967d24ffe4.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fbad82401-206a-465f-af06-0f5565257bd2.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Game-Communities"><a href="#Game-Communities" class="headerlink" title="Game Communities"></a>Game Communities</h3><p>Secondly, the development of game communities has also become a favorable booster for player communication, including game forums, offline activities, and other forms. Korean game communities have developed rapidly, providing players with game-related information, functional, and interactive services. In South Korea, the local game unofficial communities with a relatively large number of users include DCinside, inven, and ruliweb. In the April popular community ranking, two pure game communities (inven, ruliweb) occupied the top five. The top-ranked comprehensive community, DCinside, also has a dedicated game section. These communities provide players with a more free discussion space, where they can find game content that players are more concerned about, and problems encountered by players, which helps to follow up on player feedback and public opinion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F06dbfe41-b734-4305-ba3f-3bfa0e687513.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, as a high-quality martial arts battle royale game, requires team cooperation and communication. <em>Naraka</em>’s Korean players have spontaneously established game groups on Discord, DC, and Kakao, sharing game-related information, sharing operations, displaying drawn skins and character customization data, discussing update information, helping other players solve various problems encountered during the game, and also looking for teammates to form teams, and even participating in competitions together. These forums or communities provide a platform for players to communicate, discuss the latest event plans, observe the operations of experts, find teammates to play together, and extend the feelings in the game to outside the game. A good community atmosphere is also conducive to attracting players and improving player retention.</p>
<p>At the same time, the community is also a window for game developers to communicate with players. Games that listen carefully to player feedback in forums, respect player opinions, and make timely improvements can also gain player recognition. For example, Smilegate’s MMORPG <em>LOST ARK</em> received many negative reviews on image quality, automatic combat, balance, etc. when it was first launched, but the development team promised players that it would make improvements, and after the update, it solved more than 90% of the problems and removed the content that players did not like. After the Season 2 update, the game’s daily visits increased by 122%, new players increased by 542%, and returning players increased by 213%. The development team even received support advertisements from players. Players highly praised Smilegate’s effective communication and active community operation.</p>
<h3 id="Esports-Culture"><a href="#Esports-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Esports Culture"></a>Esports Culture</h3><p>Third, the booming esports culture in South Korea is also an important part of its game social interaction. Many players pay attention to esports events and enjoy the social experience brought by the game by participating, watching, and commenting on esports events.</p>
<p>South Korea has played a significant role in promoting the development of esports. In 1998, <em>StarCraft</em> changed the landscape of the Korean game industry. Under the influence of the Asian financial crisis, the esports industry attracted the attention of capital and ushered in huge development. The concept of professional players was born. After the financial crisis, the Korean esports industry also received government support. Now, Korean esports has formed a relatively mature industrial model and is also an important part of Korean game culture. Esports competitions are very popular in South Korea and have a large audience. Korean players’ love and attention to esports are also very high. Esports activities are both competition events and social activities. Players watch esports live broadcasts, comment and communicate, reflecting Korean players’ enthusiasm for game competition. </p>

<h2 id="2-Localization-Suggestions"><a href="#2-Localization-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Suggestions"></a>2. Localization Suggestions</h2><p>It can be seen that the Korean game market has huge potential and is also one of the important landing points for games to go overseas. Therefore, when launching games overseas, it is also necessary to fully understand the characteristics and preferences of local players, and deeply customize them during research and development, localization, and continuous operation, so that they can be welcomed by more players in the local market.</p>
<h3 id="Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game"><a href="#Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Community Operation Outside the Game"></a>Community Operation Outside the Game</h3><p>First, it is necessary to pay attention to community operation, focus on community building and interaction, and encourage players to share game experiences and insights.</p>
<p>Korean game communities have diverse forms and rich content, and different types of communities have a wide range of influence among Korean game players. Players share game guides and exchange game experiences in game forums, which can not only improve their game skills, but also promote interaction and social interaction between game players. By holding various activities such as competitions and lucky draws, mobilizing players’ enthusiasm can not only enhance players’ feelings, but also deepen the connection between players and the game.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Social-Gameplay"><a href="#In-Game-Social-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Social Gameplay"></a>In-Game Social Gameplay</h3><p>Secondly, the gameplay should also consider the social needs and habits of Korean players. <em>StarCraft</em> set off a wave of Korean game competition in the last century, driving the development of PC bangs and allowing players to experience the joy of competition in the game. Nowadays, the RTS, FPS, and MMORPG games that Korean players love also pay attention to the social needs of players. Strengthening players’ sense of belonging to guilds and teams, developing interesting multiplayer gameplay and team gameplay, convenient chat and friend systems, friend trading, reasonable ranking and achievement systems, etc., will give players a better experience.</p>
<p>In-depth research on Korean players before release and during continuous operation will help accurately capture the differences in social needs of different player groups and help the game better establish a player social network in South Korea. In the game, communicating, exploring, and cooperating with partners to complete difficult tasks and win over other opponents, so that high-quality games can build a bridge for players’ friendship, may also be an important meaning of the game itself.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players in various countries have user characteristics that cannot be ignored. To do a good job in localization, it is also necessary to have a deeper understanding of players, grasp player needs, and provide corresponding services according to the game in order to better retain players and achieve common growth. Games are an important part of Korean players’ social lives. Players value in-game social interaction, friend communication, actively participate in game communities, and enjoy the fun of esports. In the process of localization, you can start from two aspects: in-game social interaction and out-of-game social marketing. Develop convenient friend and guild systems in the game, actively maintain the community outside the game, improve player stickiness, consider players’ social needs, and formulate strategies that are consistent with the characteristics of the game itself while taking into account players’ social habits.</p>
<p>Of course, the most core competitiveness is undoubtedly relying on high-quality content, including the core of key gameplay and the appearance of exquisite art. On this basis, targeted adjustments made for local players can be the icing on the cake.</p>

    <title>Naraka Bladepoint Japanese Community Research - Focusing on 5chan</title>
    <url>/2023/04/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20230419_28584_1083882/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230419/28584_1083882.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the spread and rise of video games in modern society, the term “game community” related to video games has gradually entered the public eye. In today’s increasingly globalized world, the overseas expansion of games has become an indispensable part of the development of the game industry. Therefore, investigating the “game communities” of players in target regions, and subsequently formulating appropriate strategies for game distribution and subsequent operations, has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>The “game community” is a subset of the concept of “virtual community”. “Virtual community” was first proposed by Howard Rheingold, meaning “a group of people who primarily communicate with each other through computer networks, who have a certain degree of shared cognition, share knowledge and information, and care for each other to a large extent as friends, thus forming a group”. Unlike the traditional concept of community, “virtual community” originates from computers, is built in the virtual world, and develops on the Internet. The “game community” derived from the concept of “virtual community” refers to a group that spontaneously gathers on the Internet around the common interest of games.</p>
<p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> Japanese community in this article is a group of Japanese players who have spontaneously gathered around the game. Due to the diversity of network platforms, game communities also have various forms of expression. In Japan, mainstream game communities include Twitter, 5channel (also known as 2channel, hereinafter referred to as 5ch), Lobi, and so on. Because each platform has its own characteristics and functions, the game communities formed by players will also show different characteristics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb1caa3e1-54a1-4d0a-baa9-a51a0a85930d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan"><a href="#1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="1. User Characteristics of 5chan"></a>1. User Characteristics of 5chan</h2><p>When accessing the Japanese Internet, especially cultural and community activities, 5chan and its user base are impossible to ignore. 5chan, formerly known as “2channel” (2ch.net, hereinafter referred to as 2ch), was founded by Hiroyuki Nishimura in 1999 and is Japan’s largest anonymous forum (now no longer completely anonymous). Its initial purpose was to serve as an alternative website to “Amezou Bulletin Board”. Amezou Bulletin Board was a comprehensive forum that aggregated multiple posts, and adopted the then-epoch-making “thread float type bulletin board” format (posts that received replies would be pushed to the top of the thread, while posts that did not receive replies would sink relatively, and posts with no response at all would sink to the bottom).</p>
<p>Later, Amezou Bulletin Board was closed in 2000 due to lack of functionality, server instability, and other reasons, and a large number of users poured into 2ch. In 2014, the actual management authority of 2ch (2ch.net) was transferred to James Arthur Watkins, Hiroyuki Nishimura was dismissed, and “2channel” (2ch.sc) was established. In 2017, “2channel” owned by James Arthur Watkins was renamed “5channel” (5ch.net).</p>
<p>5chan, which was opened in 1999, absorbed the habits of previous forums in terms of users, content, and forum terminology. The communication method of avoiding collusion among users and using unique jargon (later called 2ch terminology) was strongly influenced by electronic forums in the dawn of the Internet, namely the “dark web”.</p>
<p>In addition to the particularity of communication, 5chan also contains many opinions and information that cannot be seen in newspapers, television, or well-known media, and shows a critical attitude towards specific media such as <em>Asahi Shimbun</em>. Many people believe that “if I have to say, there is more negative information on 2ch. Because it is a vent for the negative personality of human beings, it is reasonable to degenerate into a garbage dump”.</p>
<p>In Tomohisa Hirai’s “Investigation of 2ch Communication: Discussion on the Internet and its Public Opinion Formation”, he summarizes the users of 2ch into the following 3 characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints"><a href="#Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints"></a>Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints</h3><p>Compared with face-to-face communication, Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) gives communicators (the actors themselves) more room for deliberation and choice. In face-to-face communication, communicators can express themselves through speech, body movements, clothing, etc., but it is difficult to manipulate self-expression related to physical characteristics such as gender, race, and age. In most cases, communicators themselves will also suppress self-expression behaviors that deviate from the unified values or behavioral norms of society. Communicators in CMC will be in a situation that is more free relative to norms. In addition, the “anonymity” and “ease of participation and withdrawal” that form and maintain the communication environment in which communicators are located also have a certain impact in CMC.</p>
<p>Personal communication on the Internet is a liberation from social constraints, and 2ch provides an environment of “anonymity” and “availability to join and leave at any time”. Because 2ch guarantees that users can be liberated from social restrictions, users can carry out communication that is rarely expressed in daily life. Some players may indeed feel dissatisfied with certain aspects of a game, but it is not appropriate to complain about it in the game’s social network or discuss its negative factors in depth. Some players will express their opinions on anonymous platforms with relatively few restrictions, thereby achieving self-expression.</p>
<h3 id="Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model"><a href="#Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model" class="headerlink" title="Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model"></a>Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model</h3><p>Research related to the SIDE model is based on the hypothesis that “the lack of personal cues will make participants have a higher sense of group in their personal identity and mutual behavior, and increase their trust in the group and related rules”, with the purpose of investigating “anonymous CMC situations”. The method is to observe the group set in the laboratory. The observation results can be summarized as “in the case of anonymous communication with clear group characteristics, participants are often forced to be depersonalized. The result is that personal consciousness is lower than the consciousness as a group member. From the perspective of enhancing group member consciousness, two views can be derived: ① If the “group member” consciousness is higher than the “personal consciousness”, participants tend to obey situational norms. ② When participants are aware of their group identity, they tend to favor the internal group, discriminate against the external group, and have higher hostility towards the external group. And these characteristics can be found in 2ch.</p>
<h3 id="Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s"><a href="#Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s" class="headerlink" title="Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s"></a>Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s</h3><p>In the communication of young people after the 1990s, one effective view is “valuing relationship”. In other words, compared to conveying content, communicators pay more attention to the communication itself with others, that is, “communication for the sake of communication”. In the view of sociology, young people after 1995 have little resonance with the value system of mass media, but value the relationship with friends who are close to them. Similarly, although young people are more sensitive to the nature of their relationships with friends, they often enjoy this relationship. Young people are more concerned about intimate relationships, but more indifferent to the outside of intimate relationships.</p>
<p>In summary, the overall user profile of 5chan can be summarized as: young people who gather together due to the same interest, have a desire for self-expression, value internal relationships, have exclusionary psychology towards external groups, have stronger cohesion within the forum, and are more active in communication.</p>
<h2 id="2-Functional-Features-of-5chan"><a href="#2-Functional-Features-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="2. Functional Features of 5chan"></a>2. Functional Features of 5chan</h2><p>When studying the potential game community of 2ch, it is necessary to not only focus on the user characteristics of the entire 2ch forum, but also combine the functional characteristics of the 2ch forum itself.</p>
<p>Currently, 5chan has 39 main boards, and the main boards are further divided into sub-boards. Among them, there are three main boards related to games, namely games, mobile games, and online games. Under the main board, the platform will make a more detailed classification of games according to the type of game. The game board covers a wider range of games and contains more sub-boards. Users can click on the corresponding sub-board to enter the section after judging according to the type of game they want to browse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F87629d4e-2e96-4bfd-b5ca-a63b951486fc.png/size/"></p>
<p>After entering a sub-board, you can first see the content and theme discussed in the board. In order to prevent users from going to the wrong board and posting in the wrong place, links to connected or easily confused boards will be marked.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> belongs to the PC Action (PC action game) section, and the content discussed is all FPS, TPS, and action games running on Windows and other computers. Please go to other sections for other types of games, such as adult-oriented Galgames, online games, etc. Like Baidu Tieba, the board rules and posting rules are located at the top for new users to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do not reply to any troublemaking, inciting, prohibited topics, hit-and-run, or useless posts &gt;(repliers are also regarded as troublemakers)]</p>
<p>[Please confirm before posting]</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a public place. Please do not create useless posts unrelated to PC action games.</li>
<li>Please confirm that you have not posted in the wrong section.</li>
<li>Please search the [Post Overview] again to confirm that no one has posted duplicate or similar posts.</li>
<li>Series works should be posted in a unified post. Niche games should be based on the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crimes, illegal copying, software exchange, emulators, pornography, yellow jokes, attacks on fixed nicknames and individual players, and repeaters are prohibited. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F441c6f4c-26c0-4a26-a4f6-e275de8d9003.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F3ec9c3a9-5a9e-43df-a650-caedb3716dd5.png/size/"></p>
<p>This ensures that users who enter a certain post are first of all interested in the field where the post is located or have already understood it, and can communicate with people who have the same interest, and the speeches in the communication process follow the same forum rules and themes. Secondly, due to the secrecy of the retrieval system and the anonymity of users, 5chan is distinguished from some popular social media such as Twitter and completely open communication communities such as Discord.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the characteristics of the forum, the content of users’ speeches on 5chan will also be different from other communities. As mentioned above, the exclusionary psychology of 5chan users is reflected in the rules of the forum. They often prohibit new players from directly posting duplicate content without reading previous posts, or posting some content that is not worth posting separately. We believe that the rules that new users first read after entering 5chan will give them a feeling of entering an internal group from the public world, which will make them naturally abide by the rules of the internal group, otherwise they will be expelled by the internal group. The process of browsing the post history is not only a process of learning the rules of the internal group, but also a process of gradually recognizing their identity as an internal member.</p>
<p>In addition to the characteristics of user speeches, when searching for information on social media such as Twitter, it is usually a direct search or following some related tweeters. This will make users browse more than communicate even if they are interested in a certain field on social media. Even if they tweet to ask some content, they may not be answered. The unique Japanese habit of “FF-gai kara shitsurei shimasu” (I’m sorry to comment without following you or being followed by you) will also make the communication lengthy and complicated, and whether or not to follow will get a lot of redundant information that they don’t want. However, in a separate post of a certain game on 5chan, the desire for communication among members who belong to this internal group is greater than their desire for browsing, and the various conveniences of the forum also ensure that members can speak and discuss freely under the constraints of regulations. Therefore, the communication of users on the forum is more prosperous, and the feedback on the game will be directly posted on the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fed92bc22-2dd7-4ba1-9bc0-cecb8657c3df.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan"><a href="#3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan" class="headerlink" title="3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan"></a>3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan</h2><p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> thread in 5chan was created on November 12, 2020 during the game’s internal test, which triggered players’ discussions about the initial hero strength. Since the game had not yet been released, the thread also became inactive. In April 2021, the game was tested again, and because it was possible to directly experience the game, the discussion about the game in the thread was also more active. Players’ discussions during the game test can directly reflect the players’ real views on the game, guiding the development team to further improve the content of the game.</p>
<p>After the game was officially released, the discussion of the game was directly focused on the essence of the game - gameplay. In Japan, the solo mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is classified as a fighting game, and the release method of the character’s ultimate, the strength of the character, and the combos of various weapons have been discussed. For the parts other than the gameplay itself, the battle pass, and the face customization function, which is one of the hot spots of the game, can only be said to be rarely discussed. In addition to the discussion focused on the gameplay itself and the exchange and discussion of game techniques, unlike other communities, this is not a platform for making friends, so there is no pure personal showing off and unprovoked insults to other players, and due to the high degree of participation and cohesion, the questions raised by players can also be answered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F7823b4fb-e281-4c22-a4fa-b206b802edf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Compared with other social media, such as Twitter and Weibo, the visible range of content posted is filtered, requiring keyword searches or following someone, and the lack of anonymity and other functions also leads to users being unlikely to get interaction. Even if they can participate in the discussion in real time, it is difficult to form a discussion atmosphere where many people express their opinions on the same issue. In addition, due to visibility, word count limits, and disagreement with others, negative impressions posted on open large-scale social media may also cause disgust and lead to disputes. In contrast, 5chan first filters the participants in the discussion - players who have a certain understanding of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Secondly, the anonymity, functions, and its own cohesive characteristics of the forum make the discussion here more active and real, showing the players’ gaming experience, rather than meaningless complaints, spam, or recruitment information.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When understanding overseas game trends through research and capture of game communities, and then feeding back to game development, it is first necessary to understand the composition and characteristics of overseas communities in the target country. On the basis of further understanding user needs, apply them to the improvement of the game. The communities of each country will show different characteristics in their own culture and the evolution of Internet history, which is also a part worth paying attention to. How to use the characteristics reflected in the communities of each country to promote the game is also a topic that needs to be considered when expanding influence through communities.</p>

    <title>Why Do Players Turn a Blind Eye? Novice Guide Design from the Perspective of Selective Attention</title>
    <url>/2023/03/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20230424_28584_1084761/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230424/28584_1084761.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In game research, we found a common phenomenon: when players experience new games or new gameplays, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play; on the other hand, the developers feel very confused. There is obviously a long introduction to the gameplay in the game, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Some veteran players also feel that new players are particularly “blind and unskilled” when they team up with new players to play dungeons. Even if the information is obvious, the novice will say that they did not see it.</p>
<p>So, how does this “blindness” of players come about? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”"><a href="#1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”" class="headerlink" title="1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?"></a>1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?</h2><p>When players are doing novice training, they need to go through the following steps to finally master the gameplay: I see the guide, I know I need to do this, I do it, I learn it. And if any of these steps are missing, it will cause the player to fail to learn.</p>
<p>In the initial research expectation, we believed that players getting stuck in the novice stage might be more difficult in “completing the guide”, that is, the task settings need to be adjusted. However, subsequent eye-tracking tests showed that more players were stuck in the first two steps, that is, the players did not see the guide at all, and this was not because the players were unwilling to read the novice guide. In the test, even if players were required not to skip the guide and to follow the guide prompts, they would still miss a lot of information.</p>
<p>Psychological research also confirms that this “invisibility” of players is not only common, but also innate, and is related to the selective attention mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See"><a href="#2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See"></a>2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See</h2><p>If the human brain is a TV set, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. Only the TV programs that finally appear on the screen can be noticed by us. Although in many cases people can consciously choose which programs to watch, in many cases, this choice is subconscious. Among them, those that do not require will effort and that people can naturally pay attention to are called involuntary attention. For example, it is difficult not to hear the ringing of a mobile phone in a quiet meeting room; a red flower in a green lawn will be more conspicuous than a green flower. The act of paying attention that requires will effort and needs to be actively made is called voluntary attention, such as reviewing homework before an exam, learning some useful but boring new knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>It is theorized that involuntary attention is a subconscious response and does not occupy psychological resources; but voluntary attention requires the player’s resources. Therefore, when receiving multiple external information, due to limited cognitive resources, players will selectively pay attention, that is, only see what they want to see and the most important information, while ignoring other information.</p>
<p>In the game, if the player cannot see the guide, it means that the current guide is likely to occupy too many resources, causing the player to spend too much effort to play the game. If you want the novice of the game to be noticed by the player, you need to manage the player’s attention and try to attract the player’s involuntary attention.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Kind-of-Information-is-Easier-to-be-Seen-Information-That-is-Different-and-Information-That-Matches-Your-Interests"><a href="#3-What-Kind-of-Information-is-Easier-to-be-Seen-Information-That-is-Different-and-Information-That-Matches-Your-Interests" class="headerlink" title="3. What Kind of Information is Easier to be Seen: Information That is Different and Information That Matches Your Interests"></a>3. What Kind of Information is Easier to be Seen: Information That is Different and Information That Matches Your Interests</h2><p>So, how to attract the player’s involuntary attention and let the player see it effortlessly? The reasons for attracting involuntary attention can be summarized into two categories:</p>
<h3 id="The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated"><a href="#The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated" class="headerlink" title="The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated."></a>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated.</h3><p>For example, it can be something unusual happening suddenly in the game, or it can be a significant difference from the surrounding game scene.</p>
<p>For example, when the game needs to guide the player to perform a dodge operation, there are generally prompts in the form of guide text or screen special effects. If the screen color or brightness changes significantly when the boss releases a skill, for example, a bright red circle appears in the skill range, the player will be able to pay attention to it at once without additional effort; but if there is only a change in the content of the guide text on the screen, the player is likely to not see it. Because the guide task prompts in the game are generally fixed on the left side of the screen, when the guide continues to appear in this state, in the player’s view, this area lacks change and lacks distinction from the surrounding scene, so it will be instinctively ignored.</p>
<h3 id="The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs"><a href="#The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs" class="headerlink" title="The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs."></a>The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs.</h3><p>In other words, the more the information matches the player’s interests, the more attention it can attract.</p>
<p>For example, when a new player encounters a new type of game for the first time, he will have some questions in his mind and expect a novice tutorial to guide his operation. At this time, the guide that pops up will be more easily noticed; and when a veteran player is playing the game, he has no expectations or related needs for guidance, so he often operates before consciousness and is more likely to not see the relevant guidance in the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design"><a href="#4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design" class="headerlink" title="4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?"></a>4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?</h2><p>How can the above characteristics related to attention guide the novice design of the game? Here are just a few interesting examples.</p>
<h3 id="Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance"><a href="#Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance" class="headerlink" title="Which form is better for novice guidance?"></a>Which form is better for novice guidance?</h3><p>Common novice guides are presented in text, pictures, and videos. According to our life experience, we will think that words are not as good as pictures, and pictures are not as good as videos. Some studies have also confirmed that paying attention to pictures can improve learning effects more than paying attention to text. But other studies have shown that it is not absolute that pictures are better than text, and the contrast effect needs to be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 1: Look at words when there are many pictures, and look at pictures when there are many words, highlighting the differences.</strong></p>
<p>When we observe real-world scenes, our attention is always attracted by the text embedded in these scenes, for example, text on signs or billboards. A study of travel photos found that people look more at the text in the pictures, and no matter what the text content is, they will pay attention to the text. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F2f60333d-14ad-4dbb-8e4c-40288171235d.png/size/" alt="A photo, as described in the article."></p>
<p>When we conducted eye-tracking tests on <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we also unexpectedly found that for the text and picture guides presented simultaneously in the game, the player’s gaze duration on the text was significantly longer than that on the pictures. In other words, people are always more likely to pay attention to information that is different. Whether the game chooses text guidance or picture guidance needs to be determined according to the characteristics of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F5812121f-25e2-4249-8f45-68aba68b7923.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Novice Guide Player Eye-tracking Heat Map</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But once the research scene is changed to a text-based webpage, the situation changes. Eye-tracking data shows that the pictures in the text pile are more eye-catching. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff1dc0888-a6a9-4ec4-abc4-a2db13f4a967.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Eye-tracking heat map for a webpage, the subject’s gaze is concentrated on the picture</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 2: Less is more, the more white space, the easier it is to be seen</strong></p>
<p>When there is too little white space between the logo and the main title, people will spend more time looking at the logo instead of the main title. And when the distance between the logo and the main title is increased, people’s attention to the title will increase. When two buttons are too close, they will also compete for attention. After changing to only one option, people’s visual attention increases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F7c2b20ea-0f3e-41c8-9ddb-e7ccf17e8b46.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>After the spacing is changed, the subject’s attention to the title increases</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In games, in order not to compete for attention, you can increase the white space between important prompts and buttons, and at the same time avoid dense presentation of important information in a paragraph of text.</p>
<h3 id="In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention"><a href="#In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention" class="headerlink" title="In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?"></a>In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?</h3><p>For the common problem that players cannot understand the guidance, developers easily want to “write more detailed guidance information” to help players understand. But the contrast effect has pointed out that dense text will cause players’ attention to be scattered, and to highlight the key points, more attention needs to be paid to white space. So, what else can be done?</p>
<p><strong>Multichannel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation</strong></p>
<p>Compared with players who only pay attention to vision or hearing, players who pay attention to both the visual and auditory channels process information faster and more accurately. Auditory information can attract the player’s visual attention to the direction pointed to by the auditory signal, and improve the efficiency of subsequent information processing.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, when players are near a Mongolian camp, they may hear singing, drumming, and playing the morin khuur; they may also hear the playing of the pipa, and players can follow the sound to find the storyteller, thus being led to new tasks. Foxes are another example. Their short, sharp calls manage the player’s attention early on, making it difficult for the player to miss the guidance and ultimately leading the player to the shrine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F38d7d80f-5dbe-4e98-8a72-0eeea8344ac4.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster"><a href="#Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster" class="headerlink" title="Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster"></a>Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster</h3><p><strong>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text, the better the learning</strong></p>
<p>The position of pictures and text will also affect people’s attention to learning materials. The closer the pictures and text, the longer the gaze duration, the more gaze times, and the better the memory of the knowledge points afterwards; and when the pictures and text are close, people’s gaze point switching between the pictures and text is more frequent. This means that the proximity effect affects people’s attention allocation, thereby improving the learning effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3f3acdd7-31ea-406b-b1a1-a8070e0e8b4f.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>“The formation principle of lightning” as learning material, the right picture is the picture-text proximity group, the learning effect is better</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points</strong></p>
<p>Designers always want to use visual cues to try to guide users’ browsing direction on a webpage, so are some visual cues more effective than others? Some studies have tried different forms such as hand-drawn arrows, character photos (looking at the table &amp; facing away from the table), line prompts, and adding border outlines. The final result shows that visual cues do affect users’ attention to the form, with hand-drawn arrows leading to the most user attention to the form. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa0a63665-6040-41a9-ade4-5425d86195e9.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>The player’s turning a blind eye is more related to the selective attention mechanism, and the characteristics of attention determine that people will only see what they want to see. Game design should pay attention to the player’s attention management, try to attract the player’s involuntary attention, rather than forcing indoctrination. For example, you can consider making the information more different and making the information more in line with the player’s current interests. Specifically in the design, the contrast effect, proximity effect, multichannel presentation, line guidance, etc. can all be used as design guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the German Game Market"></a>1. Overview of the German Game Market</h2><p>Germany is located in central Europe. It is the engine of Europe and also the largest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Data shows that Germany’s total GDP in 2022 was 27.38 trillion.</p>
<p>After setting a revenue record in 2020, the German game market also achieved explosive growth in 2021, with a total revenue (including hardware, games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases) of approximately 9.76 billion euros. Compared with 2012, it has more than tripled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F0577e133-b993-4283-8938-df10249a1715.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>As of 2021, German game market revenue (published on February 23, 2023)</em></p>
<p>The growing demand of German players for game-related hardware (especially consoles) is considered to be an important driving force for the booming German game market. Although some game consoles were in short supply due to the impact of the epidemic on the supply chain and logistics, the overall revenue of consoles also resisted the pressure and increased by 23%, reaching 808 million euros. Revenue from in-app purchases has also increased. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fe20c6691-9d75-4f14-8349-8446df2ae533.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>German hardware revenue achieved huge growth in 2021</em></p>
<p>It is worth noting that, in addition to areas strongly related to games, such as game copies and hardware, which have performed well, the market for game furniture and game accessories in Germany is also gradually taking the stage. According to a survey by the German Game Industry Association, nearly millions of players have purchased game-related furniture, and more than 11 million players plan to purchase game-related furniture, including gaming chairs, computer stands, controller stands, lamps, etc. Therefore, many well-known furniture manufacturers in Germany have also launched their game series furniture in order to occupy this huge market early. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F556d943f-5330-4021-9f2d-38fdfacceaca.png/size/"></p>
<p>From a platform perspective, according to statistics from the German Game Association, as of 2022, there are 23.5 million mobile game players in Germany. In addition, there are 10.7 million users who use tablets to play games. The number of mobile game users accounts for a relatively high proportion.</p>
<p>The demand of German players for consoles (such as Switch, PlayStation, Xbox) is also basically increasing year by year. It may be that the impact of the epidemic is getting smaller and smaller, and most Germans are no longer locked down at home, so the number of PC players has decreased slightly in comparison. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff8b65aab-f810-4ca3-9c34-19207216004c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base"><a href="#2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base" class="headerlink" title="2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base"></a>2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base</h2><p>According to the latest population statistics in 2022, Germany has a total population of 82.196 million. Its game penetration rate is nearly 60%, which means that 6 out of every 10 people have gaming experience, and the number of game players is approaching 50 million.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quality of German game users is also very high. Most German players believe that payment is a guarantee of game quality, and their willingness to pay is second only to the United States. Nearly 70% of players are willing to pay for games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F68d60fbd-52ef-4ecd-8411-5b87fafeadf5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Note: The data comes from a questionnaire survey conducted by Gamma Data (CNG) on mobile game user groups in the United States&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;France&#x2F;United Kingdom.)</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, according to data from the German Federal Statistical Office, except for the elderly group over 75 years old, the largest age group in Germany is 55-59 years old, accounting for 8.2% of the total population. The average age of the German population has reached 47 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F8f28d6d7-6457-40df-900c-d6057eef668c.png/size/"></p>
<p>The serious aging of the population has also increased the average age of game players. According to survey data from market research company GfK: The proportion of middle-aged and elderly players in Germany aged 50-59 reached 18%, which is the highest proportion of age groups. Many players in the 1980s and 1990s have maintained their hobby of playing video games to this day. At the same time, the average age of German game players is also increasing year by year: in 2020, the average age of players was 37.4 years old, and in 2021, it has reached 37.6 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa29b2c20-9ae4-44a6-aab9-949502d0ba86.png/size/"></p>
<p>Germany has a general trend of an aging society, so German residents are rigorous, relatively conservative, pay attention to order, and are less social. Nearly 80% of players will learn about product user reviews, overall ratings, and descriptions before downloading the game. At the same time, the relatively conservative characteristics are also subtly affecting the aesthetics of Germans. For example, Germans tend to wear darker clothes, and like to wear practical clothes such as jackets. At the same time, they are also conservative in the aesthetic style of games, and do not like overly chaotic and bright colors.</p>
<p>For example, in the evaluation of the appearance of female characters in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some German players gave positive comments because some female characters did not wear high heels, which is very practical in actual combat.</p>
<p>Therefore, grasping the above characteristics of German players can help game manufacturers to be more successful when going overseas to Germany. At the same time, these characteristics are also reflected in German players’ preferences for games.</p>
<h2 id="3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices"><a href="#3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices" class="headerlink" title="3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices"></a>3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices</h2><p>Rigorous and conservative Germans maintain their consistent habits in the choice of game genres: strategy games are especially popular. Surveys show that the 5 most popular game categories in Germany in 2022 are: strategy, action, action-adventure, adventure, and simulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc8d90a2d-2444-4364-8533-e9f50e0dbbb6.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to data from Data.ai, among the games with the most downloads by German players, strategy games + match-3 games account for 70% of the list. The Top 10 of the list are basically casual puzzle games, which is also in line with the needs of middle-aged and elderly players for game choices: they don’t need to spend too much time, the gameplay is not particularly intense, and they can sit quietly on the sofa and use their brains. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fb235ef91-07af-453f-b561-e4318c0fc947.png/size/"></p>
<p>The loyalty of the German mobile game market is very high, which is not only reflected in the choice of games: <em>Coin Master</em>, which ranks first in mobile game revenue, was released 13 years ago, but it still occupies the top few positions in the German game list for many years. Classic match-3 games like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> have also been released for 9 years. Most of the games on the list are old games that have been released for more than two years. It can be seen that Germans are very dedicated to their favorite games.</p>
<p>In addition, their choice of game genres is also very single, fixed on strategy, elimination, and simulation management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3a93b057-1e16-4bd9-bf7e-4a50e88642e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The rankings of PC and console games are very different from those of mobile games. In addition to the simulation management games that German players love, most of the PC games on the list are relatively hardcore. <em>EA Sports FIFA 22</em>, which was just released by EA, once again topped the sales chart, which shows the German players’ love for football. It is followed by the open-world game <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched by Rockstar. The third place is the racing game <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. The fourth place is <em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, and the fifth place is <em>Minecraft</em>. Most of the games on the list can meet the needs of teaming up or have pvp modes, which can meet some competitive needs of hardcore PC players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc765c7f5-35c6-4ef7-a2d0-eb93d8897cad.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The game culture in Germany is very mature, and many players have been exposed to games since childhood. In addition, German players have a high willingness to pay. Due to the aging of the population, the average age of players has increased, which is also the reason why German players have relatively strong payment capabilities. As the engine of the European economy, Germany also has one of the largest game markets in Europe, with almost 60% of Germans having gaming experience.</p>
<p>Unlike Chinese players, console games still maintain a high status in Germany, but the development of mobile games has surpassed traditional games, and more than 70% of players play mobile games.</p>
<p>In addition, German players have obvious “nostalgic” characteristics. Most of the various rankings are old games that have been online for more than 2 years, and the genres are relatively single. This also brings a lot of pressure to some new products that want to enter the German market. But on the other hand, when you want to enter the German market, the selection of products is more accurate. Once a new product is accepted by players, it is easier to stabilize and settle down.</p>

    <title>ChatGPT Evaluation Is It a Good Translation Tool</title>
    <url>/2023/03/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20230424_28584_1084772/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230424/28584_1084772.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has made continuous progress, and its application scenarios have continued to expand and deepen. AIGC, or AI-generated content, has broken through the public’s cognitive and imaginative boundaries of AI technology. With its outstanding capabilities in content creation such as voice, text, images, videos, and others, it may pose a huge challenge to a large number of practitioners in various industries, such as artists, engineers, and designers, and the era of change it triggers is obvious.</p>
<p>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a natural language processing tool driven by artificial intelligence technology, a specific application and product of AIGC. It can understand and learn human language to conduct conversations, interact based on the context of the chat, really chat and communicate like humans, and even complete tasks such as writing emails, video scripts, copywriting, translation, code, and writing papers.</p>
<p>For the gaming industry, possible application scenarios of AIGC include: AI drawing, AI dubbing, copywriting planning, faster collection of materials and information, operations can use templates for writing, and programmers can use it to write and debug computer programs.</p>
<p>So, for localization services, can ChatGPT’s translation function be implemented in practical application scenarios? This article will select <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> translated text of different styles, use the translation results of human translators as the standard, and use BLEU scoring and manual evaluation to compare the translation results of Deepl and ChatGPT, two machine translation tools, in order to obtain a preliminary conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="1-Test-Preparation"><a href="#1-Test-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="1. Test Preparation"></a>1. Test Preparation</h2><p>First, we made a series of preparations before the test, and determined the selection of tools, data, standards, and other dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ChatGPT version:</strong> 3.5</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation data:</strong> 4 sets of representative texts were selected from the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> translation library as evaluation data</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Machine translation tool:</strong> Deepl</p>
<p>The reason for choosing Deepl is that it performs relatively more accurately in terms of translation quality, especially in the translation of words and phrases. Relatively speaking, Google Translate is suitable for general translation tasks, such as daily expressions, simple business communication, etc., but the translation quality is relatively average. Deepl is suitable for more professional translation tasks, such as translating technical documents, academic papers, etc., or occasions that require higher translation quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Test languages:</strong> Chinese, English, Spanish</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation standard:</strong> BLEU score</p>
<p>BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is used to evaluate the correspondence between machine translation and professional human translation. The core idea is that the closer the machine translation is to professional human translation, the better the quality. BLEU is the oldest, most commonly used, and most classic indicator in the field of machine translation. Most machine translation papers even use only this one indicator as the evaluation standard of the system, and its importance is obvious.</p>
<p>Although BLEU scoring is a widely used automatic evaluation method, it also has some shortcomings: it cannot consider semantic and contextual information, it is sensitive to the number of standard reference texts, it can only be based on n-gram matching, and it cannot handle rare words. Therefore, it needs to be combined with other evaluation methods for comprehensive evaluation to accurately assess translation quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Test-Method"><a href="#2-Test-Method" class="headerlink" title="2. Test Method"></a>2. Test Method</h2><p>This article selects four different types of existing translations of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, including skill descriptions, background stories, action descriptions, and literary classical style. In order to compare the translation effects of Deepl and ChatGPT, we use them to perform “Chinese-English”, “Chinese-Spanish”, and “English-Spanish” operations respectively. At the same time, we use the translation results of human translators as the standard and use BLEU to score the above translations. By comparing the BLEU scores of various translations, we can evaluate the performance of Deepl and ChatGPT in terms of translation quality and provide a basis for subsequent analysis.</p>

<li><p><strong>Similarity to Human Translation</strong></p>
<p>In terms of absolute score, the BLEU score can indicate the quality of machine translation. The higher the score, the higher the degree of matching between the machine translation result and the reference translation, and the better the quality of the machine translation. Generally speaking, a score higher than 40 can be considered a good machine translation result. In our evaluation results, only one score of Deepl and ChatGPT each exceeded 40. This shows that at this stage, the similarity between machine translation results and human translation results is low, and the practical effect is not good.</p>
<p>In terms of relative score, among the 12 BLEU scores, only 5 scores of ChatGPT are higher than Deepl, which shows that the similarity between ChatGPT translation and human translation is lower than that of Deepl.</p>
<p>In order to verify the reliability of this result, we checked the test results of other scholars. The BLEU evaluation results for 50 sentences showed that the average scores of Deepl and ChatGPT for Chinese-English translation were lower than 40, and the similarity between ChatGPT translation and human translation was lower than that of Deepl.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>English to Spanish is Better Than Chinese to Spanish</strong></p>
<p>From a vertical perspective, whether it is Deepl or ChatGPT, the scores of English-Spanish are higher than those of Chinese-Spanish. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of the size of the corpus, the translations of Deepl and ChatGPT are based on their respective Internet corpora, and it is obvious that the corpus of English-Spanish is richer than that of Chinese-Spanish. It is estimated that the number of English-Spanish corpora currently used for machine translation has reached millions to tens of millions; while the number of corpora translated from Chinese to Spanish is only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Because of language similarity, Chinese and Spanish have low similarity. Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, and Spanish belongs to the Romance language family, with great differences in grammar and vocabulary; although English belongs to the Germanic language family and Spanish belongs to the Romance language family, both belong to the Indo-European language family, and there are many similarities in grammar and vocabulary; at the same time, compared with Asian culture, the cultural background differences between English and Spanish, which are both in the Western world, are small.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Human-Analysis"><a href="#Human-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Human Analysis"></a>Human Analysis</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>
<p>With a huge Internet corpus and clever grammar rule settings, the grammar of machine translation is almost always compliant. When translating long sentences, machine translation can skillfully use various adverbs and clauses to completely express the original text, presenting a good translation result.</p>
<p>However, there are some subtle deficiencies when subjective judgment is required. For example, in the English-Spanish translation of hero skills, English omits the subject of the whole paragraph when translating hero skills. When human translators deal with it, considering that it describes hero skills, they use the hero as the subject, while Deepl uses the player as the subject, and ChatGPT directly processes it into a sentence without a subject. In contrast, human translators are better when subjective judgment is required.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wording</strong></p>
<p>The performance of machine translation in terms of wording is average. For simple action descriptions and storytelling, machine translation can do the job. However, once it encounters words that need to be deeply understood, such as game terminology, idioms, cultural backgrounds, and mythological allusions, machine translation will face huge challenges and often fail to translate accurately, and may even make serious mistakes. This is because these words have complex meanings and cultural backgrounds, and need to be understood in conjunction with context and context, and machine translation is currently difficult to achieve complete human understanding.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game terminology</strong></p>
<p>“单双排” (dān shuāng pái) is a basic game term used to describe the mode in which players participate in the game. Human translators correctly translated it as “Solo and Duos”.</p>
<p>However, the machine translation performance was poor, and they were all processed as “single and double rows” (Deepl) and “single and double formations” (ChatGPT). This shows that there are still defects in machine translation in identifying and understanding game terminology.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Idioms and sayings</strong></p>
<p>“老当益壮” (lǎo dāng yì zhuàng) means that one is old, but his physical strength and spirit are stronger. The human translator did not translate it literally, but adopted the method of free translation, “move with the energy of a man half your age”.</p>
<p>Deepl’s processing is very direct, “old and strong”, simple and crude; ChatGPT is relatively smarter, “is aging like wine”, which means “get better over time”. Although it has been interpreted, it is not completely consistent with the meaning of praising physical strength and spirit. Moreover, it is not appropriate to use it in the context of “Shen Miao praising grandpa for being old and strong”.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mythological allusions</strong></p>
<p>“鱼化龙” (yú huà lóng) is an ancient Chinese legend that tells the story of an ordinary carp that finally succeeded in becoming a dragon through continuous efforts. Chinese players understand this word with almost no cultural barriers, but Western players basically do not have this cultural background. Therefore, in order to better convey the connotation of the allusion, the human translator translated it on the basis of a simple explanation, “Like the ancient fish of legend, growing legs and rising to become dragons”.</p>
<p>However, the machine translation simply translated it according to the literal meaning, “transform from a fish to a dragon” (Deepl), “rise like a dragon from a fish” (ChatGPT).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural background</strong></p>
<p>“神机营” (shén jī yíng) was one of the three major battalions of the capital’s forbidden army in the Ming Dynasty. It was a special force in the Ming Dynasty army that specialized in managing firearms. Therefore, when the human translator dealt with it, it was translated as “Firearms Division”.</p>
<p>Deepl translated it as “Divine Machine Camp”, and ChatGPT translated it as “Divine Machine Corps”. I wonder what foreign players think when they see the magical machine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Literariness</strong></p>
<p>When describing Ning Hongye’s bundled Pear Garden White Element, the planner quoted the Yue opera “The Legend of the White Snake” lyrics: “冲出峨嵋万重山，踏破云层往人间” (chōng chū é méi wàn chóng shān, tà pò yún céng wǎng rén jiān). It is Bai Suzhen’s monologue after she transformed into a human and walked out of Mount Emei. The main meaning of this lyric is that the white snake breaks through the barriers of the many peaks of Emei, treads through the clouds, and comes to the human world from the sky. This expresses that the white snake does not hesitate to venture out of the mountain to stay with Xu Xian, overcomes many obstacles, transforms into a human form and comes to the human world.</p>
<p>The translator’s translation is: “Lo, she bursts forth from the myriad peaks of Emei, Clouds treaded underfoot, down from heavens high in the sky.” The wording is gorgeous and poetic. “Lo” is used to express surprise or attention, and is more common in literary works or religious texts. “Bursts forth” is used to describe breaking through, which means breaking through obstacles and breaking through constraints, which is more vivid. “Myriad peaks” expresses the meaning of numerous and countless peaks, which is more gorgeous. “Clouds treaded underfoot” refers to stepping on clouds, which has a magical and romantic mood. “Down from heavens high in the sky” expresses the mysterious feeling of falling from the sky and being high above, which is more poetic.</p>
<p>Deepl’s translation is “Break out of Emei’s ten thousand mountains and step through the clouds to earth.” ChatGPT’s translation is “Breaking through the Emei Mountains, stepping through the clouds towards the mortal realm.” Although they can express the meaning of the original text, they use relatively straightforward expressions, lacking beauty and mysticism. Among them, “Break out of” and “Breaking through” are directly translated as “冲出” (chōng chū), lacking the details and beauty of the action; “万重山” (wàn chóng shān) is literally translated as “ten thousand mountains” by Deepl, while ChatGPT ignores the adjective “万重” (wàn chóng), thus losing the description of the towering mountains in the original text; “to earth” and “towards the mortal realm” Although it expresses the meaning of “往人间” (wǎng rén jiān), it lacks a certain sense of mysticism, making it impossible for readers to feel the emotions in the original text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>It will take time for machine translation to dominate.</p>
<p>At this stage, machine translations represented by Deepl and ChatGPT perform well in terms of grammar, but perform poorly when it comes to understanding game terminology, idioms, cultural backgrounds, and mythological allusions, or when literary interpretation is required.</p>
<p>Overall, the machine translation results are quite different from the human translation results. In practice, translators need to make major adjustments to the machine translation results to meet the requirements; the ideal working mode at present is still human-based and machine-assisted.</p>
<p>Using cooking as an analogy, the current level of machine translation is equivalent to preparing and matching some raw materials, waiting for the chef to cook, to make delicious dishes. The chef’s level has a greater impact on the final result.</p>
<p>Compared with machine translation tools such as Deepl, ChatGPT, as a model that can be continuously iterated and learned, may reach the level of fast food in the future, which can be eaten by simply heating, and has almost no requirements for human cooking skills. But as for how it tastes, it still needs time to test. But it is foreseeable that ChatGPT has a promising future!</p>

    <title>How to Leverage the Positive Effects of Geographic Location Information in Game Design</title>
    <url>/2023/04/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20230508_28584_1087004/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230508/28584_1087004.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the development of mobile information technology, the technology of obtaining users’ geographical coordinates through signals has been widely used in all aspects of our lives. Naturally, geographic location information has also been widely used in games.</p>
<p>When it comes to game design based on geographic location information, the first thing that comes to mind is probably <em>Pokémon GO</em>. The gameplay of this game is based on augmented reality (AR) technology. Players need to collect, battle, and train Pokémon in the real world. In addition, based on LBS (Location Based Services) technology, players can deeply integrate the real map with the game screen and explore in the real world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ffac7fbb0-c573-4f56-a1a8-ee7a1e81ce0f.png/size/"></p>
<p>But in fact, in addition to being embedded in the gameplay, geographic location information also plays a positive role in the design of other game systems. This article will start from the system functions and briefly discuss the application of geographic location information in the design of game system functions and the positive effects it brings.</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements"><a href="#1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements"></a>1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements</h2><p>In some games with high DAU, it is very difficult for individual players to get on the global leaderboard. For those players who do not have the strength to get on the global leaderboard, but have a high demand for achievement goals, sub-leaderboards can meet their needs for a sense of achievement. The more detailed the leaderboard, the more achievement goal directions players can pursue – “With so many leaderboards, I can always excel in one.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F678a763f-437f-4511-b0fc-80cef6a46a2b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to in-game attributes, many games now introduce the concept of players’ provinces and cities in reality, and divide player groups based on players’ geographic information, so that players in the same group are in a large leaderboard. It is common in some games with strong confrontation. For example, in <em>Onmyoji Arena</em>, which everyone is familiar with, the game ranks players of each Shikigami in their province and city. The ranking reflects the level of players playing a certain hero. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Fce2bf088-2ec0-48e1-a947-14d718ff59d5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Such a regionally-subdivided ranking, first of all, will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking. Players may have a vague perception of how many people are playing a game in the country, but their cognition of how many people are playing around them is clearer. For example, “Shanghai’s No. 1 Yoto Hime”, friends in Shanghai will have a relatively concrete feeling of the weight of this “No. 1”.</p>
<p>Secondly, the relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Friends who can get together in reality have similar life trajectories, and most of them live in nearby areas, so they have a stronger sense of the fun of regional ranking topics. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate you to pursue the ranking. For example, we are going to have a five-player game in a party. I don’t know many heroes and I quickly choose Oitsuki. My friend says, “I’ll take the mid lane, you just lie down and win. Let me, Hangzhou’s No. 8 Higanbana, carry you.” It’s not that I really care about my friend’s skills, but this kind of talk makes people feel “Oh, that’s interesting”, and the feedback from everyone increases Higanbana’s pride in this ranking.</p>
<p>This kind of ranking based on geographic location grouping is not limited to the form of a leaderboard. There are also common regional online events. Players in the same region are used as a group for internal competition, and the winning players will get corresponding achievements in the game. Although it is not in the form of a leaderboard, it can also motivate players to pursue their achievement goals. For example, the China Online Tour in <em>UNO!</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F462b365e-d0f8-4b4b-b9e6-05e52f479a84.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition"><a href="#2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition"></a>2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition</h2><p>In addition to ranking within the group, ranking with geographic location as a natural group link and group as a unit will also motivate players’ game behavior. For example, in <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, which went viral on the Internet at the end of 2022, for this game with a very low clearance rate, on the one hand, players all hope to be the lucky one to clear the level with a small probability. On the other hand, the reason why many players keep playing tirelessly may be to help their province’s sheep team to be on the top sheep list of the day. The extremely low clearance rate and the setting of ranking by region as a group greatly stimulate players’ desire for challenge and sense of collective honor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ff7d70648-f953-45c3-9336-af55c979bb03.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, regional ranking is more of a group achievement, and the individual’s sense of achievement is not so strong. At first glance, you may wonder why this regional ranking can also motivate players. This involves the relationship between individual interests and group interests. Group members will unite against outsiders, and individuals belonging to the group will hope that the group will develop better. It is a behavioral preference rooted in the human genes. The formation of this preference is related to the development of human ethnic groups, which has always been in groups.</p>
<p>First of all, people living in the same area often have a sense of belonging and identity, believing that they are a part of this place, so they have the responsibility and obligation to contribute to this place, so as to maintain and enhance the interests of their community or region. In addition, our traditional culture emphasizes the relationship between individuals and society relatively more, advocating that individuals contribute to society. Under the influence of this culture, players may have a stronger sense of responsibility and obligation to their location. And some regions are relatively strong in culture or economy, which may enhance the pride of local people in their regional identity, thereby enhancing their motivation to “help the sheep team of their province to be on the top sheep list of the day.”</p>
<h2 id="3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience"><a href="#3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience"></a>3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience</h2><p>The most basic use of geographic location information in games is that in the player’s personal information, the player can choose to display their city coordinates. With coordinate information, when other players view your profile, if your cities are geographically close, or even in the same city, you can quickly identify it. For example, in MMO games, players often have an in-game personal information display page, where players can display their city coordinates. Of course, players can also choose not to display them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F36833c5d-735a-4e36-ade5-323c59cefe95.png/size/"></p>
<p>Some games apply the distance information between the two parties in more detail. For example, in <em>Onmyoji</em>, players can see the distance between the speaker and their real coordinates in the chat channel. Even the game chat channel directly opens “Nearby”, which is convenient for players to directly find and interact with nearby like-minded people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F293cf958-98ae-41e9-9106-37d307478b98.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to individuals, the game also adds the dimension of geographic location information to group interaction. Players can use the geographic location service (LBS) function to associate their location information with the Onmyoji guild. First of all, the game requires choosing a real coordinate to create a guild. Players can use the LBS function to search for nearby guilds in the real world and join them. Based on such functional logic, most of the players in the same guild are near the guild coordinates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F5b2a2907-aa74-4403-a13d-3fd9c7c6f868.png/size/"></p>
<p>The game will design such a geographic location service in social functions, which actually hits the preference that players always prefer people who are geographically closer in social interactions with strangers. This preference exists even if players do not consider meeting in person or transforming these online social interactions into offline ones.</p>
<p>The psychological distance theory believes that, taking the direct experience of the results of this time, this place, certainty, and oneself as the origin, any indirect experience in any dimension is psychologically distant. Things are scattered in the psychological space according to different dimensions, forming different types of psychological distance. Psychological distance includes four dimensions: time distance, space distance, social distance, and probability distance.</p>
<p>Players usually use various attributes as a measure of the social distance between themselves and other players, such as similar interests and hobbies (same hobby group) and similar strength levels (game combat power or rank). Similar spatial distance is also a natural attribute that quickly shortens the social distance between players, which means that the closer the players are in geographical distance, the higher their initial closeness to each other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F9382b0d7-3c9c-4c4e-9421-7b6fede7a895.png/size/"></p>
<p>And in the process of interaction, the advantages brought by geographic location are not only at the beginning. Friends who are geographically close can continue to receive more attention from players. In-group favoritism is a pattern of cognitive behavior, which means that individuals form an identity with people in the group, and therefore give more positive evaluations, allocate more resources, while giving more negative evaluations or allocating fewer resources to people outside the group. The proximity of geographic location is a kind of in-group division mark. This kind of in-group preference based on geographic area can encourage these players to communicate and support each other more, such as the phenomenon of people in the same area forming groups. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F3a2fd2db-bedd-4586-85fb-377de9c0db61.png/size/"></p>
<p>Players will prefer people who are geographically closer, which may be influenced by past social experience in addition to natural human cognitive preferences - they find that people from similar regions are more talkative and get along better. Playing games with people who are close to the geographic area, due to similarities in living background, language, cultural customs, and daily travel trajectories, it is easier to establish a common experience and common identity, thereby enhancing the sense of belonging and emotional connection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for players who have a need gap in real-world social interaction, although they are socializing in the online world, they essentially still hope to establish relatively stable social relationships. Scholar Sherry Turkle (2005) calls the identity in the virtual online world “mud” - it has fluidity, can play with and shape its own form at will, and play different roles.</p>
<p>In the world of online games, the identity of strangers is difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the truth seems to be unimportant. Because strangers lack the fulcrum of real connection, they are like duckweed that blows away. Real connection means the relative authenticity of identity, reducing the sense of haziness and ambiguity in the process of interaction. Therefore, if the online relationship is to develop further, it must provide some kind of certainty and build a trust mechanism. Players who are geographically close are more likely to have some offline contact, such as offline gatherings, group games, etc. The “face-to-face” meeting link can reduce the uncertainty of online identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F6a1ec6b0-141c-4cae-b370-eaca63fc89e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The social penetration theory believes that the degree of self-disclosure between the two parties is the core of relationship development. The more offline contact, the more real life players present to each other. While increasing mutual trust, they will also show more aspects of real self-exposure in reality. Players have more bonds with each other, promoting the transformation of weak social ties into strong ties, and are more likely to settle into stable social relationships.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The application of geographic location information can play a certain role in motivating players’ social interaction, sense of achievement, etc. When conducting game design, we can better utilize these aspects to bring beneficial effects to the game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using players’ geographic information as a dimension of leaderboards to motivate players to pursue achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The difficulty of getting on the global leaderboard is greater. The more diversified the leaderboard, the more leaderboard achievement-seeking players can be covered.</li>
<li>Regional leaderboards will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking.</li>
<li>The relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate players to pursue the ranking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divide groups based on players’ geographic information to increase motivation for competition:</strong><br>People living in the same area often have a sense of belonging and identity, believing that they are a part of this place and want to maintain and enhance the interests of their community or region. Our traditional culture emphasizes the relationship between individuals and society relatively more, and Chinese players have a stronger sense of pursuit of group ranking goals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use real coordinate information to enhance players’ social motivation and experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The closer the players are in geographical distance, the higher their initial closeness to each other.</li>
<li>Friends who are geographically close can continue to receive more attention from players during the interaction.</li>
<li>Players who are geographically close are more likely to have some offline contact, which can reduce the uncertainty of online identity. Offline interaction will also show more aspects of real self-exposure in reality, promoting the transformation of weak social ties into strong ties.</li>

<p>In the past, many people believed that colors had some kind of mysterious power. Modern psychologists also believe that colors are related to the human brain and have a profound impact on human emotions and behavior. Data shows that when people observe objects, the first 20 seconds are basically spent on the appearance, of which the perception of color accounts for 85%, and the perception of shape accounts for 15%; after two minutes, the color drops to 75%, and after 5 minutes, it tends to be half and half.</p>
<p>The impression color gives to people is rapid, profound, and lasting, which also determines what the first impression of many things is. This article will combine color knowledge and the practical application of color in game design to reveal the answer one by one. Is color psychology really pseudoscience?</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts"><a href="#1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Color to Convey Concepts"></a>1. Using Color to Convey Concepts</h2><h3 id="Physical-Characteristics"><a href="#Physical-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Physical Characteristics"></a>Physical Characteristics</h3><p>On the basis of the same elements or shapes, using different color schemes will present different themes. The well-known art concept designer OLDFISH also emphasized the importance of physical characteristics presented through colors for concept communication. At the same time, colors will also produce differences in material communication. The same shape can be expressed as silver, gold and other materials by giving different inherent colors and light and shadow relationships.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Characteristics"><a href="#Cultural-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Characteristics"></a>Cultural Characteristics</h3><p>Some specific colors can express certain cultural characteristics. When people habitually give a specific meaning to a certain group of colors and continue to use them, over time, they will become the symbolic color of this thing, most commonly seen in religion, aristocratic culture, ancient class systems, and customs.</p>
<p>The same color may represent different or even completely opposite meanings in different cultural backgrounds. These cultural connotations related to color will also be reflected in the design of some games. For example, in Chinese culture, red often represents festivity and good luck, while in some Western contexts it sometimes symbolizes violence, blood, and tension. Therefore, in many game scenes with an oriental background, redwood buildings or red decorations often appear, while game scenes with a Western background are relatively rare, mainly using original wood colors, gray, beige, etc. as the main color scheme of residential buildings. Of course, scene design is largely related to the era in which the game background&#x2F;worldview is located and the theme of the game itself, but as an important element in different cultures, color can also inspire many different design ideas for artists.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Characteristics"><a href="#Emotional-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Characteristics"></a>Emotional Characteristics</h3><p>The influence of color on people’s emotions is subtle, and the psychological implications of different colors are also different. To give some common examples in life, the color scheme of many fast food restaurants is red and yellow, giving people a fast-paced psychological suggestion; while hospital rooms are usually decorated in white, light blue and other light colors, which can give people a sense of stability and comfort, which is conducive to soothing emotions.</p>
<p>In the process of game design, color is also a direct and powerful way to evoke players’ emotions. Research on some players by an organization shows that yellow usually means “fun” in the hearts of players, while red usually means “anger”. Of course, these studies are not absolute, but can represent a certain color design trend, which is inseparable from the player’s psychological state. But it is undeniable that the use of different colors can indeed evoke certain specific emotions in people’s hearts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Contrasting-Color-Matching"><a href="#2-Contrasting-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrasting Color Matching"></a>2. Contrasting Color Matching</h2><p>According to the strength of the contrast of color attributes, color matching can be roughly divided into complementary colors, contrasting colors, and medium-difference colors. The stronger the contrast of color matching, the higher the recognition between colors. Many game artists use this principle to design scenes, character costumes, etc., which makes it easier to cut the picture and make the strong and weak distinct.</p>
<h3 id="Complementary-Colors"><a href="#Complementary-Colors" class="headerlink" title="Complementary Colors"></a>Complementary Colors</h3><p>Usually, we define colors with an angle of 180° on the color wheel as complementary colors, which is commonly known as “contrasting colors”. Complementary colors have the largest range of hue changes, and the resulting picture color contrast is also the strongest, thus giving people a strong visual impact. But in art design, this also means “high risk”. Too strong a contrast can easily cause disharmony and overstimulation, and it is likely to “step on thunder”.</p>
<p>However, as long as it is properly grasped, “high risk will also bring high returns”, resulting in unexpected aesthetic innovation. Usually, complementary colors have extremely strong contrast and conflict. Therefore, the use of complementary color matching is generally more challenging. Usually, the method of changing the area ratio or saturation is used to present a better visual effect.</p>
<p>Blue and orange, yellow and purple are common complementary color combinations. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the costumes of the hero Kurumi have always been the focus of players’ attention. The blue and orange complementary colors used on the chest, sleeves, and waist seal of the Chengyun Lanshou (承云兰寿) have a finishing touch effect, and at the same time set off the lively and clever character image; Huiye Shaonu (辉烨少女) uses a large area of yellow and purple. Although it is also said to be beautiful by many players, it is not as outstanding as the former in terms of color contrast and complementary effect.</p>
<h3 id="Emphasis-Color-Matching"><a href="#Emphasis-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="Emphasis Color Matching"></a>Emphasis Color Matching</h3><p>We mentioned that the three elements of color are hue (i.e., tone), lightness, and chroma (i.e., saturation). In addition to choosing different hue combinations, you can also adjust the lightness and chroma of colors to further emphasize the color relationship.</p>
<p>Especially when the lightness or saturation of a large area of color blocks is low, the color purity of a small area of modules is high, which will naturally present a very advanced sense of contrast. In a low-purity background, especially when black, white, and gray are used as the background color, a small part of high-purity color will be particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>For example, the group of single-character posters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in the picture below has a black and gray overall background. The most eye-catching thing in the picture is the iconic symbolic items of each character, all of which are high-purity red, which directly and implicitly expresses the positioning and even related background of the character, such as the red Buddhist beads on Tsuchimikado’s wrist, the blindfold taken off by Viper Ning, and the red umbrella behind Kurumi. The art form fully reflects the implicitness of oriental narrative, creating a sense of mystery, and the visual performance is also very beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Color Matching"></a>3. The Role of Color Matching</h2><p>In addition to the intuitive visual performance that can be seen at a glance, color also has a strong psychological suggestion effect. In game design, it is also common to adjust colors to shape the appearance.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality"><a href="#Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality"></a>Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality</h3><p>By adjusting the hue combination, lightness, and chroma, objects with the same shape can present different effects. Generally speaking, the greater the color change, or the richer the level of change, the final expression of the appearance is also very different. This difference can be cleverly transformed into “rules” of different qualities in game design.</p>
<p>For example, the four pictures below are four costumes of the female character Justina Gu in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. From left to right, the quality and value in the game increase. We can see that in terms of overall color matching, these four sets of clothes are generally relatively close, all of which are white with a reddish-brown color scheme. The default skin on the far left uses red with light brown. The color change is small and soft, and the contrast is not very strong. The expressiveness is also the weakest, corresponding to the initial quality skin in the game that can be obtained for free. Compared with the first set, the second set has no difference in shape design. The only change is that the color of the neckline and skirt is changed to jujube red, and the contrast is stronger, and the quality is also improved by one level. In addition to the more complicated shape design, the combination of white, water red and golden brown in the third set also enhances the sense of color layering. The last set is a very popular Dragon Gate - Apsaras (龙门·飞天) collaboration skin. On the whole, its background color is also white, but the bright red streamer + full body gold embellishment gives this set of costumes a sense of dignity and refinement.</p>
<p>If you further observe these four sets of clothes, the quality increases from left to right. The lightness of the red color scheme of the second to fourth sets also has different “standards”. The relatively low-quality ones mostly use colors with low lightness, and the highest-quality ones use bright red with high lightness and chroma, and the material presents a golden luster.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships"><a href="#Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Color Shapes Spatial Relationships"></a>Color Shapes Spatial Relationships</h3><p>In reality, the presentation of colors will be affected by factors such as light and distance. For example, if there is extra lighting when taking portraits, the skin will appear whiter and more translucent. For example, when trying on clothes in a mall, there are often small spotlights in front of the dressing mirror, which is also to make the color of the clothes appear the most eye-catching effect.</p>
<p>In the game, the designer will use this feature in reverse, using the light and dark changes of colors to shape the spatial relationship of the scene. For example, in the scene in the picture, the rockery, stones, and trees on the right have higher color purity and are visually closer; the houses and trees in the distance have lower purity but higher brightness, and the color contrast is blurred, giving people a feeling of being illuminated by sunlight in the distance.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is a preliminary exploration of the use of color in game design. In many scenes where users are usually contacted, whenever a player is asked “Why do you like this game?”, many people will say without thinking that they are attracted by the exquisite graphics or unique art style of the game. Vision is the first impression many players have of a game, and then gradually goes deep into gameplay, genre, social interaction and other factors. Color plays a vital role in the “first impression”. By making good use of color matching, the design philosophy of game art can be better conveyed, and the success of commercialization can also be better assisted.</p>

    <title>Designing for the Real World Game Accessibility Features (Auditory)</title>
    <url>/2023/04/03/netease-ux-articles/news_20230510_28584_1087383/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087383.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For sighted people, even with the golden key of accessibility services, after actual operation, it is found that there are quite a few hurdles to overcome. It is even more difficult to imagine how blind people can happily play mobile games with us. Everyone jokes that poverty limits their imagination, but after seeing a set of real data, I found that my imagination is actually limited by prejudice.</p>
<p>According to the “Basic Situation Report of Visually Impaired Internet Users in China” released by the Secretariat of the China Information Accessibility Product Alliance (CAPA), there are 13 million visually impaired people in China (as of 2016), of which 91% are blind people of level one and two (as shown in the figure below). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F22cb6972-9b43-410a-adbf-609c6b3993ea.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Disability Level Ratio of 13 Million Visually Impaired People</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Among the visually impaired users surveyed, 92% use smartphones, of which 22% have used Internet software such as Didi, Kuaidi, and Uber to hail taxis, 33% have installed 11-20 applications on their mobile phones, and 83% can completely rely on screen reading functions when operating mobile phones and computers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F8d515964-5de7-40eb-957c-3b8ed52300d8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>What Visually Impaired People Usually Do Online on Their Mobile Phones</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the “2021 China Digital Inclusion User Survey Report” released in 2021, it can be seen that the completely blind group has a very high usage and dependence on smart products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe9c44f66-e0c0-4570-b993-a16ee3033a49.png/size/"></p>
<p>Combining the above two reports, we can see that 99% of completely blind people will use smartphones, and 54% of visually impaired people (91% of whom are blind) will use mobile phones to play games. So, facing the huge gaming needs of the visually impaired group, how to better solve the accessibility settings in the game has become one of the missions of game practitioners.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the gaming experience of the completely blind group, and introduce existing excellent game cases and analyze the methodology in three aspects: the auditory experience of the blind group, the guide design suitable for the blind group, and the game types suitable for the blind group.</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games"><a href="#1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?"></a>1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?</h2><h3 id="Sound-Design"><a href="#Sound-Design" class="headerlink" title="Sound Design"></a>Sound Design</h3><p>Sound is a very important part for blind players. We can get some clues from the existing few games specially designed for the blind: take the <em>Street Fighter</em> series as an example - every action, move, windup, and recovery will activate corresponding unique sounds.</p>
<p>First, the sounds are sorted and adjusted in a more detailed order of priority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F25d474f5-ad4a-4587-a532-b82bd3e84fc2.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Comparison of Different Sounds Visualized in the Game</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Games are not like movies. Movies will mix the sounds according to the process of the film during sound production, so that all sounds maintain the correct proportion. However, the game is completely dynamic, and all actions will change according to the player’s state. If the designer just puts the sound into the game, it must be a disaster.</p>
<p>Here, take FPS games as an example. The real situation is this: when the player shoots, he can hardly hear other sounds; but when the player’s walkie-talkie starts to speak, other sounds will become smaller to ensure that the player can hear his task goals clearly; and when an explosion occurs, other sounds will be covered up… All these arrangements can ensure the player’s pleasure in playing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F5eeb0bc5-4ae3-48eb-9e37-72a369340d83.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, when designing games for blind players, designers need to give priority to different sounds through early design, so that certain sounds “give way” to other sounds when they come out.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Emotional-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Sound Feedback"></a>Emotional Sound Feedback</h3><p>For example, in parkour games, the sense of pleasure is the power that constantly supports players to continue playing. At least on the sound level, it is necessary to extend the player’s excitement and freshness, and provide certain positive feedback.</p>
<p>Then a more classic design scheme is to judge the player’s current survival state and survival time through interactive music, and the music is switched and changed in real time to match the current game progress in terms of emotion; at the same time, the sound of a large number of coins or points picked up in the game becomes the pitch that matches the tonality of the background music - that is, the random pitch within the range of the scale where the music is currently located. In this way, when the player runs continuously and eats coins, he will play a melody line that belongs only to the player and does not conflict with the background music; for example, when you eat three coins in a row and trigger three notes, you will be eager to hear the appearance of the next note, and hope that this note will be “developed” and “resolved”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fed1bb0b0-fd54-4c02-8429-e4559df84557.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Subway Surfers》 Coin Sound Effect Schematic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This is completely in line with human psychology, and it also stimulates the player’s motivation to continue playing.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound feedback during some basic system interface operations needs to rely on the strong logic and rationality of the UI at all levels to support it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F066908c4-d22b-4f39-bd28-1d32551ca370.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Because it is necessary to use sound to establish the UI operation interface, it is more necessary to have a good operation flow. Out of consideration for the blind group, it is also very important to use sound to awaken the user’s curiosity in the functional interface. Currently, the types of sounds commonly used in functional interface operations are: music, sound effects, natural sounds, human voices, and so on. Another point is whether the arrangement of elements in the interface is upward, downward, leftward, or rightward. The position in the interface exists as an interesting variable, and is generally used to express the hierarchical structure between various information elements, and the information transmission and reading order on the screen (accessibility information reading function) between them, which can help developers sort the elements in turn. The more reasonable the design of the interface and process, the more it can empower the gaming experience of the blind group.</p>
<p>In addition, excellent plot can enhance the sense of substitution of the blind group, thereby activating the picture in the heart of the blind group.</p>
<p>Sound can create atmosphere and emotion. Through different sound styles and music, different game scenes and emotions can be created, allowing completely blind players to feel the theme, style, story and other elements of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fab3c3c18-ef00-42cb-8df0-fe70132d0d16.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Rich Gesture Sound Feedback"></a>Rich Gesture Sound Feedback</h3><p>In blind games, gesture commands are a commonly used interaction method, which can allow blind users to control the game through the touch screen, improving the operability and ease of use of the game. To make gesture commands play a better role in blind games, improvements can be made in the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design simple, easy-to-remember and intuitive gesture commands, avoiding commands that are too complex or easy to confuse.</li>
<li>Provide clear, definite and timely sound feedback so that the blind group knows which command they have executed and what effect it has produced.</li>
<li>Consider the different degrees of visual impairment of users and the adaptation problems of different types of devices, and provide multiple choices or custom options.</li>
<li>Conduct sufficient and continuous user testing and evaluation, and optimize and improve according to user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the built-in accessibility service of the iPhone binds rich gesture commands with unique sound feedback to form memory points, so as to better help the blind group to operate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F391368a4-bc68-4c7f-97b8-71b98b63abc8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without exquisite visual animation, and regardless of the design style of flatness and three-dimensionality, the focus of interaction falls on physical gestures. For example, the interactive operations performed by normal people on mobile phones, such as “single click to enter”, “long press and drag”, “slide to switch screens”, etc., are all redefined in the accessibility assistance mode. Blind people no longer need to rely on the physical buttons of the mobile phone to use various program services more deeply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fbdab9f6b-4fff-4eda-8d00-f169d837f9b8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Adding more gesture operations and corresponding sound feedback in the game can help the blind group deepen their memory of operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Good-Guidance"><a href="#2-Good-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Good Guidance"></a>2. Good Guidance</h2><p>In blind games, the role of good guidance is to help players familiarize themselves with the rules, goals, operations and environment of the game, improve players’ participation and satisfaction, and reduce frustration and abandonment.</p>
<h3 id="Guidance"><a href="#Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Guidance"></a>Guidance</h3><p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> provides an enhanced listening mode, which enhances the search for high-priority targets and plays corresponding prompt sounds to remind players. </p>

<p>In addition, the way to receive information should also be informed to the blind group in advance: sound can provide navigation and feedback. Through different sound effects and voice prompts, it can help completely blind players understand the game interface, operation methods, target locations, obstacles and other information, as well as the results of their actions and state changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fadd3ebdb-03e1-4437-9e01-adb26a32ace0.png/size/"></p>

<p>Instructions for wearing headphones are also very important, because the blind group will distinguish their operations and the situation they are in according to surround stereo or left and right channels. </p>

<p>Since blind games need to be supplemented by narration or prompt sounds for conventional operations, it is necessary to pay attention to the problem of “speech speed”. People with normal vision usually quickly obtain content and react by receiving visual information, but as a blind group that mainly obtains content through hearing, it is necessary to plan the “functional sound” in the game in advance and open the permission or function to adjust the speed of these sounds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fc0154312-cda2-434c-b9b2-7e0923e4f183.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Positioning"><a href="#Positioning" class="headerlink" title="Positioning"></a>Positioning</h3><p>In blind games, the sound design of positioning is very important, because it can help blind players perceive space and direction, and improve the playability and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Referenceable solutions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>At different positions, when the distance from the other party increases or decreases, frequency conversion processing is performed on the footsteps.</li>
<li>The methodology of echolocation is to use the characteristics of sound wave reflection and attenuation in space to simulate the position of the environment and the enemy. It needs to consider how to design sound sources of different types and intensities, and how to deal with echo effects and reverberation effects; it also needs to consider how to balance the relationship between sound and picture, avoiding audiovisual inconsistency or being too abstract.</li>
<li>Encode visual information into sound signals, so that the blind can perceive images through sound. Its core principle is to scan the image from left to right, map the horizontal direction to the time axis of the sound, map the vertical direction to the pitch of the sound, and map the brightness to the loudness of the sound. This forms an image-to-sound mapping, allowing the blind to hear the shape, size, color, position and other information of objects in the scene through headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: After the launch of <em>Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, in addition to the picture, some information of the character can also be judged by the change of sound alone. In the SFC version, with the help of dual-channel stereo output, if you control the character to walk from left to right, the footsteps of the character will also change accordingly, so that blind players can grasp the progress of the game through the change of sound.</p>
<p>In addition, the reading of maps and coordinates, and the detailed consideration of game special effects and dubbing are all important details from accessibility to improving the experience of the blind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fbd17cdba-39a2-402f-aadc-d58f6a145e11.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the game <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, echolocation technology is used. Players can scan new spaces to determine whether there are targets that need to be fought or items that need to be collected in the space. </p>

<p>When blind players hear different prompt sounds, they can also use the voice prompt dictionary to find the situation corresponding to the familiar prompt sound, so as to enhance memory and improve the response to the sound, and obtain a smoother game experience. </p>

<h2 id="3-Games-and-Gameplay-Suitable-for-the-Blind"><a href="#3-Games-and-Gameplay-Suitable-for-the-Blind" class="headerlink" title="3. Games and Gameplay Suitable for the Blind"></a>3. Games and Gameplay Suitable for the Blind</h2><p>For the types and gameplay of games that the blind group likes to play, we believe that the current blind game product types on the market mainly include fighting games, such as <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em>, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fde8aca9b-5fa4-43d6-93b5-43f5466970d4.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Fighting games are a very friendly game type for the blind group, because the game scene is relatively fixed and simple, and the movement range of the characters is also relatively simple. Secondly, these games make extensive use of audio to prompt different actions in the game, allowing the blind group to clearly understand the situation of the game. In the game <em>Street Fighter</em>, many blind players can reach high ranks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcec3b16f-a6a7-43bf-bd1a-3fd9d9754449.gif/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, there are casual games, card games, etc. In addition, there are “audio games” dominated by sound, which is a game type specially designed for the completely blind group. Like the game types mentioned above, they have quite excellent and complete sound effects and game dubbing.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Although so far, the number of games for the blind and other disabled people is still very small, and many of them are small games with relatively simple functions, from the color change system for color-blind players in the Japanese national mobile game <em>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</em> in the early years, to the NS version of <em>1-2-Switch</em> where blind players can play with normal people through the HD vibration function of the controller, and games with excellent sound effects such as the <em>Street Fighter</em> series, we have also seen more and more game developers making efforts in this area. As a blind player interviewed said:</p>
<p>“If you can play games like normal people, you can communicate with other people like normal people. I think games are a tool for communication. After all, it’s better to enjoy together than to enjoy alone.”</p>

    <title>Is the Supply in the Game Meeting Your Shopping Needs</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087389.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a game, player&#x2F;consumer churn is one of the most critical issues in its life cycle. Consumer churn refers to the situation where players who have a history of consumption in the game and whose cumulative consumption amount has reached a certain scale, but have not consumed for a recent period. Usually, this type of population overlaps with game churn users to a certain extent. When players churn from the game, they will naturally no longer have in-game consumption. In another case, players remain in the game, but churn in consumption. These players are often consumers that game manufacturers are very eager to retain, and are relatively easy to win back. The good news is that they are still interested in the game and are more likely to consume again than churned game players. The bad news is that the current supply in the game does not meet the needs of these players, resulting in player churn in consumption.</p>
<p>The reasons why players churn from the game are varied, such as dissatisfaction with the game’s character design, gameplay content, and other mechanisms, or the low input-output ratio during the cultivation process, or social and personal reasons. The recall of such players is often random. They may come back if the updated content of the game is attractive enough, or if they have looked around and there are no other games. Of course, we can also reach out through information channels to recall churned players, but in general, the effect of recall is limited without solving the fundamental problems. The purpose of analyzing and investigating such players is not only to win back these players, but also to mend the fold after the sheep are lost, find problems in time, and prevent other players from churning due to the same problems.</p>
<p>The reasons why players are still playing the game but no longer consuming are even more worthy of insight. We hope to hear their demands and understand how to keep them in the game.</p>
<h2 id="1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits"><a href="#1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits" class="headerlink" title="1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits"></a>1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits</h2><p>According to our research, different players have different consumption habits and game goals in the game, and their consumption needs will also vary. An overly simple or “taken for granted” supply structure obviously cannot satisfy the consumption experience of various players.</p>
<p>In terms of players’ consumption habits, the same game will include various consumption habits such as daily micro-transactions, large-scale transactions at key points, and on-demand transactions. The first two forms have a large player base and overlap. According to the research results, we classify the props mentioned by players in their self-reports. Overall, the consumption content in the game can be divided into basic consumables, scarce props, and decorative props (clothing, skins, etc.). Among them, basic consumables are often low-priced props that meet the basic clearance needs of the game. For example, props that obtain the number of game challenges or game duration, cheap props that are consumed a lot in basic enhancement or other basic game experiences; while scarce props are props that players need when they deeply experience the game and have high requirements for the attributes of characters or weapons. Generally, they are expensive and limited in supply.</p>
<p>The consumption habit of daily micro-transactions usually corresponds to basic consumables and a very small number of scarce props. For example, players purchase basic commodities such as game passes and weekly cards, and immediately purchase a small number of specific props or daily&#x2F;weekly gift packs containing the props according to immediate card draw and dress-up needs. The consumption of such players is basically used to meet the basic needs of the game. Without the stimulation of deep needs, the consumption amount will not change much. It is enough to retain and maintain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0f87a0e7-7ef0-401e-95b4-a0522e3756ea.png/size/"></p>
<p>The consumption habit of large-scale transactions at key points usually corresponds to the “stockpiling” of scarce props. For example, players specifically wait for activity nodes such as anniversaries, festivals, and new seasons to purchase the required props in large quantities at discounted prices, but they will not purchase them at the original price at ordinary times. Players who make large-scale transactions at key points are likely to exhibit “consumption churn” characteristics multiple times in their consumption life cycle. There are two reasons. First, players who make large-scale transactions at activity nodes have certain considerations for cost performance, and often use the “lowest discount” that has appeared in the game as a standard to measure whether they should buy; second, when the “stockpiling” is not used up, there will be no consumption of the same props at the next discount node.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the consumption frequency of players who make large-scale transactions at key points, one is to maintain a relatively stable node discount system and be cautious about breaking prices. Every price break will raise players’ psychological expectations for discounts and increase players’ dissatisfaction and wait-and-see attitude towards subsequent node discounts; the other is to pay attention to the activity cycle of each prop, and avoid two consecutive waves of activities focusing on the same prop, so as to reduce the situation where the consumption frequency decreases due to inventory. In addition, players who make large-scale transactions at key points are more concerned about the cost-effectiveness of consumption relative to the total consumption price. They adopt a pricing system of “increasing discounts with increasing consumption”, such as activities like “x% off for purchases over xx”.</p>
<p>Players who make on-demand transactions are usually “not short of money” and buy as they wish. For scarce props that can be bought daily, they do not wait for activities and do not consider cost-effectiveness much. They buy immediately when they need them. Such players have low price sensitivity. Under the condition of ensuring game balance and mechanics, there will be consumption if there is supply. After all, in most game designs, the scarcity of scarce props is extremely serious.</p>
<p>And according to the research results, it is speculated that the reasonable and small increase in daily supply will not affect the sales of large-scale transactions at key points. First, scarce props are always scarce resources under a reasonable supply system, and will not cause stockpiling at key points due to a small increase in daily supply. Second, the overlap between players who make on-demand transactions daily and players who wait for discount nodes is limited. The two systems do not have a high degree of competition and exclusivity.</p>
<h2 id="2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings"><a href="#2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings"></a>2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings</h2><p>In terms of consumption mechanisms, the two strategies currently commonly used in games are bundled sales and probability consumption. For example, bundled sales include combining different props and providing discounted gift packs and bundles; probability consumption includes various forms such as card draw, loot boxes, and probability enhancement. Player feedback on both mechanisms is very controversial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fa7e6e292-6fbe-4843-991a-17d90e363018.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Bundled-Sales"><a href="#Bundled-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Bundled Sales"></a>Bundled Sales</h3><p>Bundled sales include three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted purchase:</strong> When consumers purchase product A, they can purchase product B at a price lower than the market price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified price sale:</strong> Product A and product B are not priced separately, but are sold at a bundled unified price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified packaging sale:</strong> Product A and product B are sold in a unified package.</li>
</ul>
<p>The binding and mandatory nature of the three forms increase in turn. An important condition for unified price sales and unified packaging bundled sales is the complementarity between products. For example, the bundling of a set of fashion, or the bundling of various props required for a certain task. The complementarity between these products is strong enough, and bundled sales are a win-win situation for game revenue and player experience. However, it is counterproductive to adopt or bundle products that are not complementary or even have no complementarity.</p>
<p>In our research, players often give feedback that they are not satisfied with the content of the gift pack. Even for the same gift pack, the parts that different players are not satisfied with are also different. The gift pack content that this player thinks is redundant and a waste of money may be the reason why another player buys the gift pack. And this separation also shows that the bundling of this kind of gift pack has failed. Not only is there no complementarity between the different contents of the gift pack, but the target users are also too different. It is not recommended to adopt the strong binding method of unified price sale or unified packaging sale for this kind of combination. It is more suitable for the bundling method of discounted purchase, giving consumers the freedom to choose. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F1395ab05-de51-441f-8906-ece0369e9d43.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Probability-Consumption"><a href="#Probability-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="Probability Consumption"></a>Probability Consumption</h3><p>According to expected utility theory, players’ satisfaction with probability consumption is related to their personal risk utility function. In economics and finance, the risk preferences of market participants are divided into three categories: risk averse, risk neutral, and risk appetite, and it is believed that most people are risk-averse.</p>
<p>The utility function of risk averters is strictly concave, as shown in the figure below, U(E(W)) &gt; E(U(W)). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F371e25cb-e0bf-44fc-b4e6-69a3a8ba8227.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, when there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get 50 yuan</li>
<li>50% chance of getting 0 yuan, 50% chance of getting 100 yuan</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the average return is the same, risk averters will prefer “certain 50 yuan” rather than the risky option, that is, “the utility of 50 yuan” is greater than “the average of the utility of 0 yuan and the utility of 100 yuan”. The utility of the latter is only equivalent to “the income brought by certain CE (for example, 40 yuan)”.</p>
<p>According to the decision weight function of prospect theory, the decision weight of small probability events will be higher, which explains why people buy lottery tickets and are willing to draw prizes in the game for the small probability of winning the jackpot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe46d0d77-0948-41b5-b0ab-234ee927c81b.png/size/"></p>
<p>RP in the figure is the risk premium, that is, the difference between the determined income and the income from taking risks, which is the compensation required by investors for taking risks themselves. For risk averters, in the face of probability consumption such as lottery, probability enhancement, etc., in order to obtain the best or successful enhancement, the amount of probability consumption they are willing to pay will be less than their inner pricing of the target, and the difference is the risk premium.</p>
<p>Therefore, players will complain more during probability consumption: only when “the pricing of the drawing result” ≥ “the amount of probability consumption + risk premium” can it be possible to bring better psychological benefits than certain consumption. This also shows that the pricing of the guaranteed goods in the guarantee mechanism of probability consumption, or the expected price of consumers, needs to match “the amount of consumption + risk premium” in order to bring a satisfactory consumption experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players’ consumption habits are different, and they are accompanied by differences in consumption timing, types of consumed props, and consumption amount. Based on this, the supply quantity and rhythm of game props need to be reconsidered to further meet consumer demand. In terms of sales strategies, although bundled sales and probability consumption have become widely used methods in games, through consumer feedback and related theoretical research, from the perspective of optimizing consumer experience, the application of the two methods still has shortcomings. Bundled sales can be improved through simple and effective improvement methods, while the optimization method of probability consumption still needs further research and investigation.</p>

    <title>A Psychological Perspective on Game Review Sections</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087395.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Today, online reviews are an important channel for consumers to obtain product information, and their importance is even increasing. As the “trendsetters” of the Internet, game players are also active in major game review lists, forums, official Weibo accounts, super topics… Their comments on the game are a manifestation of the game’s reputation, and will become a reference for other players and even affect whether new players are willing to try it out.</p>
<p>When a player wants to see game-related news, they may go to TapTap to see the ratings, they may go to Weibo to see the hot topics, they may go to Tieba to see the guides, or they may go to the official account to see related news… What kind of impact do these TapTap ratings, comments under Weibo posts, and posts in Tieba have on viewers? This article starts from a psychological perspective, combining some psychological theories and examples to explain the interesting phenomena in the game review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fd56d36ae-ad72-48f6-85ee-18b60366fa25.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words"><a href="#1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words" class="headerlink" title="1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?"></a>1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?</h2><p>Pictures and text are two main forms of reviews. People usually think that pictures are more convincing than text, the so-called “no picture, no truth”, but in the game field, are picture reviews also more effective than text reviews?</p>
<p>When players read reviews, it is actually a process of receiving, processing, and interpreting information. In psychology, there is a dual processing theory of widely disseminated information that can explain this process. This theory describes that in the process of information processing and decision-making, there are two independent but mutually influencing systems - the analytical system and the experiential system. The analytical system is biased towards the ideal, and requires relatively large cognitive resources to integrate information, and the process is relatively slow; while the experiential system is fast and relatively superficial.</p>
<p>After understanding the information processing process, let’s look at picture reviews and text reviews. For everyone, pictures are more concrete and intuitive than text. We can see the prominent content from the picture at a glance; while text can describe more essential information, but it requires a certain amount of reading and time to understand, and is more abstract than pictures.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific content, under the influence of the characteristics of different types of reviews, pictures can relatively activate the players’ experiential system, while text can activate the players’ analytical system. In this case, games, as a hedonic sensory product, picture reviews can provide some specific and intuitive player feelings, matching the fast experiential system processing path. Therefore, in the game review section, picture reviews are often more likely to influence players’ emotions than text reviews, that is, they are more effective. If the game is not a hedonic and sensory product, but a practical product, then text reviews are more useful than a “fancy” picture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ff17368ef-a770-4bae-a98b-1269b1aece40.png/size/"></p>
<p>Of course, the real review section will not be like a psychology laboratory, with only single text reviews or picture reviews. There are also many content with both pictures and text, and then there will be a superimposed effect.</p>
<h2 id="2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews"><a href="#2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews"></a>2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews</h2><p>A review may be positive and complimentary, or it may be negative, critical, or even “flaming”. In psychology, the positive and negative and neutral aspects of a review are collectively referred to as “review valence.”</p>
<p>As everyone should know, positive reviews have a positive effect, and negative reviews will bring negative impressions and dissemination power, and the negative impact of negative reviews is higher than the impact of positive reviews. You can imagine whether a one-star negative review on TapTap has a much greater impact than a five-star positive review.</p>
<p>But for games, this special product, it is not difficult to find that in places like Tieba and forums, negative and neutral reviews are far more numerous than positive reviews, and this is mostly the case for games. In this case, the review section seems to cause a huge blow to the game. But in fact, we need to understand that behind these negative reviews are players with poor gaming experiences. Compared to players with more positive gaming experiences, they are more willing to speak out and express their “unhappiness”, on the one hand, to seek resonance, on the other hand, they also hope that the game official can improve these bad experiences in time; in addition, many psychology scholars have found through research that the effect of review valence is an inverted U-shaped curve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fc7e6933f-54bf-42af-b22f-ff21b44c0942.png/size/"></p>
<p>The so-called inverted U-shaped curve describes that when people see reviews that are biased towards negative, they may have negative views on the product, but as more and more negative information appears and the degree becomes deeper, people’s trust in the reviews begins to rise and then declines. That is, compared with people’s extreme reviews, everyone is more inclined to believe in moderate review valence.</p>
<p>In addition to the content described by the review itself, the characteristics of the person viewing and reading the review will also have a great impact. This article briefly cites one example: the player’s own regulatory focus level. Regulatory focus level is a self-regulation process of people, divided into promotion focus and prevention focus. Promotion-focused players focus on growth, pay attention to positive results and magnify them, commonly speaking, they are more optimistic, and see more of “what can be gained”; while prevention-focused players focus on “what they will lose”, and strive to minimize their negative results.</p>
<p>To give a common example, a player draws a prize in the game, and the probability of winning is 80%. A promotion-focused player will feel that their probability of winning is very close to 100%, and it seems to be within easy reach, eager to try; while a prevention-focused player believes that they have a 20% chance of not getting it, and they are concerned about what they might lose.</p>
<p>Observing the relationship between the player’s own regulatory focus level and review valence, it is not difficult to find that for promotion-focused players, positive reviews are more useful than negative reviews, and they pay more attention to the positive gains in the reviews; while for prevention-focused players, negative reviews have a greater impact than positive reviews.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Official Responses"></a>3. The Role of Official Responses</h2><p>When we look at the review sections of some games, we often find a phenomenon, that is, the official “picks” or replies. In addition to the transmission of information itself, these replies actually have other effects.</p>
<p>Official replies have a positive effect on users. Let’s not talk about the specific content of the reply, but the behavior itself has a positive impact - research shows that in terms of the game development team directly facing the voices of players, direct interaction with everyone and collecting suggestions is a manifestation of the developer’s operation plan. A high reply rate reflects the official’s good operation planning and attitude to a certain extent. In games, the active response of the official shows that the development team attaches great importance to the suggestions of players, pays attention to everyone’s feedback and the status of the game, and also helps potential “cloud players” get to know the official and reduce the perceived negative risks. Some players even call for replies from the official in the review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fd7b0e7b7-7122-493e-825a-36319208caf3.png/size/"></p>
<p>So, how should game developers reply to players in order to achieve better results? This is related to the persona, the timeliness of the reply, and the specific form of the review.</p>
<p>First, you can consider positioning a specific persona. Why have a persona? For players, most development teams are far away from them. Even if the developers feel that they are listening to what players say most of the time and use it as a basis for changes, many players still don’t notice. When trying to communicate with players, targeted replies can indeed close this distance, but replies from the cold “xxx development team” and “xxx planner” are not obvious in closing the distance. If a clear persona can be established, especially one that is combined with the game’s own mechanics, worldview, characters, etc., it can have a better effect in closing the distance, easing the atmosphere, and operating the community. The cute loli of two-dimensional games, the female priest in the Western medieval background, the commander of FPS or military games, the injured companion of the doomsday survival game, etc., are all specific personas brewed by game developers under this strategy.</p>
<p>The second is the timeliness of the reply. Diagnostic theory refers to the process by which people judge the importance of a piece of information to themselves when they come into contact with it. Therefore, when information with high diagnostic value appears, people will immediately be attracted by this information and use it to help them make judgments. The official reply is diagnostic information in the entire review process, and the faster the official reply speed, the more it can grasp the player’s psychology in time, reflecting the high efficiency of the producer and the importance attached to the player. For example, the timely response of the game <em>UNO!</em> on TapTap reflects the players’ love for the official’s timely response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F2da6cf05-a38b-41d4-bac3-de96eed32eee.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F81d0369a-f88f-4180-a54a-9746afd884ba.png/size/"></p>
<p>How the producer replies to the player is also related to the specific form of the review. In the game’s review section, we will see some negative reviews. In response to these negative reviews, is it better to “admit mistakes” and reply “will improve”, or to analyze the reasons for the player’s negative experience with the player? This is actually related to whether the player’s evaluation is emotional or attribute-based.</p>
<p>Emotional evaluation refers to the player’s overall evaluation is relatively subjective, without the support of various examples, such as “so bad”, “don’t like” and other replies full of emotional words. At this time, if the official reply “admits mistakes”, apologizes and promises to improve, the player will further attribute the responsibility of the problem to the producer itself, and think that the official is perfunctory to him&#x2F;her. At this time, a “defensive” reply will be more useful, such as appropriately introducing the better aspects of the game to the player, reducing the player’s bad attribution to the game itself; while attribute-based evaluation is relatively objective compared to emotional evaluation, and will describe specific problems. At this time, a reply of “admitting mistakes” is more useful, supplemented by specific improvement plans may make players feel the sincerity of the official.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>This article mainly introduces the form of reviews, positive and negative valence, and some content of official replies, and discusses them in conjunction with relevant psychological theories. In fact, there are many more interesting phenomena in the review section, and the degree of influence of reviews on players is also different. Paying attention to the review section can help user researchers and development teams better understand players’ thoughts and needs, and explore the possibility of attracting new players.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087397.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Game loading design has undergone iterations and innovations along with the development of the game industry. It can even be cleverly designed in combination with game style and story, bringing players a better sense of immersion and a more interesting gaming experience. This article will introduce the development path of game loading, focus on the design methods of game loading, and analyze the design art of game loading from the two aspects of strong perception and weak perception of game loading.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Path-of-Development-From-Appearance-to-Elimination"><a href="#1-The-Path-of-Development-From-Appearance-to-Elimination" class="headerlink" title="1. The Path of Development: From Appearance to Elimination"></a>1. The Path of Development: From Appearance to Elimination</h2><h3 id="The-Original-Meaning-“Reducing-Anxiety”"><a href="#The-Original-Meaning-“Reducing-Anxiety”" class="headerlink" title="The Original Meaning - “Reducing Anxiety”"></a>The Original Meaning - “Reducing Anxiety”</h3><p>Looking back on the time when playing Famicom games, you will find that you don’t seem to have any memory of the game loading screen. This is because the game capacity at that time was small, the storage medium was a cartridge, and the reading speed was fast. The game could basically run without loading.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the storage medium for games became magnetic tape. The popular game equipment was a home computer equipped with an 8-bit microprocessor and 64k of memory. The computer read data according to the rotation of the magnetic tape. The loading time of more than ten minutes would inevitably lead to misunderstanding and anxiety about “computer crashed?” if only a black screen was displayed to the player. So the text loading prompt appeared, but this simple transition from static to dynamic form could only barely pass the boring time of loading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0360da6b-d251-43ec-8b94-ce4fb50083ac.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Compared with the monotonous text prompts, many games chose to use original paintings as loading screens to help players pass the time. For the art resources that were suppressed by program restrictions at that time, this was a rare opportunity for “high-definition” display. Although the loading time was extended by 10% due to the call of art materials, this also became a rare opportunity for players to see “high-definition” pictures, so it was very popular. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcd8931bf-1683-438c-8832-3ee073ac1316.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Game Screen (left) and Loading Screen (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>By the end of the 1980s, progress bars had already begun to be used in games. Although the first game to design a progress bar is no longer testable, this design that can intuitively reduce the player’s waiting anxiety is still not outdated.</p>
<h3 id="Pioneering-Design-“Game-in-Game”"><a href="#Pioneering-Design-“Game-in-Game”" class="headerlink" title="Pioneering Design - “Game in Game”"></a>Pioneering Design - “Game in Game”</h3><p>With the upgrade of software and hardware, the game reading speed is faster. In Namco’s <em>Ridge Racer</em> in 1993, the game changed the previous loading form and placed the playable mini-game <em>Galaxian</em> in it, making the 30-second loading time pass abnormally fast, and the response in the player community was very good. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0eb88cdd-42e5-40dd-beea-ee425a7b852d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Loading game “Galaxian” in “Ridge Racer”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Although Namco applied for a patent for the mini-game in the loading process - “auxiliary game”, which created a shackle for its creation, the mini-game in this patent and the main game are two separate games. Later generations cleverly avoided this point and loaded part of the main game code to make it a mini-game. Part of the main game content was migrated and designed into an interactive game loading, which achieved the design of “game in game” and also made the way of game loading enter a more distinctive new stage.</p>
<h3 id="Unremitting-Pursuit-“Eliminate”-Loading"><a href="#Unremitting-Pursuit-“Eliminate”-Loading" class="headerlink" title="Unremitting Pursuit - “Eliminate” Loading"></a>Unremitting Pursuit - “Eliminate” Loading</h3><p>Whether it is a static prompt, a dynamic picture, or an interactive mini-game, these are just to distract the player’s attention. However, the player knows that it is loading, and the game experience is inevitably affected. “Elimination” is the optimal solution that does not affect the game experience and concentration, and this is also the unremitting pursuit of many game loading designs.</p>
<p>In 2005, <em>Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland</em> directly used the no-loading screen as a selling point of the game, and players could experience the thrill of seamless exploration. It connects the game map through passages. When players enter the enclosed space of the passage, the map is loaded, allowing players to complete the loading unknowingly while experiencing the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0737e675-bc3b-419e-b097-326794ca977f.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-A-Thousand-Producers-Have-a-Thousand-Loading-Design-Methods"><a href="#2-A-Thousand-Producers-Have-a-Thousand-Loading-Design-Methods" class="headerlink" title="2. A Thousand Producers Have a Thousand Loading Design Methods"></a>2. A Thousand Producers Have a Thousand Loading Design Methods</h2><p>The player experience in the game will inevitably be affected by memory reading, network speed, and response speed. Players often cannot get the feedback they want immediately after operating, and always have to wait for a while.</p>
<p>The Doherty Threshold theory points out that when the user’s command is executed by the system and the answer is returned within 400 milliseconds, it can keep them focused, improve productivity, and improve the negative experience of waiting. Extending the Doherty Threshold theory to the application of game loading design methods, it can be found that giving players timely feedback during game loading and the perceptibility of the waiting feedback process can maintain the player’s concentration and provide a good game experience.</p>
<p>The strong perception of game loading emphasizes the visualization of the feedback loading process and clarifies the waiting progress. The weak perception of the game loading process emphasizes the timeliness of feedback, so that players are unconsciously in the process of waiting.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Loading-Design-with-Strong-Perception"><a href="#Game-Loading-Design-with-Strong-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Game Loading Design with Strong Perception"></a>Game Loading Design with Strong Perception</h3><p>In the game loading design that players can clearly perceive, regardless of its accuracy, the visual form can well reduce their waiting anxiety. The flexible use of loading animations, progress bars, splash pages, and art resources are commonly used design methods.</p>
<p>● <strong>Progress Bar</strong></p>
<p>Animation is a good way to attract players visually, and the progress bar is the best form of waiting time visualization. The progress bar can be designed in combination with elements that reflect acceleration, connection, etc. in the game, and with meaningful animation effects, it can give more vitality to the functional loading form. For example, in <em>Onmyoji</em>, the loading progress bar is displayed by the Shikigami Usagi, who has the attribute of accelerating assistance, riding a magic frog and jumping forward, which is interesting and vivid and has the meaning of the game world view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ffb69fcf5-e551-49d8-a58b-d0b6ed4fc062.gif/size/"></p>
<p>● <strong>Splash Page</strong></p>
<p>The splash page can not only bring a unique transition effect, but also has a fascinating guiding effect. Common forms include opening doors, closing fans, turning pages, notes, and so on. In <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the splash screen and fading animation are combined with black and white photos of the scenery, which directly brings people’s thoughts into the western world of the twentieth century. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp"><a href="#nbsp" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F950eb662-ca7b-43cd-aca7-ca7e44ec5867.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“Red-Dead-Redemption”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“Red-Dead-Redemption”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “Red Dead Redemption”"></a><em>Loading display of “Red Dead Redemption”</em></h2><p>● <strong>Art Resources</strong></p>
<p>Art resources are also the most commonly used content for showing off skills in game loading, which can increase players’ perceived value of the game style and establish their trust in the game. For example, the exquisite original paintings allow players to appreciate the exquisite production of game art, and also bring players a relaxed and pleasant waiting experience; the display of game models during loading, and even some free interactions, can bring players a unique experience different from the rhythm of the game. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F62dd7e53-537b-4ebd-a42a-8ce2d49df667.png/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“The-Elder-Scrolls-V”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“The-Elder-Scrolls-V”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “The Elder Scrolls V”"></a><em>Loading display of “The Elder Scrolls V”</em></h2><p>The loading form of excellent art resources can also help the connection of the game plot. For example, the loading screen of <em>The Witcher 3</em> is a plot introduction, which helps players recall the main line and also brings a movie-level look and feel. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-2"><a href="#nbsp-2" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ff6973e83-3dfd-4592-939e-2009b6f58d86.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“The-Witcher-3”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“The-Witcher-3”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “The Witcher 3”"></a><em>Loading display of “The Witcher 3”</em></h2><h3 id="Game-Loading-Design-with-Weak-Perception"><a href="#Game-Loading-Design-with-Weak-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Game Loading Design with Weak Perception"></a>Game Loading Design with Weak Perception</h3><p>The goal of weakly perceived loading design is to allow players to spend the game loading time unknowingly, by cleverly using “blinders” to naturally turn the loading screen into a part of the game.</p>
<p>● <strong>Passage</strong></p>
<p>In the game’s elevators, cable cars, or winding aisles, the player’s forward speed will be limited, thus giving the game ample loading time. The design of the passage is widely used in the game loading design of weak perception. For example, there are always many elevators in Hidetaka Miyazaki’s games, and the game completes the loading of switching scene resources while the player is riding the elevator. In Souls-like games, two large scenes are usually connected by a narrow cave or an empty dungeon, hiding the loading process outside the narrow space. In <em>God of War III</em>, players control the characters to fly in the tunnel to avoid falling rocks, perfectly combining the passage with interactive loading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcfc9521f-9f2d-446b-aaa0-7a8f8fa4bffb.gif/size/"></p>
<p>● <strong>Slow Walking</strong></p>
<p>Slow walking is a loading form that is more difficult for players to detect. The slowed footsteps before entering the plot, and even when the game is preloading subsequent resources, in order to prevent the player from walking too fast, there will be settings such as swamps, narrow gaps that can only be passed slowly, or deliberately tripping the character, etc. to delay time for loading. These are the means used by the production team to use actions and terrain to make the game loading and game content more naturally connected. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-3"><a href="#nbsp-3" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fa7d081ee-cd11-4685-8a0b-94d0c8bf0ba9.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Slow-walking-loading-of-“God-of-War-4”"><a href="#Slow-walking-loading-of-“God-of-War-4”" class="headerlink" title="Slow walking loading of “God of War 4”"></a><em>Slow walking loading of “God of War 4”</em></h2><p>● <strong>Camera Movement</strong></p>
<p>In fact, it is not difficult to perfectly hide the loading process in the game. The game only needs to limit the player’s perspective through the camera to easily hide the loading process from view. As early as the PS1 era, there were applications of using the camera to cover up loading, such as in <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, as Spyro flies, the game perspective changes from the ground to the sky, hiding the loading process of ground resources. In <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, the close-up shot is used to express the heroine’s inner activities and follow her perspective to complete the scene switching. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-4"><a href="#nbsp-4" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F41434d85-67ce-483b-9c50-8aba735c4208.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Close-up-loading-in-“Hellblade-Senua’s-Sacrifice”"><a href="#Close-up-loading-in-“Hellblade-Senua’s-Sacrifice”" class="headerlink" title="Close-up loading in “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”"></a><em>Close-up loading in “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”</em></h2><h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Today, the design of game loading is not limited to specific routines or blindly hiding. Instead, it is constantly exploring the perfect integration of game loading with game content and worldview. More and more games are carefully designed between maps, and even no trace of loading can be seen.</p>
<p>Due to the technical development of memory reading speed, the current game loading process cannot be truly eliminated. While technology is sprinting forward to accelerate loading, the content design of game loading has become an art. It can be cleverly designed in combination with the game style and story narration, which can not only help the game improve the worldview, but also optimize the user experience, increase retention, and bring players a better sense of immersion and a more interesting gaming experience.</p>

    <title>Fault-Tolerant Design in Games How to Apply Postel&#39;s Law</title>
    <url>/2023/06/23/netease-ux-articles/news_20230628_28584_1095677/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230628/28584_1095677.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just like the Roman god Janus (and many politicians), every Web application has two faces: its ‘human face’ interacts with people, and the machine face interacts with computer systems.” —— “Your Website has Two Faces” by Lyle Mullican</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human thinking is different from that of machines. Human understanding of information is fuzzy, variable, and broad, while machines can only recognize data that conforms to a specific structure. How can the two understand each other and achieve a balance between input and output? This requires certain fault-tolerant design, so that the product can use “two faces” to interact with people and machines, respectively. This article will introduce the theoretical basis behind this - Postel’s Law, and introduce its application in game fault-tolerant design with examples.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Postel’s-Law"><a href="#1-What-is-Postel’s-Law" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Postel’s Law?"></a>1. What is Postel’s Law?</h2><p>First, let’s understand the content and origin of Postel’s Law. Postel’s Law (Robustness Principle) is also known as the robustness principle. In 1980, computer scientist Jonathan Bruce Postel released an early specification of the TCP protocol. In the specification, he proposed this law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Be conservative in what you send” means that the product should abide by certain specifications when displaying content to users; “be liberal in what you accept” means that when receiving user input, non-standard input should be allowed. The core idea it expresses is: the product should have a certain fault tolerance. This has become a design guide in the computer field, and has been widely used in game interaction&#x2F;user experience design.</p>
<h2 id="2-Allow-Diversity-Tolerate-Errors-and-Exceptions"><a href="#2-Allow-Diversity-Tolerate-Errors-and-Exceptions" class="headerlink" title="2. Allow Diversity, Tolerate Errors and Exceptions"></a>2. Allow Diversity, Tolerate Errors and Exceptions</h2><p>When designing a game system, we cannot only allow players to enter the format that the machine can recognize, but also consider the diversity of users, accept and adapt to more flexible and diverse input and operations, and design corresponding processing methods.</p>
<h3 id="Allow-Players-to-Perform-Arbitrary-Operations"><a href="#Allow-Players-to-Perform-Arbitrary-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Allow Players to Perform Arbitrary Operations"></a>Allow Players to Perform Arbitrary Operations</h3><p>We may have had this experience. Sometimes, when we enter incorrect text or ambiguous content in the search box, the software can still give the desired search results, as if it has “figured out” our thoughts. In this process, the program does not limit input when facing the user. Even if the content is wrong or invalid, it will not crash or report an error. Instead, it will process the input content autonomously after receiving the input, showing a high degree of tolerance. We don’t need to delve into the program implementation behind this, we just need to know that this is in line with Postel’s Law.</p>
<p>The nickname box in <em>Elden Ring</em> also handles the input of spaces in a similar way. Players can enter spaces at will without any error prompts. But when the confirm button is pressed, the program will automatically process the content, delete the spaces at the beginning and end, and the extra spaces in the middle, so that the nickname becomes a format that conforms to the rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F246be872-95b7-4eb5-bb6e-9edbf587b7aa.gif/size/"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Input-Method-Adaptation"><a href="#Input-Method-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Input Method Adaptation"></a>Input Method Adaptation</h3><p>Games have a variety of input methods. Taking computer games as an example, the input methods can be a controller or keyboard and mouse. Many games can recognize these different input methods and give corresponding responses, so that they can tolerate and meet the different operating needs of players.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has adaptively processed the input method: when no controller is connected, it will default that the player is using keyboard and mouse operations, and the interface will also display keyboard and mouse prompts; when the player connects a controller, the game will automatically recognize and switch the operation mode to controller operation, and the interface prompts will also become controller icons accordingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fb18e459e-cfbc-4710-abe1-a200a4631fd2.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Input Method Adaptation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Output-Method-Adaptation"><a href="#Output-Method-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Output Method Adaptation"></a>Output Method Adaptation</h3><p>Game products are usually not limited to running on one platform or one system. We need to adapt to screen resolutions, device types, and operating systems to reduce the impact of different device conditions on interface effects and operating experience. Taking <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, in addition to running on various mobile phones, it can also be played through an emulator. When we drag the interface to change to any size, we can see that the interface layout and component positions are automatically adjusted, and the interface can always maintain a reasonable and clear presentation effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F1d8d254c-23d5-4d86-bb20-fa53ce77663d.gif/size/"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Exception-Handling"><a href="#Exception-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Exception Handling"></a>Exception Handling</h3><p>Various abnormal situations such as network delay and disconnection may occur during the game running process, which is difficult to avoid. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider in advance and design the processing method when developing the game, which can prevent problems such as process loss and data damage caused by abnormal situations. Disconnect protection and reconnection, automatic saving and other functions are common exception handling methods:</p>
<p>If the controller is disconnected during the game process of <em>Dead Cells</em>, a “Controller Disconnected” prompt will pop up and the game will be automatically paused to avoid the character being out of control and affecting the game process. If the controller is reconnected, the prompt will disappear and the game will automatically resume. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fc50ec2e4-4500-4946-ab69-d43376e31f24.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Dead Cells》 Controller Disconnection and Reconnection Handling</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, players can manually save the game, and the system also automatically saves frequently (there will be an icon prompt on the interface when saving). If you encounter a special situation during the game and don’t have time to save manually, don’t worry, you can find these automatic saves in the loading game interface, which largely avoids the loss of game progress&#x2F;archive damage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F78a0c6ff-1281-485e-aa37-e96a88dfefac.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Define-Actionable-Boundaries"><a href="#3-Define-Actionable-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="3. Define Actionable Boundaries"></a>3. Define Actionable Boundaries</h2><p>Although we can use the game’s own inclusive design to accept various behaviors of players as much as possible, sometimes we still don’t want various strange operations to occur. This requires setting some boundaries to properly guide players and reduce the possibility of incorrect input.</p>
<h3 id="Clear-Definition-Instructions"><a href="#Clear-Definition-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Clear Definition Instructions"></a>Clear Definition Instructions</h3><p>We can tell players the boundaries of operation by directly writing down the rules, so that players can autonomously filter out some wrong input situations. This method is more common in the interface for entering nicknames. The rules for nicknames are often more complicated, involving character type restrictions, character length restrictions, space processing, etc., and various input situations may occur. Different games also have different requirements for nicknames. Appropriately marking some rules will make it more convenient for players to enter content that meets the requirements.</p>
<h3 id="Limited-Options"><a href="#Limited-Options" class="headerlink" title="Limited Options"></a>Limited Options</h3><p>We can limit the operation by reducing the freedom of input components and filtering out some options outside the boundary. For example, in the trading house of <em>Revelation M</em>, the value of “Purchase Quantity” requires players to enter pure numbers. When clicking on a number to enter, the system will force the numeric keyboard to pop up, avoiding the situation where players enter other characters. </p>

<h3 id="Condition-Constraints"><a href="#Condition-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Condition Constraints"></a>Condition Constraints</h3><p>Condition constraints are a commonly used design method in Metroidvania-like games. There are often some places on the map that cannot be reached in the early stage, and you need to obtain a certain ability or some props to explore. Through the gradual unlocking of various conditions, players can be guided to play according to the design expectations, enjoy the fun of constantly discovering new content, and also make the growth of the character and the rhythm of the game reach a relatively stable state.</p>
<p>At the exit of the novice map of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, this design is made. A bug is arranged to block the way. Players need to learn spell skills to pass, prompting them to return to explore other paths and improve their character abilities. It also prevents players from accidentally breaking into the late-game map in the early stage. </p>

<h2 id="4-Operation-Feedback-and-Correction"><a href="#4-Operation-Feedback-and-Correction" class="headerlink" title="4. Operation Feedback and Correction"></a>4. Operation Feedback and Correction</h2><p>Defining boundaries can only prompt players what kind of operation is appropriate to a certain extent, but players can still perform some operations outside the boundary. Therefore, when players take incorrect or risky operations, they can also give some feedback or remedial measures to help players correct their operations autonomously.</p>
<h3 id="Information-Prompts"><a href="#Information-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="Information Prompts"></a>Information Prompts</h3><p>Information prompts are a commonly used feedback method. By giving prompts and guidance after players perform interactive operations, players’ operations are further corrected. The timeliness of information feedback is very important, and it needs to be pointed out immediately when an operation occurs. <em>Hades</em> has strict requirements on the steps of operation. For example, you must collect rewards before entering the next level. If you press the button to interact with the door without completing it, the interface will display “Collect Rewards!” information feedback, and at the same time, there will be a light spot sliding to the reward item to prompt and guide the player. </p>

<h3 id="Secondary-Confirmation"><a href="#Secondary-Confirmation" class="headerlink" title="Secondary Confirmation"></a>Secondary Confirmation</h3><p>Secondary confirmation is very common in games. It generally appears after some important operation steps, prompting players to the possible results of this operation, so that players can make a more cautious judgment of their operations, and prevent possible misoperation situations. For example, when clicking exit during the <em>Devil May Cry 5</em> level, a secondary confirmation interface will pop up to ask, telling the player that if they exit at this time, they will continue from the last checkpoint when they restart, so that the player can confirm whether to return to the main menu. </p>

<h3 id="Revocable-Operations"><a href="#Revocable-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Revocable Operations"></a>Revocable Operations</h3><p>Although there is no “regret medicine” in the real world, the game world is imaginative, and anything can happen. Therefore, some games are very considerate to provide players with revocable operations, so that players can have the opportunity to make up for their mistakes after discovering them. For example, the store in <em>Revelation Online</em> has a repurchase function. After an item is sold, it will not disappear immediately, but will enter the repurchase list. If you accidentally sell the wrong thing, you can buy it back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F1bfe3517-db48-4a47-a82c-d194b5b3f059.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Dark Souls 3</em> also has this design. If the player accidentally hits a friendly NPC and forms a hostile relationship, they can pray at the Statue of Velka in the game to restore the relationship with the NPC. </p>

<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Postel’s Law tells us: the game needs to have two faces, one facing the player and the other facing the machine. The face facing the player needs to be open and inclusive, allowing the existence of diverse player operations and the input of various non-standard information; while the face facing the machine should follow the specifications and be cautious to avoid errors and confusion, so as to better convey the content to the player.</p>
<p>Fault-tolerant design in games is a very important part of the game experience. The application of Postel’s Law in games can help game designers design more stable systems and more user-friendly interfaces, improve the fault tolerance of game products, and thus further enhance the player’s game experience.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230628/28584_1095683.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With social progress and technological iteration, the form of social interaction has undergone various evolutions. From offline to online, the roles, spaces, and scenes of social interaction are constantly being reconstructed. People’s desire for expression and sharing has not diminished, and the social battleground has gradually shifted online. On the one hand, mature social products are emerging one after another, and on the other hand, games have become the social medium for most modern people, becoming a virtual scene carrying social interaction and also a topic of conversation after dinner.</p>
<p>From the perspective of game production and operation, game social interaction is an old topic. According to iResearch data, among all the reasons why domestic players leave a mobile game, “weak social attributes” account for 31%, ranking first in guiding players to “abandon the game”.</p>
<p>So, why is social interaction so important in games?</p>
<p>For manufacturers, social content is different from one-time consumable content (such as new storylines). It has low production pressure and strong sustainability. Most online games rely on social interaction to maintain player investment in the later stages, and social interaction between players is also an important part of revitalizing the game ecology. For players, interacting with others in the game can bring experiences such as a sense of identity, belonging, and superiority, which is also the main pleasure in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>Social interaction in games often revolves around collaboration, competition, supply and demand, etc., and combines with appropriate relationships to form an overall social structure. For example, players of the same level use warrior, mage, and priest class combinations to achieve combat division of labor. Players of different levels establish common goals for collaboration through large organizations, or achieve hard social needs through profit sharing and resource trading.</p>
<p>In the home system, social interaction gameplay often starts from the leisure perspective of the game, and creates more entertaining social experiences without putting pressure on players. Compared with traditional social interaction, home social interaction is more “leisurely”, “loving”, and “healing”. It allows players to interact with acquaintances or strangers without pressure, and can better help players integrate into the social ecology of the virtual world. This is the current general environment, and it is also a social scene that more players will pursue in future games. Therefore, the social interaction in the home system should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In past contacts with various game players, we found that there are many types of home social gameplay. The core pleasures of players are mainly divided into the following categories: management-oriented pleasure, home construction-oriented pleasure, and pure social-oriented pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="1-Home-Resource-Exchange"><a href="#1-Home-Resource-Exchange" class="headerlink" title="1. Home Resource Exchange"></a>1. Home Resource Exchange</h2><p>Driving social interaction with transactions is the most common way, and it is no exception in the home system. Like players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> exchanging specialties for cross-island trade, and players in <em>Revelation M</em> visiting friends’ homes to find daily flower merchants to buy rare flower seeds to exchange for home coins, this “differentiation” and “scarcity” can effectively mobilize players’ enthusiasm and motivate players to visit each other’s homes.</p>
<p>Specifically, taking <em>Animal Crossing</em> as an example, many players who enjoy collecting say that social interaction (going to other people’s islands) is a “rigid need” of the game. Because players are born in the southern or northern hemisphere, they have different (seasonal limited) insects and fish in different seasons, and these two contents account for a large proportion of the game’s collection elements. Although there are seasonal changes, due to the game’s time being synchronized with reality, in order to achieve the purpose of rapid collection, players need to travel between the two hemispheres, and visiting each other has become a necessary social link in the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fc5ee95c6-4ac0-45ad-9cc2-42a50ecb331e.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>《Animal Crossing》 Collection System - If you want to quickly collect all the illustrations, you need to visit other players’ islands to catch insects and fish</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, <em>Animal Crossing</em> also incorporates many random events, such as furniture, flower seeds, floor wallpapers randomly refreshed in the store, clothing sold in the clothing store unlocked with progress, and some random limited events such as carpet merchants and meteor showers (this type of event is an important way for players to obtain rare items). The random factors mean that visiting friends or strangers from time to time can discover new surprises, further stimulating players’ desire for this type of social interaction. </p>

Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home"></a>2. Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home</h2><p>Reciprocal (helping friends water flowers, pick vegetables, etc.) and entertaining (playing the piano, dancing, playing chess, playing cards, etc.) are common multi-person interactions in the home. Furniture interactions that can create beautiful memories together and casual mini-games where you can talk and laugh together are also social needs that players have high voices for. </p>

<hr>

<hr>
<p>In addition to small interactive props or casual gameplay, many players believe that holding party activities at home is also a great tool to promote social interaction in players’ small circles. For example, players who have participated in the <em>Heartopia</em> test have said that the free party is the social interaction they prefer. From preparing food and fireworks to inviting neighbors to the house, and then interacting together after the party officially starts, and finally taking a group photo, it’s a perfect ending. It is worth mentioning that the seemingly formal party gameplay has no substantial material rewards. What players can gain is the opportunity to become friends with neighbors who come to the appointment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F91917911-4ce7-42fd-aeaf-17a2f1259781.jpg/size/" alt="Party In Heartopia"></p>

Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities"></a>3. Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities</h2><p>In addition to visiting each other, co-living with multiple friends, interacting and entertaining, and creating a self-world for small groups are also the home social needs of many players. Couples&#x2F;roommate players in <em>Mole’s World</em> are quite fond of the process of building a home bit by bit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F75d8ddf3-1b68-4715-93bd-c65ba3c25bb8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Mole’s World》 - Public storage box for furniture, both parties can move their furniture into the public storage box for management and decoration</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similarly, <em>Justice Online</em>‘s multi-player manor also satisfies the “cohabitation” needs of many small group players. Even if they are on different servers from their friends, they can break the barriers between servers and gather multiple friends to build a manor together, creating a team building paradise.</p>
<p>In the community-like design of “Qiyunji”, players can think about how to plan the area of the entire manor together with their friends and conceive the overall manor style. In addition to home construction, players can also go fishing in Bixi or cooperate in treasure hunting with their close friends, interact with their friends’ pet cats and dogs, and even transform into a chef, show off their superb cooking skills, and prepare a table of delicacies for their friends. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fe0764a49-f399-4502-a3e4-08fd27b7a339.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Justice Online》 - Everyone is fishing together in the manor</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to such acquaintance communities, homes (or rather, communities) can also become opportunities and situations for stranger social interaction.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Heartopia</em> players also mentioned that the game’s special home social mechanism brought them unexpected surprises. Because each time you enter the game, up to 12 players will be randomly assigned to the same town, and players will meet 11 different people every day. The neighbor you passed by yesterday may be replaced the next time you log in.</p>
<p>The random mechanism creates distance for players who don’t like social interaction, and also brings a special social experience to the town. Every time you log in, there will be new neighbors, and new neighbors have the opportunity to become friends. From small things like watering flowers and playing with cats for neighbors, and completing a two-person action with neighbors, to big things like holding a party and inviting neighbors in the town to visit… In the end, it may precipitate a larger and more dynamic social network. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F6459c8e3-cd67-4104-94b7-1eaffb6664b3.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes"><a href="#4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes" class="headerlink" title="4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes"></a>4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes</h2><p>The home system is often accompanied by highly free construction and decoration gameplay. In addition to creating and designing their ideal beautiful homes, players are also committed to creating various fancy things by building houses, and this kind of curiosity-seeking fancy things can usually attract a large number of players and bring active spontaneous social interaction.</p>
<p>Some players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> like to try to move real scenes into the game and record important events in their lives that are ceremonial. For example, Japanese pixel artist BAN-8KU held a virtual exhibition “Kitten Exhibition”, attracting a large number of players to visit; a Twitter player named WhimsyWool moved her canceled graduation ceremony to the game, and the 18-second video instantly received 1.5 million views and 200,000 likes; many players also held weddings in Animal Crossing during the epidemic and posted them on social media, inviting netizens to witness together… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F830719a1-00e1-4443-a9e7-a87a02ecfcb4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Animal Crossing》 - Holding art exhibitions, job fairs, graduation ceremonies, weddings</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similar social situations also appear in domestic mobile games. The master players of <em>Mole’s World</em> decorate their homes into online bathhouses, internet cafes, bars, couple cinemas, hot spring hotels, study gardens… and invite netizens to check in online. Overnight, they became internet celebrity shops, attracting many players to follow the trend and queue up to visit. Players continue to post check-in guides and experiences on Weibo, Xiaohongshu and other platforms, and <em>Mole’s World</em> has also frequently gone out of the circle on social media because of this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F84348c80-d917-4d9a-82ab-a50055b36653.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%21%5BMole%20Manor%20Internet%20Cafe%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F8f3a1017-3f89-45c8-b85a-c7df0c57c07d.png/size/" alt="Mole Manor Bar"></p>
<p>What’s more, many players in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> buy houses to open RP shops (role play), providing various scenes for immersive role-playing, from small bars and teahouses, nightclubs and dance halls, schools and libraries, bathhouses and hotels, to large churches and museums, haunted houses and dungeon secret rooms, amusement parks and divination houses, photography studios, and even host clubs. Players’ brains are wide open, and they have played different tricks with the housing system.</p>
<p>Regarding RP shops, players can independently decorate their houses, become shop owners, hire people to play NPCs, and attract customers to consume; they can also find a favorite shop to apply for, play NPCs, and serve players who come to consume, such as providing services&#x2F;item transactions according to the menu and price list, providing chat and play services, playing musical instruments or dancing; they can also just visit and consume, or chat with NPCs or other players in the shop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Ffe9f8868-9d7f-469b-ac35-ea2b7a5690db.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《FF14》 - Theater RP &amp; Audience Appreciation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the long run, the RP shop industry chain has been derived in the game ecology. Players who want to play NPCs and players who want to contact NPCs each have their own fun, and gradually become a major feature of the game culture. In addition to promoting social interaction, RP shops have a certain stimulus for the demand for housing, furniture, and character costumes, and are also helpful to the economic cycle of the game. From this, we can also glimpse some inspiration for the commercialization of the game from the home system.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>In summary, the social interaction carried out by players through the home system and the fun obtained during the social interaction are nothing more than three kinds. One is the social interaction derived from management-oriented pleasure (stealing vegetables&#x2F;watering&#x2F;feeding&#x2F;special resource acquisition &amp; exchange, etc.), the second is the social interaction derived from home construction-oriented pleasure (display &amp; invitation to visit experience&#x2F;co-building home, etc.), and the third is pure social-oriented pleasure (social interaction in the home - interactive props&#x2F;social gameplay).</p>
<p>For the home as a social scene, most players care about whether they can simulate real life and feel the lively atmosphere of life. They regard the home as a leisure place for acquaintance social interaction, and will party, chat, dance, and hold weddings with friends in the home. At the same time, they do not exclude meeting friendly strangers through the home system and will interact. At the same time, the home is no longer limited to one person’s small home, but gradually forms a multi-person family, a community of more people, thus forming a social circle.</p>
<p>It is precisely this kind of non-mandatory and non-strong goal-oriented social interaction that makes players pay more attention to their social feelings of being cared for and valued, and it is precisely this kind of interaction that makes players actively deepen the connection between each other, and the home gradually evolves into a spiritual dwelling place in the virtual world.</p>

    <title>Why Does Music Content Customization Help Solve the Problem of Music Repetition</title>
    <url>/2023/06/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20230703_28584_1096586/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230703/28584_1096586.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the early days of video game development, audio experiences were often added to the game in the later stages of development, and were unlikely to fully meet the needs of game type, emotional content, background, etc. Today, in game development, it is often necessary to consider dimensions such as cost and player needs, but content consumption is always naturally faster than production, and game music still faces the problem of insufficient supply.</p>
<p>Game soundtracks themselves need to be adapted to the game’s level, map, and scene design. This high dependence on basic game design can lead to a problem: if the game itself does not adopt a highly differentiated and personalized design in terms of maps, scenes, characters, etc., even if the game soundtrack composers have tried to make as many changes as possible in the number of tracks and music structure design, it is still impossible to solve the problem of obvious homogeneity.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because if players stay on a specific map for a long time without exploring other maps, or if the overall map elements and general style of the game are relatively consistent, and unlike fantasy games that can accommodate many imaginative designs, what players hear is always music that is generally consistent in style. Even if there are subtle stylistic differences between different pieces of music, whether or not these differences can be heard depends largely on the player’s own level of musical aesthetic.</p>
<p>Therefore, game music often still faces the problem of high repetition, and even makes players bored and disgusted, directly muting the game.</p>
<p>So how can we explore potential solutions to this problem? This article will break down the problem from the aspects of players’ needs for music differentiation, factors affecting music perception, and music content customization, and discuss how to alleviate the problem of music repetition.</p>
<h2 id="1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation"><a href="#1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation" class="headerlink" title="1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation"></a>1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation</h2><p>Before starting the discussion, let’s briefly introduce the categories of various game music as an introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambient music</strong> (including large maps, dungeons, etc.): battle music, map music</li>
<li><strong>Functional music</strong> (instrumental performance, objects containing short musical snippets in the game, victory&#x2F;defeat music)</li>
<li><strong>Story music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cutscene music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Songs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, why do players need differentiated game music?</p>
<p>This needs to be analyzed from two levels: experience and function. From an experiential perspective, game music plays a role in creating an atmosphere, such as promoting the development of the plot climax and stimulating the player’s sense of tension in battle; in terms of functionality, game music can play a role in prompting information, such as customizing music according to the characteristics of the map, players can hear the national culture of a map from the music style, or the battle music will usually become more and more intense, thereby indicating the increase in the difficulty of the level. These are all components of immersion.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the game music is not differentiated, players will lack an auditory channel to grasp the information of the game, and will lose a certain degree of emotional investment, thus appearing to lack immersion. </p>

<h2 id="2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music"><a href="#2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?"></a>2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?</h2><p>After understanding that players have certain needs for music differentiation, what kind of music can highlight differentiation in the perception of players? We can first look at what factors will affect players’ perception of game music.</p>
<h3 id="The-Existence-of-Music"><a href="#The-Existence-of-Music" class="headerlink" title="The Existence of Music"></a>The Existence of Music</h3><p>Past psychological studies have found that the existence of music is self-evident for the creation of immersion and emotional connection in video games. However, in this regard, the existing research results present two extremes.</p>
<p>For some players, when the music is turned off, their emotions are detached from the game, and they believe that music is crucial for masking external noise and interference. But conversely, some people have suggested that if there is no music, they can better focus on the game experience, because music is a part of the game that players cannot actually control, which will make them feel less in control. This may be because when the music is turned off, players are more likely to hear other operation-related sound effects without being distracted by the music, so that they can be more immersed in the game.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music"><a href="#Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music"></a>Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music</h3><p>Generally speaking, players tend to choose familiar songs to get the emotions or emotional effects they want to enhance immersion. But in fact, the player’s prediction here is not necessarily correct. Because players lack experience in understanding the complex interaction between music and games, they may not be able to correctly choose the music they think can help achieve the desired effect. For example, when choosing battle music, players may tend to choose repetitive short songs, but in fact, repetitive short songs are easy to distract people, and they will make the atmosphere too tense, and even hinder the play of skills and battle strategies.</p>
<h3 id="Lyrics"><a href="#Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="Lyrics"></a>Lyrics</h3><p>Lyrics have the risk of distracting players, especially if players like the song, they will be immersed in the lyrics rather than the game. This is because players cannot ignore the familiar lyrics in the song when playing the game, and may even hum along. In addition, they will intentionally or unintentionally try to associate the lyrics with the game, which may be because most people are accustomed to watching visual effects that match the lyrics of the song, thereby establishing a connection between the visual effects and the lyrics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fe689bed0-d1f4-41a0-8103-e8cac074b9e4.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Differences-in-Music-Genres"><a href="#Differences-in-Music-Genres" class="headerlink" title="Differences in Music Genres"></a>Differences in Music Genres</h3><p>In addition, music types can also affect the gaming experience. Music that does not match the atmosphere of the corresponding scene will often increase the player’s anxiety and lead to a lack of concentration. Among them, certain music genres are more suitable for specific types of gameplay, which is also related to the historical development of the cultural connotation of music genres.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design"><a href="#Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Expectations for Music Design"></a>Players’ Expectations for Music Design</h3><p>Soundtrack design is adjusted by several game parameters during runtime, such as switching according to the player’s game progress, etc. Experienced gamers are usually aware of the important role of music in reminding them of danger or providing other game information. Therefore, they will expect music to play a role in prompting battle status, actions, etc., and when this expectation is met, they will have a higher sense of immersion, otherwise they will be aware of the lack of this information and affect the overall game experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization"><a href="#3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization" class="headerlink" title="3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization"></a>3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization</h2><p>Returning to the countermeasures for the problem of music repetition, one solution is to adopt a music content customization model. There are also many ways to customize music content, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Online improvisation:</strong> In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can improvise on the musical instruments in the game. This interactive mode adds more fun and more different possibilities to the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fdbad9544-36a1-497c-a19d-046510d6583d.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Player-composed music:</strong> The musician in <em>Revelation M</em> allows players to customize music scores to play. This model can not only satisfy players’ creative desires, but also generate music autonomously through a large player base, enriching the game’s music content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F3a4751ba-131a-4ae5-a138-da528b873130.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>In-game custom album series:</strong> <em>GTA</em> allows players to customize in-car music, so that players can not only choose the songs they want to listen to in the game, but also upload their own playlists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fb7c21e61-66d9-4790-bea4-733d87456af9.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, some game companies are open to mod creation and source code release, with the aim of encouraging players to edit and share new levels or content based on the game. In order to be able to add audio to the new levels created, some players will develop mod tools and share them with other players to help them automatically write music and sound effects. For example, AudioMod in <em>Minecraft</em> allows users to add new music and sound effects to the game.</p>
<p>When Microsoft launched their Xbox 360 console in 2005, they also mandated that all games made for the Xbox 360 must allow players to customize the soundtrack, that is, when players plug in other MP3 players, the game music will be turned off and replaced by the player’s own music.</p>
<h2 id="4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game"><a href="#4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game"></a>4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game</h2><p>Why can the method of music content customization solve the problem of game music homogeneity to a certain extent?</p>
<p>First, players will subconsciously and autonomously establish a connection between music and the game. No matter what happens between the current auditory and visual environment, players will connect all the presented information together to realize their in-game experience.</p>
<p>Behind this phenomenon, it is not only because music will affect the player’s perception of images, but images will also affect the perception of music. Choosing and listening to music is not regarded as a peripheral experience of gameplay. On the contrary, even music external to the game and chosen by the player will be regarded as part of the game experience. It is not only used to mask background noise or provide additional entertainment, but also to enhance the emotions generated during the game.</p>
<p>This highlights the importance of games as Gesamtkunstwerk (total art, that is, all arts are combined under a unified ideology): the game experience is not only visual effects, gameplay, or sound, but the combination of these elements to create a better experience for players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fbc4bff3c-b33c-41dc-8fca-0bd4aeefb584.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, the player’s sense of control over the game is also key. Music content customization allows them to have better control over the game environment, and this control over music content also changes their relationship with game music. Player research found that when they can choose the music they want, their state anxiety level (“state anxiety” refers to a temporary state of anxiety, rather than a longer-term personality trait), heart rate&#x2F;skin electrical response will decrease, indicating a lower level of emotional arousal. This effect is especially obvious in players who are less familiar with the game or the corresponding music.</p>
<p>But in the game, should players really be kept at a low level of anxiety? The answer is no, because the sufficient sense of anxiety provided by music can also drive players to continue to move forward in the game. For those players who pursue a more exciting sense of battle, they will prefer to experience songs that can increase anxiety. In addition, players generally expect a more dynamic emotional range when playing games, and the variability and adaptability of music play an important role in enhancing this emotional range. Therefore, the actual music design also needs to refer to the emotional experience process of players’ games and consider more.</p>
<p>In short, game music design needs to consider both players’ conscious tendencies and players’ unconscious cognitive habits. Only by combining the two can we design a soundtrack that matches the player’s game emotional process.</p>

    <title>The Magical 7 - Smooth Experience Design Under the Law of Memory</title>
    <url>/2023/06/29/netease-ux-articles/news_20230703_28584_1096587/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230703/28584_1096587.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1956, American psychologist George Miller published a paper titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” which discussed the relationship between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. The number of alternatives for one-dimensional absolute judgment hovers around 7, which is roughly equivalent to the limit of short-term memory. That is, the memory span of young people is about 7 units (Arabic numerals, letters, words, or other units). Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not absolute, and it is also related to the length, complexity, and memory proficiency of the memory unit.</p>
<p>This is Miller’s Law, which is widely respected in design.</p>
<p>Miller’s Law is one of the earliest research results on the content of short-term memory, and it is still widely applicable in design. For example, designers will consciously reduce the amount and complexity of information presented to users at the same time, actively integrate information, and adopt modular methods. These are the most basic practices of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>As a common scene of rapid thinking and short-term memory, game design should naturally conform to Miller’s Law. Next, this article will show you some design practices related to Miller’s Law in current games.</p>
<h2 id="1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden"><a href="#1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden" class="headerlink" title="1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden"></a>1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden</h2><p>People’s memory processing of information is limited. Usually, the more information there is, the harder it is for us to remember. This is a relatively easy-to-understand explanation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the easiest way to think of is to simply and rudely reduce the amount of information to reduce the user’s understanding burden. Facts have proved that reducing the amount of information is indeed quite effective. At present, the number of information chunks presented in people’s mobile phone software has basically not exceeded the range of “7±2”. The same is true for games.</p>
<p>But in fact, 20 years ago, Miller’s Law did not receive attention from designers in game design. MMORPG games in the early 21st century, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em>, had extremely “terrifying” skill buttons spread across the bottom of the screen. Some complex professions even had to press more than 20 skill buttons in a skill cycle! Although not all scenes need to use so many skills, the extremely complex key settings will still bring trouble to the player’s operation and memory, especially increasing the entry threshold for new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F600fd181-6960-40ae-95e6-e03c8d6430db.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The complex skill keys in “World of Warcraft” greatly increase the difficulty of getting started</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Later, with the emergence of MOBA games such as DOTA and LOL, this problem was alleviated. Take LOL as an example. Almost all heroes only have the following commonly used keys: 4 skills + 2 summoner skills + several equipment skills (basically no more than two). This falls exactly within the “7±2” range. The practice of Miller’s Law is actually one of the reasons why MOBA games are easy to get started and popular all over the world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F08229701-ce61-41f3-b6fd-cfa7ebd739b0.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The hero skill interface of LOL is much simpler, and the number of items players need to remember is also within the “7±2” range</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not only reflected in the number of skills. RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games bring Miller’s Law into full play. As a typical multi-threaded game, RTS requires players to control the overall situation and each “chunk”. According to research, in <em>StarCraft</em>, except for some professionally trained professional players, most ordinary players can only take care of six or seven game events at the same time, which has the same effect as Miller’s Law. These include back-end resource development, advance team reconnaissance, containment, frontal force attack, defense, etc., but no matter how the player operates, it is within the scope of Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F6ae8d06d-5b91-466c-b370-cefe8f031c9b.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Not to mention other events, attack alone can be divided into single-line and multi-line, ground-to-ground and ground-to-air</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, when designing, designers will also consider the design of multi-threading more or less: too few threads will make the game too simple and lack depth; too many threads will greatly increase the difficulty of the game.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many places that reflect this “magical 7”: the number of displays in the status bar and toolbar, the menu items on the UI, the number of key NPCs in the plot… These should basically fall within the range of “7±2”, otherwise, there will be a greater risk of causing players to obtain information and memory burden.</p>
<h2 id="2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding"><a href="#2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding"></a>2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding</h2><p>Miller’s research is not only on the “number 7”, but also on the concept of chunks and our ability to process memory information.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone will encounter the problem of too many APPs when using mobile phones. Only by classifying them into groups and naming each group correctly can the mobile phone desktop look clean. In fact, this is a daily manifestation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>When the amount of information is indeed excessive and cannot be simply and rudely compressed, it is an excellent method to match related information to different information units to form chunks. At this time, the component block replaces a single APP as the memory unit. As long as the number of chunks does not exceed “7±2”, it can easily and effectively help users process and understand information, so that they can quickly identify the content of interest, and “expand” the user’s memory span to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In games, this method has also been widely practiced.</p>
<p>In the UI design of FPS games, the current gun information, the number of bullets, the backup gun, and the throwing object information belong to the same type of elements. They are often grouped together as a whole and displayed at the bottom left or bottom right of the screen at the same time, reducing the burden on the player’s brain: just glance in one direction to get all the relevant information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F4d468337-a631-4693-8013-cedd3deed5c3.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>A large amount of information does not appear individually, but is grouped into “chunks” and regarded as a unit</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the character information (including health, skills, mechanism values, etc.) in ACT games also has the same characteristics, so it is often put together.</p>
<p>Not only the UI, but the backpack systems of many games also reflect this “classification” wisdom. Take the classic sandbox game <em>Minecraft</em> as an example. Its backpack has a one-click sorting function. As long as the player presses the corresponding button, the items will be automatically arranged according to the category; if you want to store, the chest interface also has a classification button with similar functions. After that, when players observe the backpack interface, they are no longer looking around like “headless flies”, but looking for the category first, and then looking for the corresponding item. The difficulty of obtaining information before and after sorting the backpack is very different, which also reflects the importance of chunks in Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fc34eafb5-4c13-4570-b2aa-6125b3b612a7.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience"><a href="#3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience"></a>3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience</h2><p>Another major method derived from Miller’s Law is: step-by-step design to reduce information density and optimize user experience. In fact, we are practicing the theory of distribution operations every day. Imagine what the user experience would be like if the food delivery APP put ordering, placing an order, filling in the address, and payment on the same interface? What if the mobile bank stuffed the key steps of transfer such as filling in information, obtaining a verification code, and identity confirmation all to the user? Step-by-step design has penetrated into all aspects of our daily life. Although it looks simple, its role cannot be underestimated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fa391b6cf-9e72-4132-bf44-5afbdb3e8221.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Step-by-step design of ordering in food delivery APP</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Game operations often encounter scenarios with particularly large amounts of information or complex business. Usually in game design, designers will first sort out the game process, and then process the corresponding information step by step, thereby reducing the impatient emotions brought to players by excessive information content in a single step, allowing players to immerse themselves in the current operation in each step.</p>
<p>The closest thing to step-by-step design in the game is the novice tutorial, because a large amount of information about the operation must be displayed to a person with no experience at all. At this time, how to achieve “clear explanation” while being “easy to understand” and “not discouraging” is the top priority of novice tutorial design.</p>
<p>At present, the novice tutorials of many games have implemented Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching form, most novice tutorials break down the teaching content into small pieces, and only teach one content at a time, such as operation methods, game rules, task goals, etc., to avoid confusion for new players; in terms of the amount of content, although the types and focus of various game operations are different, the number of key teaching nodes in many novice tutorials falls exactly within the range of “7±2”. This is not a coincidence, but an imperceptible manifestation of Miller’s Law in design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F97dc54e3-fff5-4844-a55f-f6d29f2216ba.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Destiny 2”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in <em>Destiny 2</em>, although its novice tutorial lasts nearly half an hour, there are actually only a few key teaching points, many of which are already familiar to players (such as movement, jumping, use of firearms, etc.). The information density can be said to be quite low, which also reflects that <em>Destiny 2</em> is not a very hardcore FPS game. At the same time, the 8 teaching points also fall within the range of Miller’s Law “7±2”, and the overall rhythm and the player’s memory burden have been fully optimized.</p>
<p>And <em>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em> obviously also conforms to this rule: step-by-step teaching, and the number is limited to the range of “7±2”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F55ef574a-0e2f-44ec-97b4-9ec67422e76a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, inserting plots in the novice tutorial is not only an excellent way to introduce the game world view and explain the background, but also has the effect of reducing information density, allowing users to slowly absorb teaching knowledge and giving players time to remember and digest. This is also why many games like to use the perspective of the protagonist to advance the plot while killing enemies, and embed novice tutorials in the plot.</p>
<p>Of course, not only novice tutorials, but many puzzle game level designs also adopt step-by-step design. At this time, players will no longer advance the level linearly, but obtain information and resources in a step-by-step manner, reflecting the core of puzzle games: information acquisition and information use. And Miller’s Law solves the user experience problem during information acquisition.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic puzzle game <em>Rusty Lake: Paradise</em>, players can see many shadows of step-by-step design. From the perspective of the entire game, its plot process is divided into ten levels (that is, ten disasters), and this division optimizes the user’s plot intake experience; from the perspective of a single level, different information is placed in different small scenes, but the amount of information in each scene is very small, which is also a decrease in information density, which helps to reduce the information collection burden of players, and uses the layout of each small scene to make players form associations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F140e2074-a949-4867-8e4b-6fc11d834d22.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The smallest unit of “Rusty Lake: Paradise”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It can be seen that due to the particularity of puzzle games, the amount of information cannot be controlled within the range of “7±2”, and at this time, step-by-step design is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The application of Miller’s Law in design is mainly to solve the user memory problem caused by information blocks. Reasonable information layout and information processing can greatly improve the user’s reading and memory of information. In game design, following Miller’s Law can control the complexity and difficulty of the game, improve the playability and user experience of the game; at the same time, it can also help new players better understand and master the game rules and gameplay.</p>
<p>Game designers can practice Miller’s Law by controlling the number and combination of game rules, interface elements, etc., designing game content step by step, and adopting interactive teaching methods, so as to create a simpler and easier-to-understand game experience, and improve the user satisfaction and reputation of the game. However, Miller’s Law should also be used flexibly, and do not misuse the “magical 7” to make unnecessary restrictions on the design. Analyzing specific situations is the best policy for design.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230710/28584_1097806.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Ten minutes to start the game, two hours to customize the face.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a widely circulated saying among players in MMORPG games.</p>
<p>In recent years, the character customization system has gradually become a standard feature of role-playing games (RPG), and many players love it. What is the charm of character creation that makes players so obsessed? The Proteus effect mentions that when individuals are given different character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits.</p>
<p>In games with social attributes, this means that when players put on a custom game avatar, they will project their good expectations of themselves onto this avatar, and because of the beautiful appearance of the avatar, their behavior will tend to move closer to the avatar, and they will also tend to be more friendly and enthusiastic in game social interactions. </p>

<p>Nowadays, the customization function of game character images is becoming increasingly refined, allowing players to infinitely approach their ideal game image through these highly free customizations.</p>
<p>From the early days when you could only change the face shape, hairstyle, and body shape from a given number of templates, the character creation system has evolved to be able to adjust parameters such as size, position, and rotation through hundreds of fine dimensions. The degree of detail is so great. At the same time, in addition to improving freedom and sophistication to meet the ultimate pursuit of character creation experts, this customization system has also created a threshold for novice character creators.</p>
<p>On the Internet, we mostly hear the voices of “experts” and hear their needs for character creation functions, while the voices of ordinary players are often ignored. To this end, we have summarized the real feedback of ordinary players in different game character creation tests, combined with game examples, and analyzed how to improve the experience of ordinary players in a complex character creation system.</p>
<h2 id="1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems"><a href="#1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems"></a>1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems</h2><p>The use of game character creation functions is roughly divided into two parts: preset selection and detailed character creation.</p>
<p>In the preset selection, you can choose your favorite style from the given options, directly use this style to enter the game, or enter detailed character creation; in detailed character creation, you can adjust the size, position, orientation, color, brightness and other parameters of each part of the face step by step. It is no exaggeration to say that there are a thousand parameter results for a thousand players, truly achieving the so-called thousand faces for a thousand people.</p>
<p>The detailed character creation of most games is divided into three major sections: shaping, makeup, and hairstyle.</p>
<p>The current facial shaping function can adjust the content that basically covers every muscle of the face. Take <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, there are as many as 36 subdivided modules in the facial shaping part alone, and each module has 4-6 parameter settings. Shaping mostly covers the face shape, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, and each part is subdivided into multiple sub-parts that can be adjusted. In the adjustment of eyebrows, in addition to large items such as eyebrow shape, eyebrow position on the face, and eyebrow distance, the position of the brow, middle brow, and brow tail are also open for custom adjustment. Moreover, <em>Revelation M</em> also features the addition of ear adjustments, where players can adjust the ear contour, angle, and sharpness. </p>

<p>The makeup system can add more personalized settings to the face on the basis of shaping, maximizing fashion and atmosphere. Makeup generally includes several core sections - eyebrow makeup, eyeliner and eyeshadow, eyelashes, colored contacts, blush, lip gloss, facial accessories, skin tone, or contouring and highlighting for the entire face. Players can customize the style, color, and concentration of the makeup in each part. In more refined games, it is even possible to adjust the local area separately to achieve color clashing and color mixing effects. It can be said that it is a one-to-one reproduction of the freedom of makeup in the real world. </p>

<p>The complexity of the hairstyle module is obviously much simpler than the previous two. The function of this module is mainly realized through preset styles, and players can choose from a given number of hairstyles to more than ten. In some games with a high degree of freedom, players can customize the length of the hairstyle, the position of the braids, etc., and the hair color can also be adjusted through the full-color gamut color wheel, and even gradient colors can be set. Whether it is a dazzling two-dimensional or ordinary black, brown and gray, you can find your own spectrum. </p>

<h2 id="2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System"><a href="#2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System" class="headerlink" title="2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System"></a>2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System</h2><p>After the above review, everyone will clearly find that although it is just a simple “character creation”, the content covered is very rich. Accompanying such a high degree of freedom is often a high threshold; the more customizable options there are, the more difficult it is for players to find their own direction.</p>
<p>In user research, more than one player has told us: “I will also create the face, but in the end, I use the preset or directly buy the image. I really can’t create it. I can be serious at the beginning, but I get bored later. I feel that what I create is not good-looking, so I might as well buy it.”</p>
<p>Most ordinary players will express it very kindly, “It’s my own problem, I don’t know how to create, for people who are厲害 (lì hai - awesome), high freedom is very good.” But in the actual experience, their feelings of embarrassment and helplessness, and the lack of confidence due to the frustration of character creation, are also real.</p>
<p>In detail, under the high threshold brought by high freedom, ordinary players (or non-expert character creators) may face the following dilemmas when using the custom appearance function.</p>
<p><strong>The first dilemma:</strong> The naming of each facial structure in the high-freedom character creation system is too professional, and there is a certain knowledge threshold. In a highly free character creation system, a face can be divided into dozens of components. For example, the facial contour is divided into: forehead, temples, apple cheeks, cheekbones, cheeks, upper jaw, lower jaw, jaw angle, chin, etc., which are all professional names for human facial muscle structure or makeup. Each part also has a variety of adjustment methods. Players who are not familiar with these on a daily basis will inevitably feel confused, “What is this? What is that? They are too similar.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F46f71505-699d-4f51-9455-c187a001403d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without sufficient character creation experience, players often need to spend more time to check and try one by one to understand which area each block is in charge of. In such a high cognitive load scenario, it is also necessary to spend extra mental effort to try to get started, and the final combination effect may not be satisfactory. The joy of DIY may not be so pure.</p>
<p><strong>The second dilemma:</strong> Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament and effect. Just like people who don’t pay attention to makeup don’t know how to apply highlights and contour, or how to draw eyeliner and eyeshadow when they first learn makeup to achieve a pure and lovely or cold and domineering temperament. The same is true for novice&#x2F;entry-level players who are not character creation experts: lack of aesthetic knowledge, it will be difficult to get started.</p>
<p>For example, cuteness generally means that there should be some youthful features on the face, such as a short face, large eyes, a smaller proportion of the upper court, and a relatively full expression of soft tissues; purity requires a certain bluntness of the five senses. If there are more acute angles in the five senses, the feeling of shrewdness is more prominent, and it is not easy to show a pure temperament. Players without this basic knowledge of facial aesthetics will find it difficult to land the temperament they prefer in their hearts on the design (character creation) of specific parts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F26010507-2caf-4f7b-897d-4d98536d38c4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Facial aesthetic standards of three courts and five eyes</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The third dilemma:</strong> Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the parts they create is far from the target face. Based on the experience of looking at faces before, players will have their own preferences for the specific appearance of some facial features, but the overall aesthetic control of the face is relatively vague. When players painstakingly adjust each one for a long time, and finally create the desired oval face, smiling eyes, and sexy lips, they find that although each part is roughly what they want and looks good, the whole face is not coordinated and beautiful enough. At this time, to modify, they will issue painful entanglements of “I don’t know where to start”, “What changes can make the face harmonious and distinctive”, and “Do I still want to enter the game”.</p>

When it comes to the specific character creation system settings, the solutions can be divided into the following types of functions.</p>
<h3 id="Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level"><a href="#Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level" class="headerlink" title="Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level."></a>Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level.</h3><p>Generally speaking, the section division in the simple mode is more general, and there will be fewer adjustable parameters, which is suitable for players who pursue the overall effect but do not like to抠细节 (kōu xì jié - fuss over details); the expert mode has a more detailed division and more adjustable parameters, which is suitable for character creation professionals who pursue high precision. Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. In the simple mode, you only need to select the sample and overall parameter adjustment for the face and facial features, while the expert mode can adjust the parameters of each subdivided area of the facial features, including displacement, rotation, and zoom. Players can freely switch between the two modes to meet different application scenarios, which is more flexible. </p>

<li><strong>Prepare several preset faces, preset eye shapes, eyebrow shapes, lip shapes, etc.</strong> Players can create exquisite faces just by combining various templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>New Fantasy Zhu Xian</em> as an example. When entering the character creation system, players can choose from nearly ten preset faces with different facial features and hairstyles. After selecting the preset face, they can also choose from more than a dozen facial styles with different facial features and temperaments. This choice can help players quickly locate the overall effect they want. In <em>Life Makeover</em>, not only are there preset faces for players to choose from, but each facial feature and makeup section also has a large number of preset styles to choose from. Players can even obtain an exquisite face without making any parameter adjustments, just by combining various facial feature styles. </p>

<li><strong>Random character creation</strong>, you can directly choose the one you like the most among a large number of randomly generated appearances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. Players can use the random function to choose from a large number of appearances, and pick the one that surprises them the most among these “blind boxes”. However, the randomly generated results of some games may have uneven quality, and players may need to spend more time if they want to get a satisfactory appearance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fffd16876-b55c-4e16-8b9f-6c2aa41f9aa6.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Character creation sharing hall or character creation code</strong>, players can directly quote popular face templates in the in-game sharing hall, or obtain a sharing code on the external sharing platform for one-click import.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> as an example. If players do not want to create their own faces, they can also directly enter the “Master Character Creation” sharing hall, where players can choose works that match their aesthetics according to body type and temperament labels, and import them with one click. If you want to copy a high-value face on the external social platform of the game, you can also import it with one click through the character creation sharing code, eliminating the trouble of step-by-step fine-tuning according to the tutorial, which is a lazy person’s happiness code. </p>

<li><strong>Temperament concept character creation</strong>, players can choose the desired temperament effect through the wheel, and the system will automatically adjust the facial structure to present it in a direction that matches the temperament type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, players can move between the four temperament dimensions of “immortal”, “childish”, “gentle”, and “fierce” through the temperament wheel. This intuitive change in the concept of temperament can quickly help players determine what kind of face they want. When you want a pure and childish little junior sister face, you only need to drag the wheel to move in the direction of “childish” to roughly achieve it. </p>

At the same time, some games will also have built-in functions to restore the initial and reset the current part (such as <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>), so that players can directly reset a part of the area or the whole with one click when they are not satisfied, and clear and restart at any time. In addition, some games also have the functions of “import” and “export”. For example, in <em>Life Makeover</em>, players can export each step of the operation in real time, and then import and read the file with one click for “repentance” or to restart at any time after interrupting the character creation. </p>

<li><strong>Photo character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Through photo intelligent character creation, the system can read the pictures of the player himself, celebrities, or even two-dimensional characters, and quickly produce a similar face in a few seconds. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, you only need to upload a photo, and the system can generate a character image with a hairstyle and makeup that matches the photo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2aa2f7a4-7c13-474a-8caf-f8ddf93ab605.png/size/"></p>

<li><strong>Real-time AR expression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In some games equipped with AR scanning, players only need to turn on the camera, and the character’s expression will change in real time according to the player, such as smiling or squinting, and every frown and smile will move with the player.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The text character creation function of <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> makes game character creation easier. Players only need to spend a few seconds to enter some adjectives or the names of celebrities. With the support of AI’s black technology, they only need 1 second of cloud computing to turn the fantasy in the player’s mind or the image of their favorite celebrity into real character creation data in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, players can even enter more abstract verses. For example, directly enter “云想衣裳花想容，春风拂槛露华浓” (yún xiǎng yī shang huā xiǎng róng, chūn fēng fú kǎn lù huá nóng), and the player will get the prototype of Yang Guifei. If you really can’t think of descriptive text, there is also a random text function. Click random to generate the corresponding character image according to a large number of verses, truly realizing lazy character creation in one step. </p>

<li>Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament effect;</li>
<li>Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the created parts is far from the target face.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the difficulties encountered by non-expert players in the user research conclusions, game developers have taken some measures to reduce the operational and knowledge barriers, so that they can also enjoy the joy of character creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level;</li>
<li>Provide a large number of optional templates to help players locate the desired overall effect. For example, provide preset faces and preset part styles; random character creation, character creation sharing hall, or character creation code import; temperament concept character creation, etc.</li>
<li>Set the functions of reset, undo, restore, and save to reduce the cost of trial and error for players.</li>
<li>With the assistance of AI technology, help players complete the visualization and specific operations of concepts into pictures, and create the target face they want in one step. For example, photo character creation, AR expressions, text character creation, etc.</li>

    <title>Following Intuition Mobile Game Gesture Design to Create Invisible Interactions</title>
    <url>/2023/07/07/netease-ux-articles/news_20230710_28584_1097837/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230710/28584_1097837.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most mobile game interactions rely on the UI interface. However, there are some operations that do not rely on the UI, which are pure gesture interactions, namely, moving, zooming, and rotating. In the presence of UI, the player’s behavior path is generally: “See UI control - Generate operation expectation based on the control - Make corresponding operation - Verify through feedback”. However, in the absence of UI cues, players directly generate expectations, and all operations are performed based on the player’s experience and intuition.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can summarize the indicators for evaluating gesture interaction into 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> The gesture operations that players try to perform by intuition can help them achieve their goals, and use the most concise operation flow.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable:</strong> The operation result is controllable and in line with expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback prompts after the operation are used to prompt the player whether the operation is correct or whether the operation is in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article will introduce these 3 evaluation indicators and elaborate on them with practical development experience and specific application examples.</p>
<h2 id="1-Intuitive-Design-in-Games"><a href="#1-Intuitive-Design-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Intuitive Design in Games"></a>1. Intuitive Design in Games</h2><p>The habitual gestures for mobile game players are actually very simple, nothing more than single-finger dragging and double-finger zooming. But in the actual development process, we found that there is still much to learn.</p>
<h3 id="If-a-Goal-Can-Be-Achieved-in-One-Step-Do-Not-Divide-it-into-Two-Steps"><a href="#If-a-Goal-Can-Be-Achieved-in-One-Step-Do-Not-Divide-it-into-Two-Steps" class="headerlink" title="If a Goal Can Be Achieved in One Step, Do Not Divide it into Two Steps"></a>If a Goal Can Be Achieved in One Step, Do Not Divide it into Two Steps</h3><p>Zooming and dragging correspond to two different operations. But by comparing some common apps, we can find that if the player can drag while zooming, or even rotate, it will be much smoother than zooming first and then dragging, and it is more in line with the player’s expectations. The Android Material Design specification also mentions this. The first figure below shows the scenario where double fingers only support zoom operations. It can be seen that the finger touch points do not match the screen, giving a feeling of lag. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fe2fb89d4-c1cc-4027-a943-58a4e857aeef.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Material Design - Demonstrates a Situation Where Multiple Gesture Operations Cannot Be Supported Simultaneously</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the map zoom process of the mobile game <em>Knives Out</em>, we can see that players can determine the axis they want to zoom through two fingers, which can help players confirm the position they want to zoom in one step. However, because they cannot drag while zooming, they cannot drag the position to the visual center, so there is still a slight lag. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fa71c0362-da07-49d5-89fc-1b4204c44c03.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 In-Game Map</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The reason for this feeling is that when players zoom in on the map to view, they usually have a clear target point. At this time, if the player is required to first zoom based on the center of the screen and then drag, this clear target point will deviate from the player’s visual center, or even go off-screen.</p>
<p>However, in map software, players can use two fingers to complete dragging and moving operations at the same time. Therefore, we can see that if you want to zoom out and push away the “Shidai Elevated Road” in the picture, you only need to perform one operation. </p>

<p><em>Material Design - Two Fingers Can Simultaneously Zoom, Drag, and Rotate</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The map system of the iOS photo album function implements this principle. Players can simultaneously complete dragging, zooming, and rotating in one two-finger operation. The operation process is very smooth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F4c955de9-a288-42d8-9f39-0390106c4fe2.gif/size/"></p>

How should we choose when these two operations conflict?</p>
<p>Analyzing the drawing behavior, in this scenario, the most frequently used operation by players is single-finger smearing, while dragging the canvas is only an auxiliary means to better smear, and dragging can be performed simultaneously with two-finger zooming. Therefore, in this case, we can consider letting the single-finger dragging function give way to smearing, and dragging is realized through the offset of two fingers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fd087fa83-79af-4b3f-a9b2-9c27c344718a.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-Predictable-Operation-Results"><a href="#2-Predictable-Operation-Results" class="headerlink" title="2. Predictable Operation Results"></a>2. Predictable Operation Results</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, players have psychological expectations when performing gesture operations. This expectation is not only a mapping relationship such as two fingers corresponding to zooming and one finger corresponding to dragging, but also means that players need to be able to accurately and efficiently complete their goals during the operation process. Generally speaking, the sensitivity of the response greatly affects this point. High sensitivity will be relatively more efficient; low sensitivity will be more precise. How do we balance this?</p>
<h3 id="Sensitivity-Adjustment-There-are-Demands-for-Both-“Follow-Hand”-and-“Not-Follow-Hand”"><a href="#Sensitivity-Adjustment-There-are-Demands-for-Both-“Follow-Hand”-and-“Not-Follow-Hand”" class="headerlink" title="Sensitivity Adjustment: There are Demands for Both “Follow-Hand” and “Not Follow-Hand”"></a>Sensitivity Adjustment: There are Demands for Both “Follow-Hand” and “Not Follow-Hand”</h3><p>Here, “follow-hand” means that when the player starts a gesture operation, the position where the finger touches the operation object is the same as the position when the operation ends. On the map, it means: when starting to zoom in on the map, the thumb is at point A and the index finger is at point B, and the same is true after zooming in on the map.</p>
<p>Material Design mentions that “follow-hand” interaction is the most intuitive interaction. Comparing the following two figures, the first one is obviously much more comfortable than the second one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2db87960-d1ad-4c4e-bdd6-3df7e9a0d5ed.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>Material Design - Non-Follow-Hand Dragging</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We can also see this difference in the operation of common sliding lists.</p>
<p>When dragging slowly, the sliding list is “follow-hand”, which is convenient for users to locate the position they want. When the user swipes quickly, the list is usually swiped quickly, allowing the user to efficiently operate the long list in a short time.</p>
<p>In the first figure below, it is the case of slow dragging, and the movement of the list is “follow-hand”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F8906328c-ce9a-4d17-b1cf-84fc454293ae.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Douban - Movie List - Slow Dragging</em></p>

<p>The second one is a quick swipe, especially in this horizontal layout, the content that can be displayed on one screen is limited, and swiping allows users to quickly move the list. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Douban - Movie List - Swiping</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This sliding operation is very common, for example, in the BP list of <em>Knives Out</em>, “follow-hand” dragging allows players to perform back-and-forth dragging operations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F854f50c2-eb45-4e79-8ea2-cd7f1c1bffa3.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>There is also an application of a special scenario: the sensitivity is very low, and the movement of the content on the interface will be very slow, behaving as if it is resisting the user’s operation. Usually, this situation will make people feel laggy, but there are also very practical application scenarios:</p>
<p>For example, many applications can enter a new interface or trigger a refresh page after pulling down a certain distance on the home page. This stickiness during dragging can remind the user that there will be different changes on the interface, which is equivalent to a double confirmation, helping the user not to perform unnecessary misoperations. The trigger page on the home page of the shopping app is such an example, the further you slide down, the slower it becomes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Febccab47-efce-446b-9646-917fba623538.gif/size/"></p>

<p>For example, in single-finger rotation operations, we found slight feel differences. Sensitivity needs to be adjusted for the demand, and that often means higher sensitivity. The below picture’s rotation would be reasonably fast, even with only a half screen distance. </p>

<h2 id="3-Give-Players-Timely-Feedback"><a href="#3-Give-Players-Timely-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="3. Give Players Timely Feedback"></a>3. Give Players Timely Feedback</h2><p>Giving players feedback during gesture operations can clearly inform the player of the operation status.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to focus on vibration feedback. As a form of expression outside the interface, vibration feedback can not only remind the player of the operation status, but also enhance the sense of immersion. For example, on the Chrome home page, you can trigger 3 functions by swiping down, and you can switch functions by dragging left and right during the sliding process. How do you let the player know that they have dragged in place and can let go? In addition to the water drop-like animation performance on the interface, Chrome also adds a slight vibration prompt to inform the player of this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fd32573b9-4cee-444d-b330-f8fc1d6ef91e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Chrome Browser Home Page Pulls Down to Switch Between 3 Functions</em></p>
<hr>
<p>iPhone has a powerful Taptic Engine, which can define a variety of vibration intensities to meet different usage scenarios. For example, in the game <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players will trigger a weak vibration when clicking on interactive objects, and if the flight energy is insufficient, it will trigger a stronger vibration prompt together with the UI animation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F241d5335-b00d-4bd5-a9c8-755a9cf122aa.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Sky: Children of the Light》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is also such vibration feedback in Rayark’s ARPG mobile game <em>Implosion</em>. When the player’s armor is damaged, the mobile phone emits two-stage vibrations, together with screen shaking and special effects for strong prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fc27e3039-9617-4602-a848-88460b6a3e56.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Implosion》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the armor is broken, the loss of health is changed to a lighter one-stage vibration, and the screen shaking is also weakened. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F0acd61ae-2692-4fa7-9a5c-4946a21bafc1.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many mobile phones do not have such a powerful vibration intensity customization function, and the vibrations are relatively simple, so they are not very suitable for diversified application scenarios, and it is also difficult to provide players with a deeper sense of immersion in touch. Vibration feedback cannot yet be used as a universal form of feedback, and we rarely see its large-scale use in mobile games.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The important thing about gesture interaction design is to follow the player’s inner thoughts and give the player feedback on whether the operation is successful or not, giving the player a “sense of certainty” in the absence of a UI interface. A slight deviation between gesture design and intuition will cause a strange feel, so it is not enough to just talk about it on paper. It is necessary to constantly compare and adjust on real devices during the development process to achieve the smoothest gesture interaction.</p>

<h2 id="1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="1. The Necessity of Game Localization"></a>1. The Necessity of Game Localization</h2><p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is one of the most active and growing game markets in the world in recent years. More and more developers are adopting different strategies to localize their video games into Arabic, undoubtedly seeing the huge growth potential here.</p>
<p>The localization of a game, especially in markets with good demand fit, a large player base, and weak English proficiency, can have a huge impact. According to statistics, the sales of <em>Gremlins, Inc.</em> increased eightfold within just three months of the release of the Simplified Chinese version, and it became the best-selling language version of the game, accounting for 31% of total sales. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fb55812ae-12f0-49b4-8674-f1558151a259.png/size/" alt="Gremlins, Inc. Sales Data"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Under such market appeal, many production teams will choose to test the waters first and localize part of the game content into Arabic. A more common approach is to start with dubbing, using standard language or dialects for dubbing or subtitles.</p>
<p>However, in the absence of specific research on local player needs and localization expectations, blind action may have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s <em>The Division 2</em> (2019) had a failed dubbing attempt. The game used the Syrian dialect for voice-overs and cutscenes. After Ubisoft released the game trailer, the Arab gaming community expressed dissatisfaction with the Syrian dialect in the game, which forced Ubisoft to change the game language to Modern Standard Arabic. This choice not only cost Ubisoft extra money to re-localize, but also increased the additional time cost.</p>
<p>When deciding to make a localized version, developers will weigh factors such as time, cost, and expectations for the target market. These factors determine the strategy to start the game localization and which game content will be localized into the target language. The currently existing game localization strategies can be divided into four main categories: zero localization, printed materials, partial localization, and full localization.</p>
<p>For example, for some immersive RPG games, especially when the screen contains important interactive elements, it is helpful to partially localize the subtitles for players who do not understand the source language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F5000ad2f-616e-44a0-9c21-3e7b0e55ddfc.png/size/" alt="The Witcher 3 Arabic Dialogue"></p>

Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market"></a>2. Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market</h2><p>When it comes to selling games in the target market, video games with zero localization dominate the Arab market because manufacturers believe that Arabic-speaking players who can speak English will buy games in the source language, so they can get some extra sales without investing in the localization process.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (2018) and <em>NBA2K20</em> (2019), which are popular in the Middle East, the lack of this translation has paved the way for the emergence of Arabic fan localization. Fans in the Middle East translate their favorite games accordingly or provide guides with Arabic commentary or subtitles on YouTube. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fccbe643b-2142-45aa-a8b1-ef44687bd471.png/size/" alt="Red Dead Redemption Arabic Guide on Youtube"></p>

<p>In the mid-1990s, packaging and manual localization prevailed in the Arab game market. This part of the localization requires translating a game’s packaging and player’s manual. This level of localization is defined as “market-driven localization”, which also includes the localization of the game’s e-store introduction, website, and installation wizard. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F13b4de80-debe-440a-8f97-b69ad2c80ad9.png/size/" alt="FIFA 1995 Arabic Packaging and Manual"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In-game localization strategies also include partial and full localization. Partial localization includes providing translations of in-game text, such as user interface (UI), and subtitles for animations and audio. Full localization involves localizing all game content into the target language, including translating packaging, manuals, and user interfaces, as well as dubbing audio files and illustrations. The following figure counts the number of games (142 in total) that have been localized into Arabic using different strategies between 2005 and 2020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2c3d9454-5ad7-4066-a1b7-0498e4834c83.png/size/" alt="Number of Games Localized into Arabic 2005-2020"></p>

<p><em>Number of Games Localized into Arabic from 2005 to 2020</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at some examples of Arabic products that use various localization strategies and the different effects they bring.</p>
<h3 id="User-Interface-and-Subtitles"><a href="#User-Interface-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="User Interface and Subtitles"></a>User Interface and Subtitles</h3><p>The core of partial localization lies in localizing the in-game text and converting the subtitles of voice-overs and cutscenes into the target language. Most companies that want to release games in the Arab region adopt this partial localization. Successful examples include <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015), <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> (2016), <em>Resident Evil 7</em> (2017), <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> (2018), <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> (2019), and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> (2020) - all of which have been well received by Arab players. According to data surveys, about 48% of these games use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F95963434-8546-4857-a4fa-15128be3cd4a.png/size/" alt="Rise of the Tomb Raider Arabic Version"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Rise of the Tomb Raider》 Arabic Version</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, due to the particularity of Arabic, excessively long subtitles will affect the playability of the game and have a negative impact on the immersion of the game. In this case, instead of enjoying the graphics and gameplay, players may spend more time reading the subtitles. In this regard, including low-quality subtitles may have a negative impact on players’ understanding and overall gaming experience. Due to the lack of experience and historical case studies on Arabic subtitles, there is a lack of reference templates and experience for Arabic subtitles in games, which makes it difficult for game companies and localizers to adjust the game during the actual operation.</p>
<p>The Arabic subtitles in <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015) used MSA to localize into Arabic; however, the excessively small font size and long subtitles to fit the screen have adversely affected the intelligibility of the game and the introduction of the entire storyline. Some subtitles in the game contain 8 sentences and strings of more than 200 characters, which is quite lengthy. So, the tenacious Arabic players, in order to continue playing the game, began to make their own comfortable-looking font replacement Mods and shared them on online forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fb1d1aefd-e2c5-44b4-a9eb-3e75e7564ae1.png/size/" alt="The Witcher 3 Arabic Font Mod"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>Some games only provide localization services for the user interface. This approach only involves minimal localization so that players who do not speak the game’s source language can launch the game and customize the settings according to their preferences. Games that adopt this localization strategy include <em>Goat Simulator</em> (2014) and <em>Squad</em> (2015). Manufacturers may usually adopt this method in order to compress the localization budget and improve the release efficiency, mainly to test the acceptance of the game in specific regions, without investing a lot of money and additional development time in a more in-depth localization process.</p>
<p>There are also some situations where the game code itself does not support providing subtitles for dialogues; the game itself does not rely on dialogues to build the game experience, etc. For example, <em>The Bridge</em> (2013) and <em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em> (2019) can both be played smoothly in Arabic at this level of localization. In this case, Arabic players can access all linguistic content (in-game text, such as menus and instructions) in Arabic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F27ecb01c-60ba-4b41-a9e8-31323225176f.png/size/" alt="Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey Arabic UI"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey》 Arabic UI</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>The practice of localizing only subtitles is not uncommon in the Arab video game market - only providing subtitles for the game’s voice-overs and cutscenes, that is, without localizing the user interface or in-game text. It is often used in games that rely heavily on dialogue, such as <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2014, 2015, 2017) and <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> (2016).</p>
<p>However, in some cases, technical issues in the game code or game engine prevent developers from providing Arabic localization with subtitles. Ubisoft Middle East localization director Malek Teffaha also said: “[Subtitles] are a matter of budget and game engine limitations. In our engine, support for Arabic text direction and fonts is not yet complete.” When designing games, consideration should be given to localizing the interface into other languages; developers should be prepared to handle game code in different languages from the beginning.</p>
<p>Localization is often an aspect that is easily overlooked during the game development process, and the development team may also lack knowledge of certain language characteristics, so they develop a game code whose interface may not fully support them.</p>
<p>For players who do not understand the game’s source language, the ‘subtitles only’ approach is problematic. For example, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> lacks localized instructions and in-game ‘tips’. The following figure is taken from the loading screen of <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>. Along the bottom of the screen, the game writes a tip for players: “If you forget how to use something in the game, you can use the Know-It-All app to get some tips and tricks at any time.” However, many Arabic players cannot get useful information through this prompt due to language barriers. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Between 2005 and 2020, 142 games have been localized into Arabic. Before 2000, localized games were not common. However, with the surge in the number of Arab gamers, major manufacturers have realized the huge potential of this market in the past 15 years and have begun to increase the number of Arabic localized games.</p>
<p>Choosing the level of full localization requires a lot of technical and working time, so the cost is high and time-consuming. Therefore, products usually adopt different levels of localization strategies to find a cost-effective localization route that is suitable for their own product characteristics, skillfully allowing players to understand and smoothly experience the game, thereby opening a window to overseas target users.</p>

    <title>How to Find the Right Rhythm for Game Updates</title>
    <url>/2023/07/11/netease-ux-articles/news_20230712_28584_1098334/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230712/28584_1098334.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Game updates are a topic of concern for both developers and players, and a headache for both.</p>
<p>Facing bugs, constantly adjusting operational plans, and the speed at which players consume game content, in addition to normal version scheduling, developers sometimes have to make many updates to the game; while players are actually very conflicted, on the one hand, they hate bugs and expect the game to provide more new modes, new heroes, new skins and other freshness, but when they open the game and face the “update” button that often amounts to several GB and the new version that needs to be adapted to, they feel a little irritable, “I just want to start a game quickly as usual.”</p>
<p>What is a good update frequency? Are AAA games that keep patching responsible or irresponsible to players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fb402fd13-e67e-4c32-a308-ae8af7b391d3.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many players have a headache every time they see a game that needs to be updated</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-Are-More-Frequent-Game-Updates-Better"><a href="#1-Are-More-Frequent-Game-Updates-Better" class="headerlink" title="1. Are More Frequent Game Updates Better?"></a>1. Are More Frequent Game Updates Better?</h2><p>Are more frequent game updates better? First of all, let’s get straight to the point: obviously not.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that players may not be able to keep up with the game’s update rhythm. For example, some MMORPGs make a major update every six months, introducing new levels. In this case, equipment from six months ago may be greatly devalued in six months. The advantage of this update is that it will give many players new motivation to make equipment and give many active players something to do; but for some players, this is a burden, because once they don’t play for a season, or for a new player who has just entered the game, it is difficult for them to catch up with the main group again.</p>
<p>In addition to such major updates, for some games, there may be some additional new content every two weeks. Game developers will attract you to go online within each update cycle and complete various tasks in a relatively short period of time, otherwise you will miss many event&#x2F;task rewards.</p>
<p>In addition, for some competitive games, too frequent updates will make the player’s learning cost rise sharply. If <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s combos are adjusted every month, it will be disastrous for the player’s experience. Because action games are very different from FPS or MOBA, there are combination combos in the game, as well as the combination of various movement techniques, and so on. These things require players to spend a lot of time learning in the training ground, so if we constantly update the habits of combos, then players need to constantly learn new techniques. If the “special skill” that has been practiced after spending a lot of time is just mastered and is weakened or directly unusable, it will only accelerate the loss of players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F0ed52437-397e-4e98-8116-1a463fa6018b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》’s new map design took a year</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, from the perspective of game developers, launching a new map, hero, or weapon requires a lot of manpower and time costs. For example, players often mention “wanting a new map”, but map design is often the most complex element in the game development process. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> launched a new map on its anniversary, which took about a year; while successful battle royale games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>PUBG</em> also take at least a year to launch a new map.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Find-the-Optimal-Solution-for-Update-Frequency"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-the-Optimal-Solution-for-Update-Frequency" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find the Optimal Solution for Update Frequency"></a>2. How to Find the Optimal Solution for Update Frequency</h2><p>If we want to find the potential optimal solution for the update frequency, then we must first understand the several ways of updating the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Event-based update:</strong> <em>DOTA2</em>, etc. This kind of game is often updated with major events as the node. Whether it is a major update or a minor update, it will try to avoid conflicts with the competition.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Season update system:</strong> <em>Apex Legends</em>, etc. Based on the season, each season will launch new BP, new heroes, and other times are just repairs and patches, without major changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Short-frequency update:</strong> <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, <em>Justice Online</em>, etc. Although these games are also divided into seasons, there will be new content online every 1~2 weeks. Relatively speaking, the frequency is relatively fixed, which is Thursday of a certain week.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Completely random update mode:</strong> Games like <em>CSGO</em>, the update is completely without any signs. For example, it was recently announced that <em>CS2</em> would be launched, and there was almost no sign before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F82d852ba-a1f9-4337-8e4d-a42a19446635.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《CS2》 is quietly going online</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After understanding the update mode, we can come to a rough conclusion: there is no best update rhythm, only the most suitable (for a certain game) update rhythm.</p>
<p>Each of the games mentioned above is an industry benchmark with a leading number of online users, and they have each chosen different update paths. For example, <em>CSGO</em>, this is a game that extremely relies on the muscle memory operation of “recoil control”, so they can’t always make drastic changes. Even when developers want to weaken or strengthen a gun, they do more to balance it by changing the price of the gun, changing the magazine capacity of the gun, and never always changing the trajectory of the gun. Games like <em>Apex Legends</em> that have more elements of Hero Shooters, plus its battle royale elements, is not like traditional shooters. It needs more maps, more heroes and other new elements to give players a sense of freshness and retain players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fec20fff2-eb01-4856-bc1c-fb93c0d2e6b1.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The hero launched in the new season of 《Apex Legends》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the unique attributes of games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>DOTA2</em> make it difficult for the game to achieve perfect balance. Even if “perfect balance” can be achieved in the early stage of the new version release, as time goes by, a super-large online game will eventually evolve more optimal solutions. They all start to adopt the same strategy, such as players choosing fixed heroes and fixed guns, which makes ordinary games or competitions boring, because many of the choices in the game are the same, then the only solution is to release updates to rebalance and change the existing optimal solution.</p>
<p>So, among so many game updates, how should the development team try to find this optimal solution and balance?</p>
<p>If the priority order of version updates is discussed from the perspective of the manufacturer, the first thing to consider is the urgency of the update points, such as major bugs with a large impact range or a deep impact. Let alone being arranged in the planned version update, some games sometimes even decide to use emergency updates to solve such problems; in addition to bugs, obvious experience problems mentioned by a relatively high proportion of players will generally increase in urgency and be placed in the most recent update.</p>
<p>Secondly, the depth of the impact of the problems presented by the game content is a reason for updates that the development team will refer to. For example, if the current consumption speed of game content is much slower or faster than originally planned, and the impact on all players, especially high-active users, is very deep, it is necessary to schedule high-priority updates. For another example, a certain piece of paid equipment does not meet the expectations of many players after it is installed, or its numerical bonus has a strong suppression effect on specific characters in PVP gameplay. Problems like this that have a large negative impact on a certain type of player group, such as paying players&#x2F;PVP players, should also be adjusted in the most recent update.</p>
<p>Of course, the above mentioned are just examples of factors that affect the update priority and update frequency. In the process of game project operation, there will still be many other modules that need to be considered. The development team should be with users at all times based on the characteristics of their own games, and combine information from the game’s own state, development schedule plan, and player feedback to continuously explore a more suitable update rhythm for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="3-Updates-for-Single-Player-Games"><a href="#3-Updates-for-Single-Player-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Updates for Single-Player Games"></a>3. Updates for Single-Player Games</h2><p>It is not only online games that have update problems, but the patches after the release of single-player games have become a hot topic among game players. In some recent games, many game developers and publishers have released “unfinished” games. For example, <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, which was just released at the end of last month, many players have had the honor of becoming “victims of the genuine game”, because the optimization of this game is really bad, and the player’s comments also reflect this. Many negative reviews are complaining about the optimization of the game, and even the popular IP of Star Wars can’t stop it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F0a12e4c9-8480-477e-afee-5766c250c5d9.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Some players think that the optimization of 《Star Wars Jedi: Survivor》 is not good</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, this is definitely not an isolated case. <em>The Last of Us</em>, released in March, is a game ported from PS to PC. A game released 10 years ago still has many optimization problems after being ported to PC, and it has been criticized. <em>FORSPOKEN</em>, which was released at the beginning of the year, has been released for 4 months now, and the optimization problem has not been solved yet. The 4090 graphics card will still drop frames and crash wildly in the game.</p>
<p>These are also masterpieces launched by the most well-known game manufacturers, Square Enix, Naughty Dog, and EA’s Respawn Entertainment, all of which are the top developers in the game industry. This makes some players curious, what happened to some AAA games now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F69d8c164-9845-42f5-8dc5-c0b4be3d266a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many of the flagship works of major manufacturers are also semi-finished products with poor optimization</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The way these big manufacturers solve optimization problems is also simple: patching. This goes back to the topic of “victims of genuine games” mentioned earlier. Some game developers are forced to launch games at a specific time within a limited budget and development time. For some optimization problems of the game, they decide to fix them all later. This seems to be an obvious “scam” in the eyes of some people, and it is difficult to be recognized by players. At least from the perspective of experience, it is very bad. Some players complain that this is equivalent to “paying full price at the beginning for a half-court game.”</p>
<p>Games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are also perfect examples. When it was first released, the content was very different from the promotional video, but the developer CDPR slowly filled in some of the content that was originally planned to be launched in the game. Now, although this game has saved a lot of reputation by relying on post-remediation, IP comics, etc., there are still some players who express their views and concerns about this phenomenon in forums and player communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F09652512-16f7-4e7a-a105-2d525c14be4a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Cyberpunk 2077》 is still trying to fix bugs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They will say, “Now there are too many game companies that sell incomplete games to players. Then there are patches on day 1, day 3, day 7… So many patches make the release of new games a death march. Planners and publishers make ridiculous decisions because they choose to fix it after release, ignoring the player experience.”</p>
<p>In fact, the feelings of these players should be understood. Some people have also revealed their hearts: “I hate the idea of regular patching to make up for mistakes, or regular patching for other defects caused by early game launches. Usually this means that the product is problematic, it means a bad player experience, it means it’s an incomplete game.”</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In fact, whether it is an online game or a AAA masterpiece, the frequency of updates is a matter of concern and headache for game manufacturers and players. For games of different categories, developers should always take the player’s voice into consideration and formulate the most suitable update rhythm based on their own characteristics. In recent years, some AAA games have collapsed in reputation after their launch, making some fans worried; however, as the impact of the epidemic gradually dissipates, the industry’s capital operations and mergers and acquisitions are more focused on the game products themselves, and the R&amp;D strategies of some developers are more centralized, we believe that the chances of seeing “incomplete games” will become less and less!</p>

    <title>Making Players Unable to Stop - The Role of the Zeigarnik Effect in Game Design</title>
    <url>/2023/07/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20230712_28584_1098338/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230712/28584_1098338.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may have had the following experiences: during an exam, you can clearly remember various key points and details, but after the exam, these details become blurred in your mind; you fill out a quiz in an H5, but are told to forward and share it to see the results; a variety show is about to announce the promotion results, but suddenly a commercial break appears, and you have to wait patiently for the commercial to finish before watching the results.</p>
<p>All of these cases are related to a psychological effect called the “Zeigarnik Effect,” and this theory is also applied to the experience design in the game field. This article will introduce the Zeigarnik Effect and its application examples in the game field, and discuss how designers can use the Zeigarnik Effect to attract players’ attention and make them “unable to stop.”</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive"><a href="#1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive"></a>1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive</h2><p>The Zeigarnik Effect states that humans have a drive to do things from beginning to end, and they have a strong motivation to complete unfinished tasks, and they focus more attention on these unfinished tasks. The reason why people forget completed work is because the motivation to complete it has been satisfied; if the work is not yet completed, the same motivation will make them have a deep impression of it, and their attention will tend to focus on it. Unfinished tasks that are interrupted midway are not only easy to recall, but also have a tendency to continue to be completed after other work has been done.</p>
<p>The reason why many games are addictive can be explained by the Zeigarnik Effect. Take <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> as an example. After the player determines a certain unactivated tower as the main goal, although they will deviate from the route to experience a lot of extra content (such as opening shrines, finding Korok seeds, and clearing enemy strongholds), they will generally continue to move towards the main goal.</p>
<p>When the player sets the destination at the starting point, the desire to complete has already been generated. Before the desire to complete this matter is satisfied, no matter what is done along the way, the player will still retain part of their attention on the main goal. Therefore, the rich exploration content along the way will not affect the basic goal. At the same time, the completion drive supports the player to continue moving forward until they reach the main goal. In this process, the Zeigarnik Effect plays a great role. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F856bbb76-9f47-4a2f-bec1-d57d275df169.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《The Legend of Zelda》: The content between one starting point and another tower is very rich, but it will not affect the player’s final arrival at the main goal.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Since the Zeigarnik Effect can effectively focus people’s attention on specific events and spontaneously generate a strong completion drive, designers can fully utilize this effect to make players’ intentions more easily aligned with design goals. Next, we will introduce some design methods and points to note that allow the Zeigarnik Effect to work.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive"><a href="#2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive"></a>2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive</h2><h3 id="Visualized-Progress-Incentive"><a href="#Visualized-Progress-Incentive" class="headerlink" title="Visualized Progress Incentive"></a>Visualized Progress Incentive</h3><p>Providing clear and transparent progress prompts can make players aware of their current completed progress and the remaining amount of tasks to be completed. The certainty brought by this transparent progress information can make players more confident in the task process, thereby having a higher completion drive. There are many ways to express progress information, and visualizing progress information is an efficient and widely used way of conveying information.</p>
<p>For example, in the 3D platform jumping game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, at the beginning of each level, players are told the number of Moons needed to pass the level, and the target number of Moons and the number currently obtained are clearly marked in the HUD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Ff50cd137-505f-49df-8d0e-27744e0a7584.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Super Mario Odyssey》 In-game HUD: How many more Moons the player needs to collect is clearly marked.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In some special situations, clear progress information may play a stronger positive encouraging role. <em>Cuphead</em> is a 2D platform jumping shooting game known for its high difficulty. Its high challenge not only does not discourage a large number of players, but players may even become more frustrated and even addicted in the process of continuous challenge failures, and some design details in the game play a boosting role. For example, the settlement interface where players fail the challenge in the game will display the level position reached in this round, allowing players to clearly see the completed level progress and the remaining level progress. In the boss level, they can also see the boss stage markers that have the same function as milestones, which can effectively encourage players to re-challenge this level; especially when the player is close to the finish line, they will have a stronger completion drive.</p>
<p>The following is the failure interface of <em>Cuphead</em> (the top is the original interface, the bottom is the interface without the level progress bar): Imagine if you see the interface below every time you fail, is it easier to lose your goal and even give up the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F58abcf77-ffd1-43e1-a133-03cfe6854128.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F24ef2fbc-9d2f-471d-97fc-eb23a4d043dc.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, the expression of progress information can also try to use interesting gameplay for packaging. <em>The Tiny Bang Story</em> is a level-based puzzle game with item finding and collection as the main gameplay. Jigsaw puzzles are a kind of level collection in the game. At the end of each level, players will enter a jigsaw puzzle mini-game interface. Each level can get fragments and complete part of the jigsaw puzzle by themselves. When the jigsaw puzzle is completely completed, the game is cleared. The developer uses the jigsaw puzzle gameplay combined with the game’s worldview to package the game progress in an interesting way. Each completed jigsaw puzzle part corresponds to the level map that has just passed. Players can roughly judge the game progress through the area of the unfinished jigsaw puzzle. This kind of level ending interface that is both ritualistic and interesting can leave a deeper impression. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F7e023bba-40d7-4753-8223-cebcfa2b1e66.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<h3 id="Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks"><a href="#Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks"></a>Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks</h3><p>To make it easier for players to advance the task flow, large tasks can be broken down into small tasks. This design will reduce the perceived workload of players and make them more likely to put in effort. The character creation process of <em>Biomutant</em> is relatively complicated. If all functions are arranged in the same interface by switching tabs, it may cause certain pressure on players. Therefore, in the game, these pre-settings are divided into several small steps, allowing players to choose to focus on the content of the current page or directly generate it randomly, so that it is not easy to think that these processes are too cumbersome and leave a bad experience impression. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F9b531f86-a440-4d93-a5d4-0c7be49fbbab.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F934d4d94-e200-4621-825d-b5d7e7544338.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Biomutant》 Character creation process (the picture below is an early real machine demonstration screen, you can see the clear step progress)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The same design can also be seen in the mandatory feature demonstration process of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. This process briefly shows players several new features of the controller before players officially enter the game. The designer breaks down all new features into five experience steps so that players can focus on experiencing the current feature in turn, rather than feeling overwhelmed by a bunch of new features and ending the experience hastily. </p>

<p>In <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, there is a casual gameplay called Bamboo Strike Challenge. Players need to quickly press the buttons in sequence according to the button sequence instructions on the screen to complete the bamboo cutting. The condition for a successful challenge is that the player quickly presses 7 buttons in sequence. In this challenge task, the player’s completion motivation is very clear, but it is difficult to master the clicking sequence of these seven buttons at once and press them quickly. The player’s completion drive is likely to be suppressed in frustration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge is generally divided into three gradual steps. In the first step, players only need to complete the bamboo cutting of three buttons, which is very simple; the second step adds two button presses on the basis of the first step. Players have basically mastered the method of quickly pressing five buttons here, and have already satisfied the desire to complete the first two steps; the third step is based on the second step. Two more buttons are added on the basis of the step. This step is very challenging, but because of the practice in the first two steps, players will be more likely to master the skills. At the same time, because they are close to completing the goal, the player’s motivation to complete will be stronger, and the possibility of persisting in completing the challenge will be higher. </p>

<h3 id="Artificial-Advancement-Effect"><a href="#Artificial-Advancement-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Advancement Effect"></a>Artificial Advancement Effect</h3><p>To better stimulate the player’s completion drive, designers can also try to let players regard the task as “unfinished” rather than “not started”. Here, another psychological term that is often mentioned along with the Zeigarnik Effect is introduced - the Artificial Advancement Effect. The Artificial Advancement Effect is also related to strengthening the drive for action. This theory states that if a person is artificially provided with some progress towards achieving a goal, that person will be more motivated to complete the goal.</p>
<p>A classic example is the car wash membership card experiment. In the experiment, researchers distributed two types of cards with stamps to exchange for free car wash opportunities, but one of them had eight empty stamp spaces, and the other had two stamped spaces and eight empty stamp spaces. Theoretically speaking, both types of cards need to collect 8 more stamps to get a car wash opportunity. But after nine months, 19% of those with the first type of card successfully redeemed the car wash opportunity, while as many as 34% of the latter redeemed the car wash opportunity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F3a29f546-5ee6-4042-9073-1f16a33f4836.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the “Celestial Weaver” appearance extraction interface of <em>Revelation M</em>, players can get a free extraction opportunity every day. We can try to analyze this reward distribution method from the perspective of the Zeigarnik Effect: First, this extraction opportunity breaks the player’s impression of the current cycle of extraction progress as “not started”. Secondly, the progress reward of the prize pool becomes a state of “unfinished”, thereby stimulating the player’s desire and drive to complete the progress reward. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fa2ad06dc-2315-4104-a615-6fb1db29fa47.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Goal-Gradient-Effect"><a href="#Goal-Gradient-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Goal Gradient Effect"></a>Goal Gradient Effect</h3><p>In addition, the psychological effect closely related to the Zeigarnik Effect is the Goal Gradient Effect. Using the Goal Gradient Effect can also better mobilize the player’s completion drive. The Goal Gradient Effect means that when a person is close to the goal, the drive for action will be stronger. At this time, the manifestation of the enhanced drive for action is to accelerate their own actions in order to reach the goal faster, and to be willing to spend more costs to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>The application of the Goal Gradient Effect on the interface is not uncommon. The more familiar case should be the progress bars of various APPs that are stuck at 99% and difficult to continue. The first 99% is accumulated effortlessly. Compared with the so-called 99% sunk cost, users care more about the last 1% that seems to be within reach. This “fake” progress bar can make users willing to invest more time and effectively enhance users’ willingness to continue waiting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F29ffea0e-0d7e-4f70-833c-63c0a442d729.png/size/"></p>
<p>In some games, design details can be seen where designers use progress prompts to enhance players’ drive for action. For example, in the physics-based puzzle game <em>World of Goo</em>, every time the player builds, if they are closer to the end pipe opening, it will trigger a “xx meters left” text feedback. This progress prompt will make the player’s completion drive stronger the closer they get to the pipe opening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F2a1fccfc-b2ad-4ef4-ac40-faeced9b069e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《World of Goo》 Distance prompt</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is a similar design in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. The player’s rank promotion is represented by a circular progress bar and an iconized level to express the player’s current level and the progress of this level. In addition, the estimated time cost required for promotion is also specially marked. When the completion cost is within the player’s acceptable range, it is easier to stimulate their completion drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fd0706694-f304-47a0-ad29-fa7824668141.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Positive-Feedback"><a href="#Positive-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Positive Feedback"></a>Positive Feedback</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the Zeigarnik Effect achieves the effect of deepening impression and attracting attention through the player’s unfulfilled desire to complete. Although players can obtain a certain amount of mental pleasure through the satisfaction of the desire to complete, designers still need to pay attention to giving players positive feedback at the right time during the task process to avoid leaving an overall negative feeling greater than the positive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F8ba84e12-abc1-4d1f-818f-9190d8fa5cf4.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In summary, experience design can utilize visualized progress incentives, task decomposition, the Artificial Advancement Effect, the Goal Gradient Effect, and appropriate positive feedback, etc., to make the Zeigarnik Effect play a better role. But no matter what the designer does, it is to guide the player to more easily reach agreement with the design goal and help the player better complete each game goal. The fundamental purpose is always to allow players to have a better gaming experience.</p>

    <title>Meaning and Rhythm in Games How Poetry Localization Empowers Text</title>
    <url>/2023/07/13/netease-ux-articles/news_20230717_28584_1099119/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230717/28584_1099119.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For game players or poetry readers, games and poetry are not conventionally compatible art forms.</p>
<p>After all, most poetry expresses serious themes, often involving poets’ reflections on life, death, emotions, and landscapes, or their deepest cries and expressions. Games, on the other hand, seem like a relatively simpler, more direct form of entertainment.</p>
<p>But from an artistic perspective, games are very much like a melting pot. Whether it’s text or images, static or dynamic, once melted into the game, its artistic form becomes multi-dimensional, and its expression becomes diverse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the former, an ancient and solitary art, is revitalized by merging with a new and lively art form.</p>
<h2 id="1-Poetry-and-Games"><a href="#1-Poetry-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Poetry and Games"></a>1. Poetry and Games</h2><p>Although they are very different fields, in some ways, isn’t writing poetry a kind of word game? Burying meaning, arranging and rhyming, exquisite deliberation, design, and revision, mirrors the process of creating a game.</p>
<p>Similarly, games can be created and expressed in a poetic way.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Royal Festival Hall in London hosted an exhibition by the National Poetry Library called “Poetry Games”. In the exhibition, people could create their own poems through block games. Murray, the organizer of the exhibition, hoped to attract people who are not very fond of entering the poetry library but are familiar with the language of games, to weaken the image of poetry as obscure and difficult to understand in textbooks. People may simply be playing games, and then suddenly burst into inspiration, find that poetry is actually very interesting, and unconsciously write down words. He also mentioned that now all art forms are learning from games, and poetry should do the same.</p>
<p>Indeed, various art forms are already on the road to integration with games.</p>
<p>So when we look at it from the other side, the end of the road, many games themselves are already embedded with rich poetry and poetic language. In <em>Fallout</em>, if the player hacks the terminal of the ghoul Tulip, they can read John Milton’s 17th-century British epic <em>Paradise Lost</em>. In <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, there are more than 73 poems, songs, and letters, which have even been compiled into a website system for enthusiasts to consult. It can be described as a literary and poetic feast originating from the game.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the game world of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, an epic poem called “Loveless” tells the story of three men searching for the legendary “Gift of the Goddess”. This poem has made several cameos in the game’s compilation and was later adapted into a musical stage play. There is also a street named after it in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to directly presenting complete poems, many games have also found other ways to integrate poetry. For example, in the game <em>Wayfinder</em>, players need to control characters to wander in a beautiful world full of poetry, collect fragmented words, and finally compile them into complete fragments to create a poem about the land the protagonist is exploring. Another example is a fantasy adventure game called <em>Elegy for a Dead World</em>, which takes players into landscapes inspired by the poems of Shelley, Keats, and Byron, and then guides them to write directly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2Fb2d0d32f-4db1-4935-891c-bf068657c81a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Elegy for a Dead World》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A more direct creation is Ross Sutherland, the producer of <em>Street Fighter II</em>, who released original sonnets based on Street Fighter on National Poetry Day, depicting and creating a new mythical world composed of 12 heroes from Street Fighter.</p>
<p>Therefore, although niche, cultural art forms such as poetry have quietly infiltrated the game content production process in a quiet and special way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry"><a href="#2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry" class="headerlink" title="2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry"></a>2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry</h2><p>If we call the combination of poetry and games a bold fusion, then the localization of poetry in games is like a kind mother who has to tolerate the waywardness of children.</p>
<p>When faced with the expressive desire of poetry in games and its hidden cultural heritage, how to retain the original meaning and emotion of the poem, reflect the rhythm and language style of the poem, and also consider the target language, cultural characteristics, and the acceptance of the audience, is a challenge that every worker in the localization process needs to think deeply about and overcome.</p>
<p>Taking <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> mentioned above as an example, the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game has become an ancient legendary poem widely sung in the game’s story background with its smooth rhythm and simple arrangement. Some clumsy and absurd jokes and names have been specially added to the simple chanting rhythm to highlight how ridiculous it is that a rookie alchemist obtained a potion that made him smart in a pure accident.</p>
<p>Although the English version of the “Song of the Alchemists” uses simple words, the rhythm is interlocking. It starts with end rhyme, interestingly unfolding the beginning of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When King Maraneon’s alchemist had to leave his station</p>
<p>After a laboratory experiment that yielded detonation,</p>
<p>The word went out that the King did want</p>
<p>A new savant</p>
<p>To mix his potions and brews.</p>
<p>But he declared he would only choose</p>
<p>A fellow who knew the tricks and the tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation uses words such as “开除 (kāi chú - fired)”, “缘故 (yuán gù - reason)”, and “奴仆 (nú pú - servant)” to retain the pronunciation of “brews” and “choose” in English, completing the end rhyme and promoting the easy-to-sing characteristic of this poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>国王马兰尼恩的炼金术士被<strong>开除</strong></p>
<p>由于他的实验室爆炸了的<strong>缘故</strong></p>
<p>国王诏令要新的<strong>奴仆</strong></p>
<p>为他配置药水和药物</p>
<p>但他只要一个人</p>
<p>能熟练掌握炼金术的技巧和工具的用途</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the more difficult combination of alliteration + end rhyme, Chinese loses some of its color. For example, in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much deliberation, discussions, and debates,</p>
<p>The King picked two well-learned candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text has both alliteration of “deliberation, discussions, and debates” and the echo of end rhyme of “debates and candidates”. The Chinese version can only be translated literally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>通过大量的考虑、讨论、辩争</p>
<p>国王最后选了两位有才的候选人</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is related to the characteristics of the language itself. It is indeed difficult for Chinese to achieve both meaning, alliteration, and end rhyme, and to be fluent and rhythmic. However, the use of written language like “通过大量的考虑 (tōng guò dà liàng de kǎo lǜ - through a lot of consideration)” in poetry seems abrupt and awkward. Therefore, from the perspective of whether it conforms to the characteristics of “easy to sing”, “narrative”, “rhythm” and “teasing” of the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game, although this Chinese localized text has some processing that fits the original text, it has not been further scrutinized.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the game <em>The Witcher 3</em>, players can also come into contact with many ancient poems, including original poems based on the game’s background story, as well as excellent works from the Middle Ages. For example, the quote from the Ladies of the Wood in the game is taken from the original text of Act 1, Scene 3 of <em>Macbeth</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land, thus do go about, about: thrice to thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text is precise and powerful, not only in rhythm, but also in syllables and format.</p>
<p>For example, “Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land” is a perfect introductory sentence in terms of format, with both smooth syllable arrangement and rhythmic echo. Moreover, “thrice”, “thine”, “mine” and “nine” appear alternately, making the rhythm of the poem like undulating peaks, giving readers a repeated and enjoyable singing.</p>
<p>Looking at the text alone, players or readers may find it difficult to understand. But in connection with the image of the Ladies of the Wood in the game, the mystery of this text can be broken.</p>
<p>There are three Ladies of the Wood, namely Weavess, Brewess, and Whispess, and their powerful magic comes from the land. For the local residents, they are both gods to rely on and demons that take lives. On the one hand, the Ladies of the Wood reward devout believers who offer sacrifices, eliminate the disasters and difficulties they face, and help the villagers through difficult times; on the other hand, they demand absolute obedience from believers and occasionally require villagers to sacrifice their hair, ears, or even their children.</p>
<p>Moreover, not everyone can see the three ladies: most people can only participate in the dinner at the campfire at the foot of the mountain, and the ladies will select beautiful guests who satisfy them from these people, usually three, and then these young men and women will go up to the mountain to spend the night with them. When these three young men and women come back, they never mention what happened at the night meeting, and even forget their past, just full of joy, as if they were reborn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2F09b586db-7b77-4bde-8fef-0dffe49440ce.png/size/"></p>
<p>With the background story of the game in mind, in the existing translations, we can read Zhu Shenghao’s translation of this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>沧海高山弹指地，朝飞暮返害人命，</p>
<p>姐三巡，妹三巡，三三九转蛊方成。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation also starts with a similar syllable arrangement of “三姐妹，手牵手 (sān jiě mèi, shǒu qiān shǒu - three sisters, hand in hand)”, successfully continuing the jingle-like introduction of the original text. At the same time, the translation also shows the powerful and dialectical abilities of the three sisters: they can both overturn the world and possibly harm people’s lives. In addition to the end rhyme of “地 (dì - land)” and “命 (mìng - life)”, the translation cleverly replaces the “you” and “me” of the original text with “姐三巡，妹三巡 (jiě sān xún, mèi sān xún - sister three rounds, sister three rounds)”, which not only conforms to the meaning of the original text, but also achieves rhyme again and reproduces the poetic and chanting sense.</p>
<p>However, the actual Chinese localization of <em>The Witcher 3</em> game is much inferior to this translation. The traditional Chinese version of the text not only loses the syllable arrangement, but also makes the poem seem like many unordered dancers running around on the stage due to literal translation and the combination of uncommon sentence patterns. There is no rhythm, no music, and no lighting rehearsal, presenting a strange dance performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>老巫妪，三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>穿梭海陆，吓破人胆，如此前进，</p>
<p>三次我，三次你，又三次，总共九。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence “老巫妪，三姐妹 (lǎo wū yù, sān jiě mèi - old crones, three sisters)” is awkward as the opening sentence, and although “手牵手 (shǒu qiān shǒu - hand in hand)” and “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” have sentence structure and end rhyme, the long sentence in the middle has already fragmented the rhythm. “三次我，三次你 (sān cì wǒ, sān cì nǐ - thrice me, thrice you)” is also a completely literal translation. From the perspective of Chinese, readers simply cannot understand the meaning. Similarly, “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” is also like an incomplete sentence, which not only does not conform to Chinese sentence habits, but also fails to express any meaning. Even after reading the whole text, it does not help to understand the image and status of the Ladies of the Wood in the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games"><a href="#3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games"></a>3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games</h2><p>The translation and localization of poetry and cultural content in games is crucial to the success and market expansion of games. However, this translation and localization also face many challenges, requiring the knowledge base and in-depth understanding of translators and localization teams. In the process of translation and localization, it is necessary to balance the original meaning and cultural differences, and to consider the acceptance of the readers.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality and efficiency of poetry translation and localization, professional translation and localization aids can be used, clear standards can be formulated, and cultural experts can be cooperated with for review and testing.</p>
<p>For example, in the localization process of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, for short but very rhythmic poetry texts, we usually deal with them as English sentences that conform to rhyme and are catchy. For example, the description text of the costume [Spring Snow]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>碎雪浮青叶，风暖春无垠。</p>
<p>(Fragmented snow floats on green leaves, the wind is warm and spring is boundless.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the basis of neat Chinese characters and smooth rhythm, English also uses end rhyme to show a beautiful scene of spring and melting snow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spring comes with the warm breeze, snow melted then appear the leaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, for some poems and classical Chinese texts that introduce the background story, the primary task of localization is not to rhyme and promote its literary nature, but to be easy to understand and break down cultural barriers.</p>
<p>For example, in the <em>Journey to the West</em> series of appearances, the game quotes the original text of <em>Journey to the West</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>混元体正合先天，万劫千番只自然。</p>
<p>(The primordial body is in harmony with nature, and thousands of eons are just natural.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If too much of the artistic conception that Chinese wants to express is retained here, the translation will become extremely lengthy and lose the original form and meaning of the poem. Therefore, after referring to Anthony C. Yu’s authoritative translation, it is handled here as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cosmic being fully fused with nature’s gifts.</p>
<p>Passes with ease through ten thousand toils and tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2F8d30fbc7-f1be-4e1d-8c39-3d64c3bbde2c.png/size/"></p>
<p>After making trade-offs in the expression of the text and shortening the wording, the words “混元 (hùn yuán - primordial)”, “先天 (xiān tiān - innate)”, and “劫 (jié - eon)” with strong cultural imagery in Chinese poetry are stripped of their mystery, eliminating the unnecessary burden of understanding, expressing the original meaning more directly, and ensuring the neatness and brevity of the sentence structure.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Cultural differences are a wayward and naughty child in the development of various artistic works. It is wanton, slick, and the barriers it forms often hinder the spread of many excellent works.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the continuous expansion of the game market and the trend of globalization, the localization of poetry in games will become a novel and complex topic. Game developers and localization personnel need to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies and trends to meet the needs of players from different countries and cultural backgrounds, break down cultural barriers, and reduce the difficulty of understanding; at the same time, they also need to continue to pay attention to balancing the original meaning and cultural differences, and consider the acceptance of readers to provide a better gaming experience. In this process, the localization team should work closely together and make joint efforts to become a strong communicator and trailblazer for players in the game world.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230724/28584_1100412.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the era of rapid development of information technology and globalization, as the influence of games on the economy and society continues to increase, it is also increasingly changing the composition of the culture and entertainment industries. Under this premise, esports has emerged as a new competitive mode, gradually becoming one of the most promising fields in the world from its initial niche status. In the emerging South American game market in recent years, the esports industry in Brazil is particularly prosperous. It has hosted many esports exhibitions and attracted investment and sponsorship from many large European and American manufacturers.</p>
<p>Why is esports so popular in Brazil? What are the characteristics of esports development here? What level have Brazilian professional teams reached in this industry? Let’s explore the answers to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends"><a href="#1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends" class="headerlink" title="1. Esports Market and Development Trends"></a>1. Esports Market and Development Trends</h2><p>In 2019, among Brazil’s total population of 210 million, there were 75.7 million game players, close to 36% of the total population.</p>
<p>In 2020, Brazil became the country with the fourth largest number of esports viewers in the world, second only to India, China, and the United States. In addition, in Brazil, the recognition that “esports is a sports event” reached 53%, ranking first in the world. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F6d0abd13-429c-4a22-86d8-183aaa707422.png/size/" alt="PwC Data on Brazil&#39;s Esports Market"></p>
<p>According to a survey by PwC, in 2021, the total revenue of video games and esports in Brazil was approximately US$1.4 billion, surpassing Mexico to become the largest market in Latin America. The survey also showed that this figure is expected to reach US$2.8 billion by 2026, which is double in less than five years, accounting for 47.4% of the total revenue of games and esports in Latin America. According to SiGMA statistics, in esports alone, Brazil’s revenue is expected to reach US$16.03 million in 2023 and maintain a compound annual growth rate of 7.75% by 2027.</p>
<p>In terms of game preferences, Newzoo pointed out that although Brazilian users are closer to North American countries, Brazilians prefer shooting, racing, sports, and strategy mobile games. In addition, games with social attributes are also very popular among Latin American players. Therefore, Brazilian teams are also active in esports events of these game types. Brazilian teams can be seen in many major esports projects such as <em>CS:GO</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>.</p>
<p>In the list of the most discussed esports players in the first half of 2022, Brazilian players occupied three of the top ten. In the top ten list of esports clubs, Brazilian clubs occupied four. In 2022, 4,352 Brazilians received a total of US$47 million in prize money from 3,275 competitions, making the country rank seventh in the world in esports profitability.</p>
<h2 id="2-Sports-and-Esports"><a href="#2-Sports-and-Esports" class="headerlink" title="2. Sports and Esports"></a>2. Sports and Esports</h2><p>Speaking of sports, when it comes to Brazil, “football” must be the first word that most people think of. In fact, in addition to football, volleyball is also their strength. The Brazilian women’s volleyball team has always been a strong opponent of the Chinese women’s volleyball team. In other sports, Brazilians have also left their mark. Surfing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and racing are all their strengths. Long-term sports experience has also spawned Brazil’s unique competitive culture, making Brazilians highly receptive to esports projects.</p>
<p>Brazilian players like the two-sided competition mode from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, in this country, esports is also becoming a national sport like football. With no well-known game manufacturers in the country, the Brazilian esports market is still maintaining a healthy development trend. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional sports events were cancelled or suspended, which also allowed esports to develop at a higher speed as an alternative entertainment option. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F9ef84033-7b32-4919-ae76-5b3f45fc4c88.jpg/size/" alt="Brazilian Esports Spectators"></p>
<p>In MOBA esports projects such as <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Dota</em>, which require more strategy, Brazilians perform relatively conservatively; while FPS projects, which require more instinct and motor nerves, are the areas where they shine. The glory of the Brazilian team in FPS can be traced back to 2006. At that time, at the World Cyber Games (WCG), Chinese player Sky won the championship of the <em>Warcraft III</em> project for the second time, while the mibr team from Brazil won the championship of the <em>CS 1.6</em> project, creating a glorious moment for Brazil. Until 2022, Brazil also became the only country to win the biggest championship in the three major mainstream tactical shooting games.</p>
<p>The deep integration of Brazilian esports and traditional sports is also relatively rare in other countries. The fans of both sides highly overlap in identity and are very enthusiastic about participation. The culture of traditional sports is introduced into esports by fans, which is fully reflected in last year’s “CS:GO Rio Major”. Brazilian fans brought jerseys, drums and even fireworks to the closed stadium. The stadium was filled with drums, the uniform cheers of fans and the pervasive smoke, making people feel like they were in a crazy Brazilian football stadium. This Major attracted more than 1.5 million people to watch online at the same time, setting a new record for <em>CS:GO</em> competitions. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F6d6f8804-cf7c-4bea-9a7d-174d228fc3de.jpg/size/" alt="CS:GO Rio Major"></p>
<p>The enthusiasm of Brazilian football stars for esports has also encouraged more fans. Brazil’s top star Neymar is an FPS expert. <em>PUBG</em> and <em>CS:GO</em> are his favorite game projects. During the <em>CS:GO</em> Rio Major, the football superstar watched the game of the local team FURIA with his friends at home, and cheered for it on his personal social media. <em>PUBG</em>‘s developer KRAFTON did not miss the opportunity to cooperate with Neymar for marketing. In 2022, Neymar officially became the official publicity ambassador of <em>PUBG</em>, and KRAFTON also focused on expanding in the Americas. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fec08802c-3740-4040-a3d8-4b01507a0269.png/size/" alt="Brazilian Football Stars and FURIA"></p>
<p>Four Brazilian national team players put on the jerseys of the FURIA team (from left: Casemiro, Neymar, Paquetá, Arthur)</p>
<p>Many football clubs in Brazil are also actively participating in the esports industry. The famous club Flamengo is one of them. The team is very famous in Brazil and has the largest number of fans in Brazil, with about 13 million supporters. Its esports club, Flamengo eSports, won the second season of the 2019 CBLoL (<em>League of Legends</em> Brazilian League). In addition, Neymar’s old club, the famous football club Santos, also established its own Santos esports team in July 2018 after three years of cooperation with Dexterity Team.</p>
<p>Thanks to the high integration of football and esports, Brazilian esports teams are also performing well in the <em>FIFA</em> series. In the “FIFA22 eNations Cup” hosted by EA SPORTS, the Brazilian team defeated the Spanish team, the Italian team, and the defending champion French team in one fell swoop to win the championship.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports"><a href="#3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports" class="headerlink" title="3. The Unique Favela Esports"></a>3. The Unique Favela Esports</h2><p>Brazil has always been a country with a large slum population. World Bank data shows that in 2016, the slum population of various cities in Brazil accounted for 15% of the total population. Rio de Janeiro alone has nearly 1.5 million people living in slums, more than 20% of the city’s population. And Brazil’s various slums have always been a major source of competitive talent. Football superstars such as Pelé and Ronaldo grew up in slums.</p>
<p>However, for young people in slums, the threshold of esports is much higher than that of football. The high cost of equipment and internet makes it impossible for many young people who are interested in games to participate in this competition.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Brazil’s slums are also undergoing a digital transformation. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F7963c4fb-d957-408a-9849-77476ef68cfb.png/size/" alt="AfroGames Esports Center"></p>
<p>In 2019, with the promotion of the Rio esports charity AfroGames, Brazil established the world’s first esports center in a slum. AfroGames personnel once said, “We realized that only children from the middle and upper classes can afford esports activities. In an esports environment dominated by whites and Asians, AfroGames hopes to help change the status quo of our country by creating such a project”.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also esports clubs like Zero Gravity that only sign low-income young people from slums.</p>
<p>Esports events for young people in slums, such as the Favelas Cup and the Favelas Bowl, also provide opportunities for players who need financial support to win prize money.</p>
<p>The Favelas Cup and Favelas Bowl use the tactical competitive mobile game <em>Free Fire</em> as the competition project, and are open to slum players across Brazil. In the 2020 Favelas Cup, the Central Única das Favelas (CUFA) selected 48 participating teams from the slums of 26 states and federal districts in Brazil, 12 of which entered the finals. The total viewing time of the finals live broadcast reached 290,000 hours.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to reach most of Brazil’s poor communities, provide esports competitions, and encourage children and teenagers to enter the world of technology and innovation,” said Tifanny Nayara, the hostess and anchor of the Favelas Cup. According to her, the Favelas Cup reached “about 100 slums, 200 registered teams and a total of 800 players across the country.” With such widespread dissemination, more and more young people in Brazil hope to change their destiny through esports and get the opportunity to get out of the slums.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In Brazil’s strong esports atmosphere, holding esports events has undoubtedly become an important way for Chinese companies going overseas to expand their influence.</p>
<p>Due to the expensive price of consoles and PCs in the local area, it is obvious that ordinary Brazilian players prefer mobile games. Therefore, many manufacturers choose to use mobile game events as an entry point when deploying the Brazilian market, so that products can quickly enter the vision of the majority of ordinary people and even slum players, and use simple and direct publicity models to trigger the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Discord player community of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we often see players’ expectations and discussions about event activities. Even the Naraka: Bladepoint Pro League (NBPL) for mainland China can attract Brazilian KOLs to live broadcast and explain to players through Twitch.</p>
<p>It is foreseeable that if new overseas games in the future, especially mobile games, are released to the Brazilian market, being able to launch independent South American or Brazilian events will definitely trigger greater enthusiasm from players. The Brazilian players’ aggressive style of play in the competition will also make sports and FPS esports events more enjoyable, further attracting a large esports audience and achieving the diversion and promotion of new games.</p>

<h2 id="1-What-is-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#1-What-is-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Skeuomorphic Design?"></a>1. What is Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphism is a form of materializing information, also known as realism. A common method is to simulate the style of real-world objects in the interface, pursuing extreme textures and light and shadow, but it can also imitate the user’s familiar operation methods. By materializing information, it improves the efficiency of people’s information understanding, reduces learning costs, and allows users to become familiar with the interface faster.</p>
<p>In games, a large number of skeuomorphic designs can not only present a more refined interface, but also fully mobilize the player’s sense of intimacy and substitution for the game, and the sense of immersion is even better. Therefore, we can often see the application of skeuomorphic design in games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F50d7c80c-ba92-4082-8905-d38be6c573e4.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Characteristics of Skeuomorphic Design</h3><ul>
<li><strong>More intuitive</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By combining information with real objects familiar to players, the presentation of information can be more intuitive and efficient. In <em>Sifu</em>, the game’s worldview and storyline are presented in the form of a collage, allowing players to see the plot at a glance, intuitively view and understand the development of the plot. The whole process is not only in line with the player’s cognition, but also allows players to better substitute into the story presented in front of them, and the information presented in the interface is also very intuitive and clear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F151a2919-d0a2-4471-bd6b-4f55f445e970.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to accept</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On an emotional level, skeuomorphic design makes it easier for players to accept and reduces the player’s learning cost. The design of the sign-in page of <em>Onmyoji: The Card Game</em> is presented in the form of a wishing wind chime. The interface is simple and clear, which not only conforms to the player’s cognition, making it easier for players to complete the sign-in process, but also allows players to complete fortune-telling during the sign-in, making it easier to understand and accept, and improving the sign-in rate from a design perspective. </p>

<h3 id="Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Risks of Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Risks of Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphic design can create a realistic worldview scene in the game, strengthen the atmosphere of the game by simulating objects, and enhance the player’s psychological and emotional substitution. It can be said that skeuomorphic design is one of the preferred methods for game interface design. However, with the continuous enrichment of game interface information, it is difficult to present a large amount of interface information by simply using skeuomorphic design, and it is also difficult to control the layout and hierarchy of information. To a certain extent, it may put the cart before the horse. If used improperly, a clear interaction path cannot be achieved.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?"></a>2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design in games is very beneficial to both the game itself and the players, so we often find such designs in games. Specifically, we can explore from two aspects:</p>
<h3 id="Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface"><a href="#Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Improve the Quality of the Game Interface"></a>Improve the Quality of the Game Interface</h3><p>On the one hand, for the game itself, the design of the skeuomorphic interface can combine the interface with simulated real elements and carry out artistic processing to form an interface design that meets the psychological needs of players. Through skeuomorphic design, it enhances the efficient matching of game interface information. At the same time, the exquisite and artistic design can also enhance the quality of the interface, easily express the theme of the work, and integrate with the game world. </p>

In <em>The Last of Us</em>, the information is connected with the game plot scene, and the map is placed in the player’s audience and scene. This skeuomorphic method is used to enhance the player’s sense of substitution and immersion. </p>

How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?"></a>3. How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design can make the game interface more vivid, but if it is not designed properly, it will also lead to low adaptability, interface discordance, inability to present effective information, and other problems. Therefore, in the process of skeuomorphic design, designers should pay attention to:</p>
<h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality"></a>Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality</h3><p>The skeuomorphic interface design should simulate object elements that are more in line with the player’s psychological cognition, reduce learning costs, and allow players to naturally integrate into the game. In the interface design of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, the game combines the collection of cars with the display form of menus, allowing players to view the collected models by flipping through different menus. Through the element form of the real menu, players are more receptive to the collection of items, and the presentation of the interface is also more vivid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F2b11bb7a-ce70-47a3-8285-1a3d40d35f96.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Gran Turismo 7》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the skill page of <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, the overall interface is designed in the form of stone rubbings, making the overall interface present a heavy effect. Players are like carving on a slate when upgrading skills and equipment, creating a more realistic feeling. In the equipment interface, each weapon has its own exclusive skeuomorphic background. For example, the Blades of Chaos uses the texture of the blade and lava to show the weapon characteristics; while the UI background of the Leviathan Axe shows the frozen attributes. Such a design helps players have a more intuitive and clear understanding of the weapon’s attributes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F9e09de5b-1dd9-48f4-b292-96b85a3becd5.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fe6786c28-1cda-463b-ba63-644b8d2c177a.png/size/"></p>

The yellowish letters and books reflect the mysterious and retro magical colors in the game, and also conform to the background of the times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5bcb1245-f1af-4e3e-b52e-9edf17c88b33.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Hogwarts Legacy》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, a skeuomorphic design that is very consistent with the theme of the game is also selected. In the interface, the form of Atreus’s old books, notebooks, and sketches is used to show the characters, worldview, plot, etc. of the game, which not only fits the theme of the game, but also strengthens the texture and style of the game, rendering the immersive atmosphere of the player’s game. Players are like opening a notepad, reading their own past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fba6c00d9-bb77-4edd-8d9c-ab067b719bed.jpg/size/"></p>

<p><em>The Sinking City</em> also uses the elements of old and damaged notebooks, which fits the theme of detective games. The yellowish notebook shows various information in the game, allowing players to feel full of suspense and enhance the player’s detective experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F475a2e02-5e5f-485e-8478-d6d7fcd13bf4.png/size/"></p>

In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the game combines the interface for purchasing items with the scene, allowing players to complete the purchase of items by flipping through the books in the scene, as if they were cowboys in that era, using ancient methods to obtain information about guns, and then selecting and placing orders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5d740af2-4c45-4442-9aef-02dfb470fa89.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, the interface information is very cleverly combined with the items in the game, and the information prompts are integrated into the scene. The scattering of dandelion text brings a good visual experience to the player. Integrating the interface into the scene cannot appear isolated and abrupt, but should be designed in combination with the current scene, gameplay, etc. of the game, so that this combination is not far-fetched and does not jump out of the scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F397fa426-0c58-407a-86ab-8d66496fd565.png/size/"></p>

Therefore, in addition to the external decoration of skeuomorphism, the skeuomorphic design of the player’s operation method is its deeper penetration.</p>
<p>In <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, the interface is combined with the electronic screen in the game, connecting information with the scene and placing the interface in the game, making the overall scene produce a more three-dimensional sense of space, and the integration with the scene is also more harmonious and unified. Players seem to be clicking on a control screen, and they are also brought into this virtual world. </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Dead Space</em> very cleverly integrates the UI with characters and scenes, realizing a deeper exploration of skeuomorphism. The UI interface is completely integrated with the game characters. The character’s health bar in the game can be viewed from the glowing body on the character’s back; while the real-time information of the game is displayed through the character’s hologram in the game. Through the internal UI interface of the scene, the overall game is presented more unified, complete, and real; it also makes the UI, characters, and scenes have a strong connection. Players will not feel detached during the game, and can fully devote themselves to the horror atmosphere. </p>

<h3 id="Use-Skeuomorphism-to-Build-Page-Hierarchy"><a href="#Use-Skeuomorphism-to-Build-Page-Hierarchy" class="headerlink" title="Use Skeuomorphism to Build Page Hierarchy"></a>Use Skeuomorphism to Build Page Hierarchy</h3><p>In skeuomorphic design, if it is not handled properly, it will cause confusion in the page hierarchy or inability to expand interface information. Therefore, in the design, attention should also be paid to using skeuomorphism to build the hierarchical relationship of the page. For example, in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, cards and notebooks are used to unfold the plot, and the page hierarchy is constructed through the plane relationship, front and back occlusion relationship, color light and shadow of the objects in this skeuomorphic interface, and with the help of book page turning. </p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The skeuomorphic style in the game world has left a deep impression on us. By simulating things and operation methods familiar to players, it can often allow players to quickly accept the game settings and substitute into the entire atmosphere. Skeuomorphic design not only conforms to various whimsical ideas in the game, but also enhances the player’s immersive experience, so it is widely used in many games. If you lack inspiration in design, you may consider referring to various clues in the real world, carrying out skeuomorphic design, and creating a more realistic and friendly interface!</p>

    <title>The Appearance and Disappearance of Information - Game Tooltip Design</title>
    <url>/2023/07/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20230726_28584_1101043/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230726/28584_1101043.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A tooltip is a common graphical user interface element. When a player hovers the mouse over an interface element that needs annotation, a tooltip will appear on the screen to provide supplementary game information.</p>
<p>Its existence not only helps players understand and identify information content, but also helps players process this information more efficiently, or guides players to perform a series of operations—without tooltips providing non-critical or additional information to users, information omission or overload is likely to occur.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Role-of-Tooltips-in-Game-Interaction"><a href="#1-The-Role-of-Tooltips-in-Game-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="1. The Role of Tooltips in Game Interaction"></a>1. The Role of Tooltips in Game Interaction</h2><p>On PC, players use the mouse to interact with various elements in the game on the screen, including the three basic states when interacting with the mouse: normal state, hover state (mouse hover), and active state (mouse click). The tooltip is a very common interaction element in the hover state, used to supplement the relevant information of the element.</p>
<p>Tooltips are an important form and component of game information prompts, and play a role in improving the efficiency of players reading information, guiding and confirming player operations in game interaction. The following will take PC <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as the main case to introduce the role of tooltips in game interaction.</p>
<h3 id="Improve-the-Efficiency-of-Players-Reading-Information"><a href="#Improve-the-Efficiency-of-Players-Reading-Information" class="headerlink" title="Improve the Efficiency of Players Reading Information"></a>Improve the Efficiency of Players Reading Information</h3><p>In a game with a more complex mechanism, the information conveyed to users also increases relatively. Therefore, the interactive interface usually uses concise graphics and text as much as possible, so that users can receive an appropriate amount of key information in the game, and more detailed information is presented in the form of tooltips, so as to assist in displaying non-critical information and achieve on-demand and efficient access to information.</p>
<p>Take the interface of selecting existing Souljades in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example. In the Souljade backpack list, the obtained Souljades are arranged horizontally in the form of “icon + Souljade name”. For experienced players, they can directly use this concise information (background quality color, Souljade shape&#x2F;name) to decide whether to pick up, replace, or discard Souljades, and make the fastest strategic decisions; while novice players can understand what the function of the Souljade is through the tooltip, and the key prompts for related operations, they can also familiarize themselves with the game and extract information and make in-game decisions relatively efficiently. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F58ef1859-ba2d-43c3-8050-291be83af026.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>At the same time, because the tooltip is an interactive element of the hover state, it will appear or disappear with the movement of the mouse, rather than being presented in a normal state like key information. Therefore, even if novice players are already familiar with the Souljade mechanism of the game, they will not feel that the information is complex and redundant. In addition, the game also systematically introduces the detailed information of each Souljade in the Souljade interface of the Combat Encyclopedia, which echoes the concise interaction in the game to achieve the unity of game experience playability and information comprehensiveness.</p>
<h3 id="Guide-and-Confirm-Player-Operations"><a href="#Guide-and-Confirm-Player-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Guide and Confirm Player Operations"></a>Guide and Confirm Player Operations</h3><p>One of the functions of tooltips is to guide user operations, and the embodiment in the game is usually key prompts. The key prompt box highlights the key prompt information of shortcut operations to facilitate players to perform quick operations. The figure below shows the key prompt for indicating the number of Bloodrippers to teammates in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. This is the most typical and concise form of key prompt box, namely key icon and text description. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5a249441-e421-462a-aadc-b3acddc8ef31.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Tooltip Key Prompt</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the weapon backpack of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, it also includes the enlarged icon of the weapon and the content of the weapon name. This is more abundant than the tooltip on the left, which is convenient for users to make decisions based on the supplementary information provided in the tooltip; compared with various inconvenient-to-remember information of Souljades, the content of the weapon tooltip is concise, omitting more weapon introduction content. This is because players have common sense understanding of weapons in real life. Whether it is a concise or rich form, this is related to the functionality of the interactive interface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fbb7f5106-12ff-4bf2-8a7d-1f1aea60e668.png/size/"></p>
<p>It is worth noting that this type of prompt is usually closely related to the element that is currently in the hover state. The equip&#x2F;discard shortcut keys in the figure are applicable to all items in the backpack, but in terms of use, they are related to the area where the mouse is hovering. The tooltip here also enlarges the key content and presents it to the player, so that the player can confirm the weapon to be equipped&#x2F;discarded according to the tooltip, so as to reduce misoperation in game decision-making. Therefore, the tooltip not only provides prompt information for player operations, but also plays a role in information confirmation when players perform related operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Tooltip-Design-Principles"><a href="#2-Tooltip-Design-Principles" class="headerlink" title="2. Tooltip Design Principles"></a>2. Tooltip Design Principles</h2><p>The simplest tooltip is often a combination of “function description + shortcut key”, which is characterized by short appearance time, association with marked elements, and short text; in fact, in games, the design of tooltips is very diverse, with different complex forms of graphic and text mixing.</p>
<p>These different forms of tooltips are born to assist the ever-changing game information presentation. But no matter how the form of the prompt changes, their purpose is to: help users understand, identify and process this information. Google has listed the principles of using tooltips in its developed Material Design, as a guide for using its web design tools. Some of the design principles contained therein also have high reference significance for game interaction design. Therefore, we will combine game cases to analyze the design specifications that need to be paid attention to in the design of tooltips, and their corresponding roles in experience design.</p>
<h3 id="Overall-Layout-Design"><a href="#Overall-Layout-Design" class="headerlink" title="Overall Layout Design"></a>Overall Layout Design</h3><p>In the overall interface that triggers the tooltip state, the tooltip is generally located at the top level of the overall interface, and can cover any interface element in the short appearance time. In order for players to see the information provided by the tooltip, a reasonable position layout is first required.</p>
<p>● <strong>Cannot be Truncated</strong></p>
<p>The most basic principle of tooltip layout is that it cannot be truncated. A truncated tooltip will greatly affect the user’s game experience, and may cause key information to be incompletely displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F2023%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fad13f836-3227-4da6-907f-1defd5d4bb89.png0726%2Fad13f836-3227-4da6-907f-1defd5d4bb89.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fad202cf3-e6fe-4750-a7fd-f5a45a483a5c.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Item Purchase Tooltip (Note: The picture below is a wrong illustration, not a game screenshot)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Relevance of Position and Control</strong></p>
<p>Because people’s visual habit of reading is from left to right, for tooltips that need to appear on the left and right sides of the corresponding element, they are usually placed on the right side. However, when the space on the right side is not enough to put down the tooltip, or the information in the space on the right side is more important than the left side and cannot be blocked, the tooltip will also be placed on the left side. Because of this, the tooltip areas we can see are often laid out in the middle of the game screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F0bd3c453-d10d-4f9f-8132-1c3d492116b1.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Item Tooltip Schematic (Note: Only one tooltip is triggered each time, this picture is a spliced picture)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, some game tooltips appear at the mouse, or at the center point of the selected control. At this time, the association between the tooltip and the selected information is stronger. For example, in the weapon interface of <em>Destiny 2</em>, the tooltip changes in real time with the position of the cursor. While the player’s line of sight moves with the cursor, the tooltip also moves with it. This is also a design in which the tooltip is strongly associated with the position of the cursor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F0f909d48-163a-4607-86c2-05a96db13196.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Destiny 2》 Weapon Interface Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the item tooltip appears on both sides of the control in order not to block the icon and other information of the in-game items. Therefore, the position of the tooltip needs to be near the control in the selected state, and the specific position layout needs to be not truncated and not conflict with the game information.</p>
<p>● <strong>Horizontal&#x2F;Vertical Layout is Related to the Interface</strong></p>
<p>The rationality of the layout is also related to the interaction elements. Because it is necessary to associate the tooltip with the hover element, the tooltips in the game screen will be close to the element in the absence of special circumstances, and the content will be highlighted through a more obvious background color.</p>
<p>The specific layout in which orientation of the corresponding element is usually related to other information in the game. For example, the option introduction tooltip in the figure below, as additional information of the vertically arranged list, is drawn out in the horizontal direction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F383f79e8-8fe7-4de4-8cec-4fd82d351967.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Marvel’s Spider-Man》 Setting Details Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similarly, when presenting horizontal information, the prompt content is laid out on the upper and lower sides; and in order to show the matching object of the tooltip information, sometimes there are designs with arrows or connecting lines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Ffe933f09-f5c9-45d0-ad9d-0570d0d5f532.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Yacht Dice》 Guide Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Consistent with the Interface Style</strong></p>
<p>In the design of the interactive interface, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> is mainly based on the dark blue technology style interface to simulate the AR picture seen by the Spider-Man character. In the design of the tooltip, it is also unified with the overall style of the game, and some broken line visual decorations are added to the tooltip to enrich the form, but at the same time, it will not let players be distracted by the decoration and ignore the content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5a09bdaf-ac8c-4921-8336-0aa31e69e0b8.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Tooltip-Content-Layout-Design"><a href="#Tooltip-Content-Layout-Design" class="headerlink" title="Tooltip Content Layout Design"></a>Tooltip Content Layout Design</h3><p>● <strong>Text Content is Concise</strong></p>
<p>When the tooltip is pure text content, the text should be as concise as possible to summarize the content that needs to be supplemented, and not to add unnecessary mental activity to the player. For example, in the map of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, you can see many icons that can be hovered and interacted with, and the function of this landmark is described in a very simple way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F4720d505-1e07-44bb-87a9-10bb3adb7006.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 In-game Map Vendor Tooltip (The left picture is the simplified Chinese version, and the right picture is the German version)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, for the consideration of localization adaptation, concise text can also make the tooltip content of each language within an appropriate length. As shown in the figure above, the tooltip is to keep the width of the tooltips of different languages the same, and the height can be adaptively wrapped and changed with the length of the text, which can not only correctly present each language, but also automatically change when the planner configures different texts.</p>
<p>● <strong>Text Hierarchy Presentation Form</strong></p>
<p>In the visual text expression, the text in the tooltip is the same as other text parts, and the hierarchy of text information can be reflected by size, thickness, and color. Allow players to read more text in detail and extract the information they need quickly and use it in the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5ce0addc-0ffc-4eef-824e-d6d017ba2471.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Event Rules Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the writing of the text, you can use more short sentences and make good use of paragraphs to create a better reading experience for players. In addition, it should be noted that the level of the tooltip basically appears at the top level and cannot be covered by other interface elements.</p>
<p>● <strong>Graphic and Text Mixing Method: Icon + Text</strong></p>
<p>Pictures are more intuitive and faster than words in expressing information. Choosing icons that can express the meaning of words can explain the text more vividly and clearly, and make the page not too boring.</p>
<p>And the image does not need to be localized to be understood by players, so the form of “icon + text” is very suitable for cross-platform global games, which can understand the tooltip content while reading, and associate the text with the image in the brain. In this way, players can quickly associate them together when they see the same icon in different game interfaces, thereby enhancing the game experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F1ef775ed-ba7d-43c8-ba5b-e64d200e188c.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fc3d6891e-e9a2-47f3-82dd-a06e9a268c1d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Hero Interface Skill Tooltip and In-game Skill Icon</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Design-of-Appearance-and-Disappearance"><a href="#Design-of-Appearance-and-Disappearance" class="headerlink" title="Design of Appearance and Disappearance"></a>Design of Appearance and Disappearance</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, in PC games, hovering and moving the mouse corresponds to the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip; in mobile games, since there is no hover interaction method, the method of clicking&#x2F;long pressing to call up the tooltip is adopted; in console games, the interaction of the handle corresponds to the mouse hover state by moving the cursor to select.</p>
<p>● <strong>Time Setting for the Appearance and Disappearance of Tooltips</strong></p>
<p>The trigger condition for the appearance of the tooltip is generally set to 0.3-0.5 seconds of mouse hover. This is to ensure that the user’s intention is to view the menu or the content behind the tooltip, rather than moving the mouse to other content or accidentally touching it. Occasionally, it will be triggered after the mouse&#x2F;cursor is moved to the corresponding control for a long time, as an entrance to the normally closed information prompt.</p>
<p>The trigger for the disappearance of the tooltip is uniformly after moving the mouse&#x2F;cursor, the control disappears after exceeding 0.5 seconds when it is not selected. Because only when the user clicks or stays outside the target area, or the mouse cursor leaves the target area and exposes the content for more than 0.5 seconds, can it be determined that the player intends to close the tooltip.</p>
<p>● <strong>Cannot Trigger Multiple Tooltips at the Same Time</strong></p>
<p>No matter what kind of game device, the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip are temporary, and have a strong match with the single element that the user is interacting with, and there is a basic principle: only a single tooltip can be triggered at the same time. Therefore, in the game, even if the UI elements overlap, the click hot zone of the tooltip still needs to be strictly divided, otherwise multiple tooltips will appear at the same time.</p>
<p>Only by ensuring that at most one tooltip is triggered, the fragmented information will not appear at the same time, so that players have a stronger willingness to read and a higher degree of understanding of the current information, and this focused presentation is also more helpful for players’ information understanding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fc15e09ec-a290-46a9-bc67-0aac73add9bf.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Gwent: The Witcher Card Game》 Tooltip: Only One Tooltip Can Be Triggered at a Time</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Simplified Animation Effects</strong></p>
<p>No matter what style, what display, the tooltip content must be clear and recognizable, and you cannot blindly pursue effects, and you cannot put the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>In the case that the interactive interface itself is relatively complex, the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip only needs a simple gradient transition, and even no animation effect design is needed. The main function of the tooltip is information presentation, and too gorgeous animation effects will increase the visual burden of players and hinder the reading of tooltip information.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>No matter what form the tooltip appears in, the main function is to present and hide appropriate information to the player in a timely manner. As an important part of the information prompt system, tooltips play a great role in players seeing, understanding, and using game information. Only by designing the most suitable information prompt system for the game can we create the smoothest and most natural experience for players. Therefore, for game designers, from whether to use tooltips, to the selection of tooltip content, form design, etc. are all issues that need to be carefully considered.</p>

    <title>When Games Meet Dopamine Dressing, How to Create Double Happiness</title>
    <url>/2023/07/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20230726_28584_1101047/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230726/28584_1101047.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are a frequent internet user or pay attention to fashion, you should have heard the buzzword “dopamine dressing” recently. In the WeChat index statistics, on a certain day in June alone, the entry for dopamine dressing exceeded 100 million times, with a day-on-day increase of more than 20%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F15e3af35-e3ac-472c-a2ea-4e26edd8f02d.png/size/"></p>
<p>For this seemingly mystifying new term, there are various definitions and descriptions on social media. Generally speaking, fashionable outfits that can effectively improve the wearer’s mood is the so-called “dopamine dressing”, which comes from fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released by the brain when a person receives pleasure. Most of the dopamine dressing currently popular online also conveys an optimistic and positive concept to people through simple color psychology. Psychologist Karen Pine said in her book “Mind What You Wear: The Psychology of Fashion” that “what we wear greatly affects how we feel, and even changes our thoughts and judgments.” Some scholars call it “enclothed cognition” and found that our outfits can have symbolic meanings that affect psychology and performance. Therefore, whether you want a colorful, sexy or just comfortable look, the most important thing is to wear clothes that make us feel happy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fb2ce3f37-329f-4842-9e77-f84bdb2ab17f.png/size/"></p>
<p>The popularity of dopamine dressing also shows that many people, especially young people, are eager to find their own happiness.</p>
<p>So, in games that also produce a lot of dopamine, what kind of wonderful chemical reaction will the two have?</p>
<p>In fact, in many games, there is such a large group of players with online aesthetics who pay more attention to or like to appreciate the appearance of skins in the game, generally called “appearance-oriented players”; among them, there are also many powerful players who have the hobby of collecting game skins. There are many reasons why they love game skins. On the one hand, the game art caters to their preferences; on the other hand, trying different styles, colors and even skins of different genders in the virtual world can give people a refreshing experience. What attracts them may be to show off their cool fashion special effects, maybe the exaggerated and alternative styles they dare not try in reality, or even the gender-breaking dressing experience.</p>
<p>With the recent popularity of the concept of “dopamine dressing” on social media, people have found that changing clothes and color matching can bring a sense of pleasure, and many players have also shown off their in-game dopamine dressing on social media. Combining the psychological principles of dopamine dressing, we analyze some core points of game dopamine dressing.</p>
<h2 id="1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games"><a href="#1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Dopamine Dressing in Games"></a>1. Dopamine Dressing in Games</h2><h3 id="Color-Matching-is-a-Science"><a href="#Color-Matching-is-a-Science" class="headerlink" title="Color Matching is a Science"></a>Color Matching is a Science</h3><p>The first principle of dopamine dressing is to trigger positive emotions in oneself and those around them by emphasizing the visual impact brought by colors. The core is to make colors bring people a sense of happiness, comfort and confidence.</p>
<p>In terms of color matching, it is more common to stack skins with similar tones to produce a uniform effect. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players can find multiple pleasures and a sense of belonging through fashion and social interaction by dressing in the same color series as other friends. In these dopamine outfits shared by players, black is mysterious, green is natural and fresh, red is joyful and festive, and blue is cold and quiet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F9ff10237-4a5b-4f92-ac11-4bca034513b1.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The above Naraka dopamine dressing materials are taken from the sharing of users on the Xiaohongshu platform (MISAKA&#x2F;F Class Yuan Xiangqin, etc.)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, although contrasting color combinations are risky, they sometimes have surprising visual effects. For example, in the dopamine dressing shared by <em>Justice Online</em> players, the dark-toned male character fashion and the bright-toned female character walking together also create a wonderful sense of contrast. </p>

<h3 id="Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF"><a href="#Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF" class="headerlink" title="Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF"></a>Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF</h3><p>From the examples in the figure above, it is not difficult to notice that in order to achieve a better visual unity effect, not only can the character’s fashion be matched with the same color series as much as possible, but the scene and accessories are also quite particular. For example, in the black fashion, the player chose the background of the dark night roof. The green outfit is matched with mountain waterfalls and green leaf embellishments. In the red outfit, the character holds Spring Festival couplets to add atmosphere. The blue outfit is on the ice and is accompanied by a “cold” expression. In order to enhance the emotional stimulation effect, many users will add a circle of emoticons of corresponding colors or emotions around the characters to make the picture more vivid and lively, and have an atmosphere. This is especially important when players take screenshots or photos to share.</p>
<h3 id="Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password"><a href="#Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password"></a>Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password</h3><p>This type of video shared by players on social media adopts the common stepping-on-the-beat dressing form of short videos, emphasizing the dynamic effect of the picture, and the picture feeling and emotional stimulation are very direct. With excellent fashion, it is easier to amaze the viewers. Rhythm control is also one of the important elements that determine whether the dopamine dressing video is attractive. Some will match the background music with a strong sense of rhythm to match the picture, and some will use the seven days of the week as the switching node. “One change a day” gives people a stronger sense of substitution. </p>

For example, the Terracotta Army, in fact, their original colors when they were just unearthed were very rich. There were 8 colors in total, including red, green, black, white, blue, purple, yellow, and pink, with nearly 20 shades on different parts of the clothing. These colored pigments came from various minerals or plants in nature, and the color matching was also very bold and avant-garde. There are also a few synthetic materials in the pigments, such as “Chinese purple”, “lead white” and “lead red”, which are considered to be artificially made.</p>
<p>It is understood that scientists first discovered barium copper silicate on Han Dynasty pottery in 1992 and called it “Han purple”. Later, it was found that it was widely used on the Qin Terracotta Army, so it is now generally called “Chinese purple”. The thousands of faces of the Terracotta Army are also vivid and lively due to the “dopamine” color dressing under the careful dressing of ancient craftsmen. Chinese purple is also used by some game art designers to extract design inspiration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fb69055f1-a5ad-466e-b634-16e3d47a72f1.png/size/"></p>
<p>The “dopamine dressing” style of the Han Dynasty was based on classical elegance. Hanfu and Han etiquette showed the elegance in the hearts of Chinese people. The main colors of clothing were white, khaki, and brown, embellished with red and pink.</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty had a broad vision, broad mind and open attitude in terms of political and economic systems, culture and art, and social atmosphere. It absorbed foreign cultures, innovated and developed, and led China into a new era. The Tang Sancai human figurines preserved in many museums in Shaanxi also show the popular “dopamine” dressing at that time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F35ea4bc8-264b-4a63-b086-0f68cb372119.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>“Clothes are wrapped in clouds and mist, and fairy music saves all beings.” In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the image of Longmen Feitian is perfectly restored on the character. The golden璎珞, 帔帛, the drooping clothes, and the color matching of pink, green and red have high recognition and excellent visual presentation effects, which can fully mobilize the positive emotions of players, and at the same time show the traditional Chinese culture, tracing back thousands of years, and presenting history to the world in a new look. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F3354cac8-c14b-40ef-a87c-ffde0fdb6149.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is dopamine dressing in reality or fashion matching in games, it is a new way for people to express healthy, positive and optimistic concepts. “Dopamine dressing” may be just one of the many concepts that have quickly become popular with the help of social media, but its diversified expression in various carriers, such as the combination with video games, also gives more people the courage to show their personality and preferences.</p>

    <title>The Rise of UGC - How Can Grassroots Creators Become Big Trees</title>
    <url>/2023/08/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20230807_28584_1103302/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230807/28584_1103302.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the global sweep of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> to <em>Fortnite’s</em> UEFN editor becoming a recent hit, the importance of UGC in the gaming field is increasing day by day. Many domestic and foreign game manufacturers have entered the game, either implementing editors in the game or providing level design activities, providing players with a series of level editing tools, allowing players to give full play to their creativity. This form of players being both content consumers and creators may become a major trend in the future development of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fd5e697fc-6397-4ac5-a8b9-ac617b27bdcb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>PUBG Mobile launched the creator mode “World of Wonder”, where players can freely build maps&#x2F;modes</em></p>
<p>At the same time, according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, players spend nearly half of their game time playing in the worlds created in Fortnite Creative, and some creators even earn a lot of income by helping commercial companies build custom worlds in <em>Fortnite</em>. Players’ desire and enthusiasm for UGC content can also be seen.</p>
<p>Among the endless player works, the creative masters among the players have attracted a lot of attention. Many well-known game media or game officials have interviewed them to explore the creative process and design inspiration of these players. There is no doubt that the stories of top creators can inspire developers and motivate onlookers, but they are still not enough for us to understand the entire UGC player ecosystem.</p>
<p>From the KOL pyramid model, ordinary UGC players (mid-tail + long-tail) are a large number of creators. What are the similarities and differences between them and top creators? What is their current situation? What are their demands? There is very little research and discussion at present. We contacted some players of popular UGC games on the market, hoping to provide some clues on how to tap and maintain this group of players with a large base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F54901c5d-686f-4bc4-a61a-52e9efda6e3c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?"></a>1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?</h2><p>Strawberry is a college student player who entered Roblox last year, but only started to try the editor this year. “Every time I log in, I will see the popular maps on the homepage. When I play those, I want to replicate a similar map.” Coincidentally, Green Wine, a veteran player of <em>Minecraft</em>, also has similar ideas. “I always see visual feast maps on Bilibili. The color matching is very good. I think it’s amazing. I also want to try to make a map of my own.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fb7d106aa-7438-4b56-9b0f-d8366786dfdb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Visual Feast</em></p>
<p>Or attracted by the popularity, similar to shooting Douyin&#x2F;posting on Weibo, they will follow the trend to post popular theme content or bring popular topic tags. Many ordinary UGC players “want to be able to make very popular works themselves, and want more people to like them. This may be the same as the current popular hotspots. No one will like a static model. Everyone wants to try popular things.” Trying to make similar UGC content to ride the trend has become the starting point of their creative path.</p>
<p>In addition, wanting to make maps for friends&#x2F;partners to check in and play together is also one of the opportunities for some players to start creating. Landscape check-in works are more common. Many players want to use the game editor as a carrier to create a place for themselves and their friends to leave memories&#x2F;commemorations. “The opportunity to start making maps is to make a commemorative map that can be played with friends, because when I play some maps with novel and beautiful scenery, it is worth checking in, so I want to create a commemorative map in my mind.” Similar to sandbox game players and MMO home players, these UGC creators hope to build homes or internet celebrity scenic spots, pursuing love &amp; peace. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F98679b75-3f73-401c-bbb8-be1b955c472b.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Dutch Windmill Village in Minecraft</em></p>
<p>Some creators also hope to make maps with stronger interaction, or create game levels that can be played together with friends, or make prank maps to see friends’ funny and frustrated reactions. “The opportunity is that I often go to play other people’s maps, so I want to make a map for my partners to play. At first, I wanted to make something for viewing, but if it is only for viewing and has no playability, I will add some gameplay.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F5fe1afcf-44f2-4bc3-a84a-0a848b3c8475.png/size/"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that there are a group of players who have the idea of ​​trying it themselves after seeing beautiful and amazing, or unique and fresh high-heat UGC content on social media. And their creative inspiration, or the idea of ​​starting to create, more or less revolves around one word - replication (imitation), either imitating the works of others, or moving reality into the game.</p>
<p>This is easy to understand. Compared with creating from scratch, replication has a clearer and more visible creative object, and the sense of goal will be relatively stronger, so that it will not be abandoned at the beginning; secondly, the “creation” threshold of replication is low, and the probability of success is high. You can feel the fun of creation and the sense of accomplishment in a short time. Many players can also make micro-innovations on the basis of replication, draw inferences from one another, and the investment cost is relatively low.</p>
<p>In addition, many creative novices enjoy the creative process, similar to the handmade circle. Seeing beautiful and interesting handicrafts (wool felt, cream glue, tufting, etc.), they will also want to follow the tutorial to make it themselves, and feel the fun of handmade DIY. “I started making maps because I thought YEET A PET was very interesting, so I wanted to try to make it myself, and then I slowly figured out some rules of the editor,” said Lemon Tea, a Roblox player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F7996b687-7fea-40b4-95c9-2180f4768008.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Popular Roblox Game, “YEET A PET”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been increasingly confirmed after asking them about their creative ideas and creative bottlenecks. The creative ideas of these players have obvious commonalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of gameplay type design, most of them are based on cross-border reference, such as landscape check-in, escape room, haunted house, LARP, and so on. The specific level design is also not innovative from scratch, but draws inspiration from reality (variety shows, film and television dramas, novels, lyrics, etc.) or other games</li>
<li>The art style is also mostly following the trend, with real life (buildings&#x2F;natural scenery and other landscapes, IP images in other fields, etc.) and official season styles being sources of inspiration</li>
<li>Or follow the current hot spots, and wait for top creators to research and develop new gameplay&#x2F;new art styles, and then follow the trend to gradually form a trend</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that their ideas are not creative enough, but that they think it is difficult to materialize the ideas out of thin air. “I have a lot of ideas, but I just can’t make them.” This is mostly limited by the breadth and depth of their use of tools.</p>
<p>For ordinary creators, the introduction and use of UGC tools often “borrow” ideas from top creators. Regarding tool usage skills (how to use advanced tools, how to combine tools, what kind of finished products can be made with XX tools, what functions can improve the efficiency of mapping, etc.), they usually need to provide a problem-solving idea, or have examples to explain the principle of tool use, absorb + use it from practice, so as to draw inferences from one another, and adapt&#x2F;create new content themselves.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?"></a>2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?</h2><p>Similar to top creators, the motivation for ordinary UGC players to continue creating is mostly the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Fun] Creating results with their own hands, experiencing the fun and sense of accomplishment of creation</li>
<li>[Recognition] Continuously gaining likes and recognition from the public, and resonating with everyone through their works</li>
<li>[Opportunity] Gaining recognition and support from the official, thereby further expanding their influence</li>
<li>[Reward] Discovering actual material rewards &amp; income opportunities (such as providing customized services, becoming a social media KOL)</li>
<li>[Community belonging] Making new friends during the creative process, often conducting friendly exchanges and discussions, and generating a sense of community belongin.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the process of constantly contacting creators, we also found that, in addition to generating electricity for love, ordinary UGC players are more motivated by the support and encouragement of the audience and fans, as well as the monetization opportunities they seek, to overcome difficulties and improve their creations.</p>
<p>Although the long-lasting incentives of the platform and the occasional stories of popular authors have “tempted” many players to enter the circle, in fact, players have also noticed that “it’s not our turn”, “winning the competition is only because of traffic, there must be gold buried. Like the famous gods now, the popular maps are always made by the same people, and the usual map push traffic is also very poor, no one comes to play, there is really no motivation.” The feeling of pouring out all their enthusiasm makes ordinary creators with a small fan base feel more and more difficult to get ahead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F8c7972db-7800-4272-8e1e-1c7bc14c4b9f.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F825c0085-9256-430d-9fbb-01c80f86c131.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic"><a href="#Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic" class="headerlink" title="Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic"></a><em>Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic</em></h2><p>On the one hand, aside from players who only care about the fun of creation, ordinary creators often face the dilemma of entering the game late and finding it difficult to get ahead. Unlike the top creators at the top of the pyramid, they have relied on continuous themes and content innovation, coupled with personal characteristics, and finally have an unshakable position in the subdivided field. However, ordinary creators are limited by the shrinking blue ocean theme field, and they also lack the ability to use tools, and they don’t know where to start to create content with their own characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, game UGC, as a content creation track, most of the UGC content recommendation systems in the game are not much different from the operation ideas of external vertical communities. The platform and top creators have a “symbiotic relationship”, and the platform’s traffic will unconsciously tilt towards the top. First, in terms of commercial realization, top creators are an important bargaining chip for the platform, and the platform will also give top creators more monetization opportunities. Secondly, in terms of user ecology, top creators can help the platform attract new users and stimulate user activity with strong and distinctive content creation, and the platform can be more inclined to top creators in terms of recommendation algorithms. Therefore, in the content ecosystem created by the platform, the status of creators in different circles of the pyramid is very different. The higher you go, the harder it is to break the barriers between circles.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>UGC has become a new trend in the development of the game industry. However, in addition to relying on the guidance and drive of top creators, ordinary players are also an indispensable part of this ecology. Therefore, how to bring high-quality, high-potential maps to consumer players, how to make ordinary creators stand out, continuously supplement and support creators, and avoid the phenomenon of monopoly or lack of successors, is a long-term operation problem that UGC game manufacturers urgently need to consider.</p>

    <title>Immersive, Role-Playing, or Spectating - How Character Involvement Affects Your Purchase of Game Cosmetics</title>
    <url>/2023/07/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20230807_28584_1103304/</url>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In RPG games, you usually play a certain character in the game, and this character brings you into a brand new virtual world.</p>
<p>By taking on this role, you can explore this virtual world, interact with other NPCs, experience various ups and downs, twists and turns of stories and adventures; constantly think about various puzzles in the game, find the best solution, promote the development of the game plot, and obtain various upgrades of the character.</p>
<h2 id="1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating</h2><p>The game protagonist played by the player usually has two typical images, one is immersive, and the other is a blank slate.</p>
<h3 id="Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion"><a href="#Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)"></a>Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)</h3><p>Most of the earliest RPG games had immersive protagonists.</p>
<p>This kind of protagonist has unique character settings and thinking modes, and the game plot will also deeply portray their background stories, character relationships, and personality traits. The protagonist will express their likes and dislikes, opinions, and actively take many actions in various event dialogues. Players cannot change the appearance and name of the protagonist, such as Li Xiaoyao in “Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy” and Link in “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”. When playing this type of game, the player’s experience is closer to interactive movies and TV.</p>
<p>Another type of immersive protagonist is the character that can be switched into during the game process, such as in “Revelation M”. Players can switch into other characters to explore the map and battle, and these characters also have unique personalities and backgrounds. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa83fb212-a71d-4477-a193-cfb0067dfd48.png/size/" alt="《Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy》 RPG series game first generation"></p>
<h3 id="Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)"></a>Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)</h3><p>The biggest feature of this type of character is the lack of personality. The background story line is complete but rarely portrayed; they rarely express opinions in plot dialogues, and even if there are opinions, there are branch options. Many characters do not have voice acting, such as Lumine in “Genshin Impact”. Everyone knows that she is a traveler from a foreign land, but it is difficult to say what kind of person she is.</p>
<p>An American cartoonist, Scott McCloud’s, point is that “the fewer details a character has, the more likely readers are to project themselves into that character.” Many games now allow players to customize the appearance attributes of the protagonist, such as face customization, hair dyeing, and even body customization, but they still cannot provide customized personal plots for all types of “player avatars”. Therefore, blank slate protagonists usually cannot have obvious personality traits.</p>
<p>The original intention of the blank slate protagonist is to allow players to immerse themselves in the game world. But in actual contact with players, we found that among the blank slate protagonists, a large number of players do not immerse themselves in the role, whether it is an MMORPG that emphasizes the experience of the virtual world or an otome game that emphasizes immersion.</p>
<p>For example, in MMORPGs, many male players choose to play female characters, not because they want to experience the plot or battle from the perspective of a female character, but simply because they think the female character is better-looking. In otome games, many female players do not substitute themselves for the protagonist and date the virtual characters, but use the protagonist’s eyes as a camera, go through the plot, and watch the relationships, just like reading a novel or watching a drama. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F44b30c9a-1722-4d02-ad36-0f661cee3d45.png/size/" alt="Selection interface in Justice Online mobile game."></p>
<p>These types of players can be called spectator-perspective players.</p>
<p>The spectator perspective has no personality characteristics and no character restrictions. The protagonist can be imagined as anyone. For example, adult players will choose to play loli characters and raise them as daughters, while male players playing female characters may project the expected female personality and appearance.</p>
<p>Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating, to put it simply, immersion is to experience the love, hate, and stories of someone else; Role-Playing is to put yourself in the role of the protagonist and personally experience the joys and sorrows of this world; Spectating is to use the perspective of the protagonist as a camera to observe the stories that happen in this world, and the protagonist has little to do with the story itself.</p>
<h2 id="2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions"><a href="#2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions" class="headerlink" title="2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions"></a>2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions</h2><p>Different game protagonists’ self-involvement methods not only affect the player’s plot experience, but more interestingly, we found that these three involvement methods will have completely different effects on the player’s fashion purchase decisions.</p>
<h3 id="Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes"><a href="#Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes" class="headerlink" title="Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes"></a>Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes</h3><p>Take the two dress-up games “Shining Nikki” and “Life Makeover” as examples:</p>
<p>“Shining Nikki” adopts a typical immersive protagonist. There is a very vivid description of Nikki on the Internet. “Su Nikki, an ordinary person who can’t help staying up late and likes to hum even though she sings out of tune, is enthusiastic to everyone and comes to a strange world. Watching the world collapse in front of her, she constantly tries to save the world several times. Facing the separation from her parents and the betrayal of her friends, she can still be kind and full of vitality.”</p>
<p>“Life Makeover” uses a blank slate protagonist. Players can personalize the name, face, and even height and body shape of the protagonist. As for the protagonist herself, her background story also revolves around her sister. Her sister is a private detective, and there is very little description of the protagonist herself.</p>
<p>The advantage of the blank slate protagonist is that it can meet more diverse needs of substitution or viewing, but it is also difficult to generate empathy due to the lack of character details and distinct personality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Angel and Devil set PV on the first anniversary of “Shining Nikki” became popular and resonated with many old Nikki players, who returned to the game; the main point of popularity was the plot. This set of clothes was given special meaning by the plot, so many people empathized and collected it. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F7f160228-3f16-40a9-ab49-91991d91cb33.png/size/" alt="Fan-made rendition of Shining Nikki’s Angel and Devil set that commemorates its first anniversary."></p>
<p>The first six-star limited-time set of “Life Makeover” - Snow Heavy Glory, although there is also a high-quality fashion PV, on social platforms, most people’s attention is only on whether the fashion is beautiful, and few people pay attention to the theme story behind the fashion. For many people, it is just a beautiful six-star appearance. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F0c511e02-d45e-48a4-ab56-b995184cf3bc.png/size/" alt="Life Makeover’s first limited-time set, Snow Heavy Glory."></p>
<p>In game fashion design, the theme is a very important part. Like “Shining Nikki”, the plot can give clothes a special meaning, making many people empathize and collect them, bringing added value to fashion.</p>
<p>In MMO games, the protagonist is usually a blank slate, and the theme value of game fashion is often completed through collaboration, which is the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>For example, the Little Prince and Rose set, which has high sales in “Revelation M”, is based on the classic plot of The Little Prince; when the double ponytail was just launched, many players also began to cosplay Sailor Moon. Recently, the Green Snake set, which is very popular in “Justice Online Mobile”, its interactive action is a restoration of a very classic scene in the movie Green Snake, making players exclaim: It’s so thematic. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fd22e9db0-07c5-4ea1-b89b-028aa2dc27e1.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%21%5BThe%20Green%20Snake%20Set%20in%20Justice%20Online%20Mobile.%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa079a928-332a-4568-82df-84b2a03b8712.png/size/" alt="The Little Prince and the Rose Set in Revelation Mobile."></p>
<p>In the above two cases, the added value of the theme to fashion is achieved through the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>In MMO games, if the theme is to give fashion special meaning, first of all, this theme must have a three-dimensional&#x2F;highly recognizable character, and be accompanied by an attractive plot, such as the Little Prince, Green Snake, Fa Hai, etc. Simply giving fashion a theme plot atmosphere without character setting, it is difficult for players to empathize and collect. In addition, it is also necessary to consider the role that players want to substitute, for example, in the theme of Journey to the West, female players will definitely want to substitute the Jade Rabbit, not Sun Wukong.</p>
<h3 id="Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating</h3><p>Players who substitute themselves generally choose the same gender role. When going through the plot or participating in game activities, in order to better substitute into the plot situation, they often dress themselves up and wear fashion that matches the plot to go through the plot. This is more obvious in the Japanese player research. More Japanese players are substituting themselves when playing MMO games. Fashion matching the theme of the expansion pack can attract these players, and they are also more likely to buy fashion because they want to participate in the plot or activities of the expansion pack. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fb48377de-0771-4f70-8226-f2c62a450911.jpg/size/" alt="The “Tide Light” faction fashion of “Justice Online”&#39;s large-scale expansion pack “Bihai Chaoguang”."></p>
<p>For spectator players, since the character has no obvious personality characteristics under the spectator perspective, players do not substitute themselves, and there are no restrictions on fixed character settings. They can easily imagine the protagonist as anyone, and switch between protagonists of different genders and ages without burden. At the same time, they also have no fixed character choice constraints, and there is no pressure to switch between different styles of characters. This part of the players will have more diverse choices.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the lack of substitution needs, fashion launched in conjunction with the plot and activities of the expansion pack may not necessarily empower fashion. For these players, choosing beautiful clothes to go through the plot is a higher priority than choosing suitable clothes to go through the plot. They project the personality and appearance of the male&#x2F;female they expect in their hearts onto the character. Therefore, in terms of fashion choices, they are more inclined to styles that meet their own group or other groups’ expectations and preferences. For example, in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in China, fairy and sexy are ranked at the top, while in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in Japan, gentleness is ranked at the top. This is also relatively close to the personality expectations of adult women in different social environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Immersion is experiencing the story, substitution is personal experience, and viewing is observing the story. The relationship between different involvement methods and fashion is: In blank slate character games, players who substitute and players who view need to be treated differently. Players who substitute are more suitable for designing theme role-playing fashion, and viewers pay more attention to the beauty and universal aesthetics of fashion. The same is the immersive way of involvement. The theme gives fashion highly recognizable characters and attractive plots. For example, collaborating with other themes outside the game can give fashion a deeper meaning and purchase attraction.</p>

    <title>Motivation + Ability + Prompt - How Does the Fogg Model Guide Player Behavior</title>
    <url>/2023/07/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20230807_28584_1103305/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230807/28584_1103305.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?"></a>1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?</h2><p>The Fogg Behavior Model was proposed by Dr. BJ Fogg, founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. The Fogg Behavior Model states that three elements must converge simultaneously for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of these three elements is missing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The degree of desire to perform a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Ability:</strong> The ease or difficulty of completing a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt:</strong> The incentives and feedback that trigger a certain behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be explained in a diagram. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F4c2d7e7d-8adb-46e4-b2bf-e8bd9e77b5a1.png/size/"></p>
<p>The essence of interaction design is the design of user behavior. The Fogg Model, as a classic user psychology model, can be said to be one of the underlying logics of interaction design and has important guiding significance for interaction design.</p>
<p>The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) makes it easier to understand behavior in general. It highlights three main elements, each with subcomponents. Specifically, the FBM outlines the core motivators (motivation), simplicity factors (ability), and types of prompts. The subcomponents define the larger elements; for example, in the FBM, the word <em>ability</em> refers to how simplicity factors work together in the context of prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Ff6956b2a-6f2d-4449-b15e-2c254b2c0471.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h3><p>Unlike psychologists who advocate for extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, Professor Fogg divides the sources of motivation into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensation (physical level):</strong> Essentially, sensation is driven by our pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. Some behaviors bring us pain (behaviors we want to avoid), some behaviors bring us pleasure (behaviors that motivate us to continue), and sometimes multiple motivations conflict with each other, leading to our mental anguish (such as wanting to lose weight but also wanting to eat high-calorie foods).</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation (emotional level):</strong> The benefits that can be obtained or the punishments that can be avoided by taking action (which can correspond to extrinsic motivation in psychology). For example, hope and fear are the most powerful motivators, making people yearn to be part of something very meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging (social level):</strong> This makes people feel that they are part of society, and this sense of belonging keeps them motivated. For example, all your friends are doing it (which corresponds to extrinsic motivation in psychology).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, motivation itself is constantly changing and very unstable. Therefore, in specific design, we can prioritize solving ability and prompt issues to improve the behavior conversion rate of motivated users. Secondly, we should seize the peak of user motivation to guide users to perform corresponding behaviors, rather than converting after the user’s motivation drops. When motivation is high, people can do difficult things, but once motivation declines, people will only complete easy things.</p>
<h3 id="Ability-Cost"><a href="#Ability-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Ability&#x2F;Cost"></a>Ability&#x2F;Cost</h3><p>The horizontal axis of the Fogg Model is ability, from “hard to do” to “easy to do.” Professor Fogg believes that people have a natural tendency to be lazy. Therefore, although people can be trained to perform target behaviors, it is usually more effective to make the behavior easy. In addition, he believes that what users care about most is cost. Instead of increasing his motivation to do something with more temptation, it is better to think about reducing the cost of doing it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F0c28bd6e-6c58-4fca-b9fc-d0bfd0fbd40b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In games, the player’s ability is reflected in the hero level, the player’s moves and abilities in the game, the amount of currency and items they have, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="Prompt"><a href="#Prompt" class="headerlink" title="Prompt"></a>Prompt</h3><p>The hardest thing in the world is “doing the right thing at the right time.” For promoting conversion, it is “persuading users to do what they can with the right motivation at the right time.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa5df5077-c0e5-4794-896f-12c9a6ae9578.png/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> When users do not have enough motivation, they need to be stimulated with explanatory text or videos to generate motivation, such as limited-time free items, discounts, and novice prizes for new users in the store.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitator:</strong> When users already have enough motivation, but sometimes they don’t know how to do it, they need help to complete the conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> When users have both the motivation to do it and know how to do it, what they need is a reminder at the right time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful conversion occurs when motivation is strong and implementation costs are low, which is above the threshold in the figure above. But sometimes, strong motivation and low cost cannot be fully satisfied. At this time, it is necessary to ensure that there is no design with high cost and insufficient user motivation.</p>

<li><strong>Increase player motivation - Reward distribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Providing a reward preview in the task interface allows players to know the specific rewards they can obtain by completing the task, thereby increasing players’ motivation to complete the task. Players often complete tasks they didn’t originally intend to do because they want specific rewards.</p>
<p>At the same time, since the motivation and ability required to stimulate player behavior are two complementary factors, when setting awards, it is also necessary to set the size of the reward according to the difficulty of the task. When a task is difficult, setting a reward of sufficiently high value can motivate players to take action. </p>

</ul>
<p>The most common external motivations in games are various medals, rewards, and leaderboards. These rewards are not only a reward for players’ activity in the game, but also an external motivation to encourage players to improve their abilities and continue to be active in the game, prompting players to obtain these badges out of the mentality of “I want what others have.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F6af6b63f-6d88-42f9-8316-0405dc7e13eb.png/size/"></p>

<p>Just like shopping in daily life, when we see something that many people buy, we always can’t help but take a second look, and our desire to consume is higher. In the design of the store page, highlighting hot-selling products is also a way to increase players’ sense of belonging and stimulate consumption. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F517f816f-4734-4b22-a817-a9682e6d2e66.png/size/"></p>

<p>Increase the scarcity of goods - things are more valuable when they are rare. People always focus on what they will lose, not what they will get. When we see a limited-time discount in our shopping cart, we usually feel a sense of urgency that we are about to lose the opportunity to pick up a bargain. This mentality is also used in some game stores, using a combination of discounts and limited-time sales to stimulate player consumption. </p>

</ul>
<p>“By focusing on Simplicity of the target behavior you increase Ability.” Simplifying the target behavior is the process of empowering users.</p>
<p>Breaking down tasks into steps and guiding players to complete them is a common way to guide players to complete tasks step by step. In novice tasks, it is also common to gradually break down the tasks to guide players to accumulate experience. By turning some high-cost behaviors, such as completing tasks with larger goals, into small steps, and supplemented by different completion incentives, users can unknowingly accumulate a lot of successful experience. </p>

<p>When players first enter a game, there is usually a novice guidance process to help players quickly understand the gameplay of the game and improve players’ abilities in the game. Whether the novice guidance can truly enable players to master the operation methods and gameplay of the game is also an important factor that determines whether players can stay in the game in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Small details to guide players to new information in the game - red dot prompts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Red dot prompts are a basic guiding method widely used in interaction design. For example, the various new message prompts in the apps we see most often in our lives use a small red dot to prompt users to open the message box to view messages, which also applies users’ obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology to a certain extent.</p>
<p>When a new costume is added to a hero, the red dot prompts at all levels of the path can ensure that players can accurately find the newly launched costume among the many pieces of information, thereby prompting players to try it on and purchase it. Including game updates, in-game event updates, and gameplay opening prompts, etc., can also be used in this simple way to guide players to participate in new activities in the game. </p>

<p>Limited-time open gameplay prompt - <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s “Realm of Gods” gameplay is open for a limited time, but players may not accurately remember the opening time of the gameplay. A small red dot can remind players that the gameplay is open and it’s time to start a game. Without the prompt of a small red dot, players may gradually forget that this gameplay will be opened at a specific time. In this function, such a design not only guides players’ behavior, but also reduces players’ cognitive load. They no longer need to remember the opening time of the gameplay themselves. </p>

</ul>
<p>In the “Realm of Gods” gameplay of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the UI difference of the recommended Divine Sense level above the level confirmation button visually informs players whether they have matched the behavioral ability required by the level. The gold color of recommended Divine Sense Level, indicates that the player has reached the recommended Divine Sense level, informing players that has the ability to perform this action, thus directly satisfying the “ability” factor that triggers the action. When the required behavioral ability is not reached, a red prompt is used to prevent players from misjudging their abilities and challenging the level, but instead gaining frustration from it. </p>

    <title>Invariance Amidst Change - Commonalities and Individualities in Game Top Navigation Design</title>
    <url>/2023/08/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20230816_28584_1104895/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230816/28584_1104895.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In games, the top navigation is the skeleton of the game, supporting the overall content and information, helping the game to display the entrances of various functions intuitively and clearly to the player. The design of the top navigation is invariant amidst change. Its form serves its navigational functionality and follows similar interaction principles. This article will start from the functionality of the game top navigation, use multiple cases to illustrate the design commonalities of the game top navigation, and talk about its adaptation design on different platforms.</p>
<h2 id="1-Form-Serves-Function-Commonalities-of-Top-Navigation"><a href="#1-Form-Serves-Function-Commonalities-of-Top-Navigation" class="headerlink" title="1. Form Serves Function - Commonalities of Top Navigation"></a>1. Form Serves Function - Commonalities of Top Navigation</h2><p>The form of design serves the function. The function of top navigation boils down to displaying entrances of different levels and playing a certain guiding role. A good top navigation design should be able to clearly express the information of each entrance, and provide appropriate and eye-catching guidance for the information that needs attention.</p>
<h3 id="Design-Basis-Design-According-to-Browsing-Order"><a href="#Design-Basis-Design-According-to-Browsing-Order" class="headerlink" title="Design Basis: Design According to Browsing Order"></a>Design Basis: Design According to Browsing Order</h3><p>Users have an “F-shaped” browsing mode when browsing web pages or apps. The characteristic of this mode is to focus the user’s attention on the top and left side of the page. Specifically, the first line of text on the same page receives more attention than the following lines; the first few words on the left of each line are more acceptable than the words on the right.</p>
<p>In design, the functions of the top navigation bar will also be arranged according to weight, and more important functions will be placed in the left area. Because in the structure of the “F-shaped mode”, the content on the far left in the top navigation has more visual weight, it is located in a more main visual area and has a higher priority. For example, in the mail system of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> below, the main title is placed on the far left, and the other entrances are arranged according to the frequency of use and general browsing habits. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Hierarchy-Clearly-Defined-Information-Presentation"><a href="#Design-Hierarchy-Clearly-Defined-Information-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Design Hierarchy: Clearly Defined Information Presentation"></a>Design Hierarchy: Clearly Defined Information Presentation</h3><p>The top navigation belongs to the global control layer of the interface, and undertakes the control and navigation functions of the entire product, determining the interaction logic and sequence of the product. The top navigation supports the overall structure as the skeleton of the product, which can effectively reduce the understanding cost of the interface.</p>
<p>Therefore, the level of the top navigation itself also needs to be more distinct, and it needs to be able to simplify the information of the main interface and help players quickly reach the target interface. If the top navigation occupies an important position and presents too much information, it will increase the burden of use. In the design process, it is necessary to sort out the functions by level, and incorporate the important entrances and information of high frequency into the top navigation.</p>
<p>Taking the design of the lobby entrance of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example, important content related to the in-game experience (heroes, talents, weapons), and the main promotion information related to the season are placed on the left side of the top navigation, and the less important information and functions are placed on the right side, achieving a relatively distinct level display. </p>

<p>  Text is often used to describe the function of the entrance. If the interface information density is too high, icons can also be used to reduce the cognitive load caused by text. In addition, when there is secondary navigation, it is necessary to design in terms of level layout, color, text, etc., to distinguish the primary and secondary relationship of different levels of navigation.</p>

<pre><code>- **Hover state:** Supplementary explanation, click prompt

    In some interfaces with too much information, you can consider using the Hover state to trigger explanatory Tips to explain the detailed role of the entrance, so that players who want to further understand a certain function or state can achieve cognitive purposes with additional text information.

Adapting for the Platform - Individuality of Top Navigation"></a>2. Adapting for the Platform - Individuality of Top Navigation</h2><p>Consoles, computers, and mobile phones are the three main carriers of games. Due to the differences in their interaction methods, users have different experience habits, which also brings different design focuses.</p>
<p>The operation and display areas of consoles and PCs are separated, so the button prompts and icons on the interface can be made very small, and the arrangement position is also less restricted, and there is no need to worry about blocking or accidental touches during operation. The problems that need to be considered in device adaptation for these two types of carriers are simpler, and there are more free design choices.</p>
<h3 id="PC-Design-that-Breaks-Through-Limitations"><a href="#PC-Design-that-Breaks-Through-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="PC: Design that Breaks Through Limitations"></a>PC: Design that Breaks Through Limitations</h3><p>The biggest advantage of PC games is the mouse. Because the mouse has a hover state, it can directly break through the level, making the display area the interactive space. The interface can bear a huge amount of information and interaction without causing large-scale occlusion. At the same time, the operation accuracy is very high, and the volume of interactive components can be compressed as much as possible, which virtually increases the information capacity of the display area. Compared with the icon-based mobile game function entrance design, the top navigation can use the “text + color block background” entrance presentation method without considering the volume problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2Fcbe6fec6-fb0a-47a1-b304-0c94c6d2d115.png/size/"></p>
<p>In some cases, the mouse may be occupied by other functions and the cursor is not displayed. At this time, the PC can also configure key bindings for the top navigation and display them on the UI. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F291552e9-110a-493b-a2e6-609f3faac33f.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Console-Design-Within-Level-Constraints"><a href="#Console-Design-Within-Level-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Console: Design Within Level Constraints"></a>Console: Design Within Level Constraints</h3><p>Console games are generally interacted with through a controller. Because this type does not use a convenient cursor, the interface pays special attention to levels, and multiple interactions are required to achieve the goal. Many operations (including click&#x2F;slide) of controller games will have corresponding button prompts to deal with various risks during the operation.</p>
<p>Similar to PC, placing the navigation at the top is more in line with the player’s browsing movement and controller key layout, and it is also used more frequently in console games. The top navigation keys are generally configured on the shoulder buttons (L1, R1 or LB, RB), and the corresponding button UI can be drawn in the game to remind players of the operation method. </p>

<p>Some games with double-layer tabs will configure the first-level tabs on the shoulder buttons, which have a relatively short key travel and clear pressing feedback. The secondary tab is configured on the right joystick to facilitate switching with the tab content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F4463cdec-e25b-4b4d-ade2-e236cf9bb197.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>《The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild》</em></p>

<p>In addition, the design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is supplemented by the operation mode of “left joystick + A button”, and a mouse-like operation method is designed. The joystick becomes a mouse, providing players with more convenient choices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F97f45ee2-a713-404a-abd4-712d2a046493.png/size/"></p>

<p>Consoles benefit from their natural carrier advantages, and players have a greater sense of ceremony when playing. The creation of immersion in games on this platform is particularly important, and it is necessary to pay attention to visual, auditory and other aspects of the experience, and the design of sound effects is also more detailed. For example, in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, when switching left and right with the controller, the left and right channels will be distinguished. This subtle design can also highlight the quality and delicacy of the game. </p>

Due to interaction method restrictions, areas where top navigation would generally be placed are outside of operational range, most games would opt for bottom navigation. The top is used to present high-frequency information, for ease of player perusal.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Ace Racer</em> as an example, the lobby interface adopts a bottom-level navigation design, placing high-frequency entrances and the start game button at the bottom right, and displaying information such as currency that needs to be viewed frequently but does not require operation at the top. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F56f30cfe-36cb-4c81-b584-af62472aec7c.jpg/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Game top navigation is a very common functional design, serving its function of filtering and classifying information and displaying entrances. A good top navigation design can greatly reduce the player’s information load and optimize the game operation and cognitive experience. In the development process, designers should design different operation methods according to the characteristics of different terminals, and adjust the design details to achieve the best interactive effect.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230816/28584_1104897.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Southeast Asian game market has always been a must-go place for many manufacturers when expanding overseas, with huge potential. It has also been called the fastest-growing region for the global game market by Newzoo. According to Statista, the total size of the game market in the region was US$5.24 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow to US$6.28 billion by 2024 and US$7.47 billion by 2027.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia has 11 countries, a total population of 650 million, and 380 million Internet users, with an Internet penetration rate of 58%, and this proportion will continue to increase; mobile devices are becoming cheaper and more powerful for Southeast Asian consumers, which also contributes to the fact that more than two-thirds (67%) of the game industry’s revenue in the region comes from mobile devices, while the proportion of PCs is only 24%, and consoles only account for 9%.</p>
<p>Clearly, Southeast Asia is a mobile-first market. As the country with the second-largest GDP in Southeast Asia, Thailand’s 32 million gamers have helped the Thai game market generate more than 6.8 billion RMB in revenue, making it one of the most notable game markets in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As one of the most important countries for domestic games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia, the Thai mobile market has unlimited possibilities. And a full understanding of local users will be a very important factor affecting the success of overseas expansion in this country. Recently, for a game under development, we went to Bangkok, the largest city in Thailand, and two border cities in Thailand, Ubon Ratchathani and Chiang Mai, to conduct in-depth research.</p>
<h2 id="1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand"><a href="#1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand"></a>1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand</h2><p>Before setting off, we collected some data to understand the currently popular games in Thailand. Combined with past research experience, we initially came to the following hypothesis: Thai players like to play games developed by their own country, and in terms of game types, they prefer multiplayer competitive games, especially MOBA, battle royale, MMORPG, and casual games, which have the best revenue in Thailand.</p>
<p>Take the top ten of the iOS best-selling list on April 2, 2023 (from Qimai Data) as an example, including 4 casual games, 1 MOBA game, 2 sports games, 1 MMORPG, and 1 shooting game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F50ec6006-97ab-4000-99c6-56c9be46e107.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Free Fire</em>, published by Garena, one of the largest publishers in Thailand, is very popular; in addition, football mobile games are also very popular in Thailand. <em>eFootball 2023</em> has long occupied the top three of the best-selling list in Thailand, and often competes for the first place.</p>
<h2 id="2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research"><a href="#2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. First-hand Information on Thai Research"></a>2. First-hand Information on Thai Research</h2><h3 id="Thai-Prices"><a href="#Thai-Prices" class="headerlink" title="Thai Prices"></a>Thai Prices</h3><p>According to data from Thai statistical agencies, as the largest city in Thailand, the average monthly salary in Bangkok in 2022 was 22,274 baht (approximately 4,219 RMB). The cost of living in Bangkok is similar to that of second-tier cities in China. A meal can be solved at a street stall for 100 baht, and a meal in a food court in a large shopping mall can be settled for about 200 baht. In addition, the 7-Elevens that can be seen everywhere in Bangkok are also similar in price to domestic convenience stores.</p>
<p>Combined with the average monthly income of Bangkok, residents have a certain amount of entertainment consumption in their disposable income. Mobile games are a very popular form of entertainment for young people in Thailand, and making some recharges in mobile games is also very acceptable to many young people, which is one of the fundamental reasons why the Thai mobile game market is so hot. </p>

<h3 id="Thai-People’s-Travel"><a href="#Thai-People’s-Travel" class="headerlink" title="Thai People’s Travel"></a>Thai People’s Travel</h3><p>Thailand is located in the south-central part of Asia, and it is hot most of the year. It happened to be midsummer when we went, so in many cases, there were fewer people walking on the street, and everyone chose to travel by motorcycle, car, etc. Thai universities generally have a large area, and many students also choose to use motorcycles to travel in school. Based on the characteristics of this national condition, in order to reach more young people and conduct street interviews in Thai universities, we chose more indoor places with a lot of traffic. When there are not many pedestrians on the road, it is difficult to invite students to do user testing and random interviews.</p>
<h3 id="Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand"><a href="#Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand"></a>Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand</h3><p>Different from China, there are few Internet cafes in Thailand and their business hours are short. An Internet cafe we found after walking for more than 20 minutes in Bangkok was only open from 2 pm to 10 pm. Through research, we found that many young people in Thailand said that they basically don’t go to Internet cafes. One of the reasons is that during the epidemic, Internet cafes were strictly controlled. Some people had their own PC devices or started playing mobile games. Combined with the factors such as the high cost performance and rapid technological upgrading of mobile devices, the share of mobile games in Thailand will be much higher than that of PC games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F24f11f92-c390-4933-9313-74f87c7926fd.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Here, in addition to games, the most popular form of entertainment for young people is to gather with friends in board game cafes to play board games, or chat and play games in cafes. Most of these places also provide WIFI. Playing against&#x2F;with friends has also become an important form of entertainment for them. No matter what they do, for many Thai players, having friends together is their most important entertainment condition. This is also one of the reasons why Thai players value social interaction so much in games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F7a8831bd-8ed9-4ff4-871a-eba5bb24329d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Sports-that-Thai-People-Like"><a href="#Sports-that-Thai-People-Like" class="headerlink" title="Sports that Thai People Like"></a>Sports that Thai People Like</h3><p>Thailand can be said to be a country of football. Football-related advertisements can be seen everywhere, and public football fields here are almost all open for free. Because there are many people playing, it is also common to see queues. At present, almost every province, county, and village in Thailand has its own non-professional team, and many schools also have their own school teams. Thai people like to play football and integrate football into their lives, which can also be seen in their TV dramas, movies, and public service advertisements.</p>
<p>The situation we observed in the sports field of the university was that there were only a few people playing basketball at about 4 pm, while there were already more than 10 people playing football. The love of Thai people for football is also reflected in the game market. The reason why the aforementioned <em>eFootball2023</em> can occupy the top three of the mobile game best-selling list for a long time, and even occasionally compete for the first place, is inseparable from the fact that everyone loves this sport and the player base is large. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F9ef059c9-8d17-46ea-85f0-6d9b66acb32a.jpg.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F6dcf136f-947e-418f-a21f-ece66661f79d.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content"><a href="#Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content" class="headerlink" title="Thai People Like Personalized Content"></a>Thai People Like Personalized Content</h3><p>From the perspective of game character selection, some players are not very impressed with some stars and big IPs in the game. On the contrary, they want to get a personalized experience in the game, such as playing a role like themselves in a game. When choosing a map they don’t like, they will also judge it based on reasons such as it being too popular, too common, and wanting a unique scene. On the streets of Bangkok, large-scale graffiti that can be seen everywhere is also a manifestation of personalization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F136baea9-9382-4b19-911b-d9689f231a8a.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Mobile-Device-Selection"><a href="#Mobile-Device-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Device Selection"></a>Mobile Device Selection</h3><p>Among the research group, we found that most users mainly use Android phones, and the price is generally between 1,000 and 3,000 RMB. The price also limits the performance parameters of users’ mobile phones, and the limitation of mobile phone performance will lead to some rigid requirements for players’ choice of games. In addition, similar to other Southeast Asian countries, there are many Android mobile phone manufacturers in the Thai market, with a wide variety of models, and there are also a large number of old machines from many years ago, which also puts certain adaptation and optimization pressure on games that want to expand overseas to Thailand. </p>

<h2 id="3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games"><a href="#3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games"></a>3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games</h2><p>In this research, based on the purpose of the research and previous assumptions, we mainly conducted street interviews on pedestrians on the streets of three cities in Thailand to understand their age, occupation, personal hobbies, game experience, etc. Based on some research results, here is a summary of the factors that Thai players value when choosing games:</p>
<h3 id="Short-Duration"><a href="#Short-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Short Duration"></a>Short Duration</h3><p>Similar to white-collar workers in many countries, the working hours of white-collar workers in Bangkok, Thailand are generally 8-9 am to 5-6 pm, with an hour for lunch, including meals. White-collar workers do not have much time to spend on games during the day on weekdays, and many players tend to choose games with short single play times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F09318b2f-361e-4a35-a216-bd950b3f060d.jpg/size/"></p>

<p><em>Some CBDs have a street of small stalls, and many white-collar workers choose to have lunch here</em></p>

<h3 id="Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles"><a href="#Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles" class="headerlink" title="Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles"></a>Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles</h3><p>The art style is what many Thai players pay attention to first when they see advertisements. Whether they like the art style is an important factor in whether they will download the game. Thai players are more influenced by Japanese and Korean comics in terms of art, and they will prefer games with Japanese and Korean comic art style themes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2Fc5582ae2-38b3-4e4b-97bd-689e41169935.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bookstores in Thailand display many Japanese comics</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Social-Interaction"><a href="#Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Social Interaction"></a>Social Interaction</h3><p>Social interaction is one of the reasons why Thai players pay great attention to when choosing games. Whether they can play with friends, and whether there is enough interaction when playing with friends, are important indicators that affect their choice of a game. Some players believe that even if a game is fun, they will not be able to continue to experience it in depth without friends; and even if a game is not very fond of the subject matter, playing with friends and being able to get a good enough interactive experience can also drive players to follow in the footsteps of their friends and play together. Not only games, but many activities in users’ lives are also for social purposes, such as playing basketball or other sports, which is just a form of gathering with friends.</p>
<h2 id="4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions"><a href="#4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions" class="headerlink" title="4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions"></a>4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions</h2><p>If you also want to do research in Thailand, how should you choose the research method, player recruitment, and research location?</p>
<p>First of all, it is recommended to find places in the target city where the target population may be more concentrated, and conduct preliminary site visits. Take Bangkok as an example, BTS stations, shopping malls, and university campuses are all places with a lot of traffic. However, not all locations are suitable for research. For example, people at BTS stations are in a hurry, and basically no one has time to accept interviews or research, let alone stop to test your game, even for a few minutes. Cafes and board game cafes near shopping malls or universities usually have a lot of free young people, and these places can be considered as priority locations for interviews. However, it should be noted that Thailand has begun to use PDPA laws. If you want to conduct interviews in places with a lot of traffic, you need to submit a written application to the local agency. At the same time, we recommend avoiding conducting research in some popular tourist attractions or airports, where most of the people encountered will be tourists, and it is conceivable that some errors may occur in the research results.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, if there are no professional language personnel, you can choose a local supplier to provide freelancers for Thai language research; if the target group to be researched is relatively fixed, you can also recruit some players who are interested in participating in the research in advance before traveling. For example, if the target group is relatively young, you can contact some suppliers in advance to find players in the university who are interested in games or have similar game experience, and make appointments for all the time before departure, which can greatly improve the efficiency of interviews and research. Pay attention to arranging time for the executing freelancers to train in the interview outline and process to avoid problems such as inadequate implementation and insufficient results in the later stage; if it involves the execution of multiple player studies, after each test, you can promptly review the research situation of the day with the executing personnel, so as to make adjustments to the research plan in time, improve the execution details, and at the same time produce an agile summary, which will be able to complete the research of the day relatively comprehensively.</p>
<p>The important thing about overseas field research is to understand the local situation in advance; before traveling, determine the target population and master the living habits related to the target population and research purpose, such as entertainment methods, travel and consumption preferences, etc. This can improve efficiency in research, save execution time, and ensure the final research results.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, Thailand’s Internet penetration rate is steadily increasing, the population structure is young, and the mobile game market still has great potential for development. It is a must-see place for games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia. This field research on Thai users can help us better understand the different regional markets in Thailand and all aspects of Thai game players, so that our games expanding overseas can better adapt to the local environment, reduce distribution risks, and provide a better game experience for a wider range of overseas players.</p>

    <title>The Third Aspect of Game Localization - How Important is Compliance Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/08/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20230821_28584_1105623/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230821/28584_1105623.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, going global has become an unavoidable battle of strength and resources for Chinese game manufacturers.</p>
<p>The core of a game going global is “localization.” In addition to product, language, style, and cultural localization, understanding and adapting to the laws, regulations, and policies of the local overseas market is also a crucial part of localization.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four main legal compliance issues that deserve attention. First, the market access issue of “games going global”; second, overseas game rating systems; third, the cross-border data flow issue of “games going global”; and fourth, the consumer protection of “games going global.” We will elaborate on these with cases from different countries or regions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Taiwan-China"><a href="#Taiwan-China" class="headerlink" title="Taiwan, China"></a>Taiwan, China</h3><p>Currently, the game market in Taiwan, China is not directly open to mainland companies. The reason is that Taiwan’s “Cross-Strait People’s Relations Regulations” has the following local regulations: “Profit-making enterprises in the mainland area shall not engage in business activities in Taiwan unless they have been approved by the competent authority and have established a branch or office in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>If mainland game manufacturers publish games in Taiwan, they generally choose one of the following two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cooperate with a local agent in Taiwan. For example, a mainland company acts as the game developer, and a Taiwan company acts as the game publisher and operator. According to Taiwan regulations, if the developer, producer, and publisher of the game are mainland-funded, the Taiwan agent should enter the game information and submit proof of agency before the game goes live.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish an overseas company and launch the game in Taiwan through the Apple App Store and Google Play. However, in terms of specific game product promotion and marketing, mainland companies still need to cooperate with Taiwan companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Vietnam"><a href="#Vietnam" class="headerlink" title="Vietnam"></a>Vietnam</h3><p>Games are subject to government approval and licensing. Two licenses are required during the game’s operation: the first is the company’s operating qualification, and the second is the product’s launch license. Vietnam’s game publishing license regulations are relatively strict, and it takes about 6-9 months to apply for this license. However, given the qualifications and government review, not every publisher has sufficient conditions and capabilities to apply for a game license. At the same time, the Vietnamese government’s supervision of mobile games is also stricter than that of China. Therefore, Chinese developers who want to enter Vietnam must thoroughly study the relevant laws of Vietnam to avoid being unable to meet players in the region after making many preparations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems"><a href="#2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Overseas Game Rating Systems"></a>2. Overseas Game Rating Systems</h2><h3 id="South-Korea"><a href="#South-Korea" class="headerlink" title="South Korea"></a>South Korea</h3><p>South Korea strictly implements a game rating system. The GRB rating standards have five levels: All Ages, 18+, 15+, 12+, and Test Level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fb445e865-dc61-4557-ad1c-b50f3a87134e.png/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, what needs special explanation and description is the “Test Level,” which means that game manufacturers can conduct preliminary public tests on the product’s stability and other aspects within 30 days before the official launch of the game product, and the exclusive “Test Level” logo should be placed at this time.</p>
<p>In addition, all games must not only place rating logos, but also display content logos (such as violence logos, tobacco, alcohol, and drug logos, sex logos, etc.) for content in the game that may have negative effects.</p>
<h3 id="Japan"><a href="#Japan" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>A game rating system already exists in the Japanese market. According to relevant Japanese regulations, game software is divided into five levels according to content, and provided to consumers of different ages according to specific ratings. The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) classifies the levels based on whether the game content involves sexual performance, violent performance, anti-social behavior, language or thought, and the specific degree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F28890d5b-2817-49a2-a0e5-b6e507f176e4.png/size/"></p>
<p>With the rise of mobile games, more games are provided to players through app stores. The Apple App Store and Google Play have their own rating standards for the games provided on their platforms. For example, the Apple App Store divides the games that can be listed into four main categories, and requires developers to fill in their own declarations according to the Apple rating standards when reviewing games.</p>
<h3 id="United-States"><a href="#United-States" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>The United States is a pioneer in game rating systems. As early as the early 1990s, the undisguised violence in <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> caused a great backlash from public opinion, prompting the American game industry to unite and try to formulate a game rating system.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States generally implements the ESRB rating system, which is divided into six levels: E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), AO (Adults Only 18+), and RP (Rating Pending). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F6c1ca039-ec29-48a0-957f-5ca9ed70bf9e.png/size/"></p>
<p>The above ratings apply not only to the game content itself, but also to game promotional advertisements. Although the ESRB rating system follows the principle of voluntariness, almost all games in Canada and the United States are rated, otherwise they may not be distributed to the public.</p>
<p>Many players also use the information of the ESRB rating to secretly infer whether a certain game is about to be launched, or the general content direction of the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="United-States-1"><a href="#United-States-1" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>CCPA is the abbreviation of The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. It is another information data protection bill introduced by California, USA on June 28, 2018, and officially implemented on January 1, 2020. It is known as the “strictest and most comprehensive personal privacy protection bill” in the United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fe70ff009-f81e-4f37-88cd-1cae2de5bd78.png/size/"></p>
<p>The jurisdiction principle of CCPA is the principle of personality, that is, it only protects California residents. If every aspect of the game manufacturer’s information collection of players (including the player’s affiliation) is not in California, it is not subject to CCPA. However, since California has a population of more than 40 million, game manufacturers theoretically cannot distinguish whether players are California residents through IP addresses, and California is the most economically developed state in the United States, with the most prosperous Internet and technological innovation. Game manufacturers going global in the United States will inevitably be regulated by CCPA.</p>
<p>The main content of CCPA is actually to give players more control over the collection and management of their personal information by game manufacturers, including but not limited to: the right to know, the right to delete, the right to refuse, the right to opt-in, and the right to opt-out.</p>
<p>If the game manufacturer fails to follow the rules of CCPA, violates its obligations and fails to implement and maintain security procedures and take measures consistent with the nature of the information to protect the player’s personal information, thus suffering unauthorized access and leakage, theft or disclosure, the player can file a civil lawsuit. Game manufacturers may be required to pay each player $100-750 in damages or actual damages (whichever is greater), or face injunctions, etc.</p>
<h3 id="EU"><a href="#EU" class="headerlink" title="EU"></a>EU</h3><p>On May 25, 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), known as the strictest data protection regulation in history, was officially implemented. It puts forward high requirements for enterprises to collect, store, protect, transfer, and use users’ personal information data within the EU. With its wide scope of application and severe penalties, it has aroused widespread concern among Chinese game companies going global. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F06a69c1f-ef55-439b-ad37-315625a62b42.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the GDPR, game companies will be subject to the GDPR in the following situations: First, the game company has an establishment in the EU, regardless of whether its data processing behavior occurs in the EU; second, even if the game company’s place of business is not located in the EU, as long as it provides services to players in the EU (whether or not it charges players), or monitors the behavior of players in the EU.</p>
<p>For game companies going global that are subject to the GDPR, the consequences of violating the bill are very serious. According to Article 83 of the GDPR, the regulatory authority has the right to impose two levels of administrative penalties on enterprises for different illegal acts. The first level can be up to an administrative fine of 10 million euros, or an administrative fine of 2% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher); the second level can be up to an administrative fine of 20 million euros, or an administrative fine of 4% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher). When game companies go global in the EU, they should treat the GDPR bill with caution, and explain the scope of information collection, how it is stored, and how the information will be used in a simple and easy-to-understand form and language before collecting player personal information.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Meta was fined $1.2 billion for violating relevant provisions of the GDPR by transferring user data across borders to the United States, which is also the heaviest fine issued by EU regulators since the bill came into effect.</p>
<h2 id="4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Japan-1"><a href="#Japan-1" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>According to the “Online Game Operation Specifications” formulated by the Japan Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA), games are required to clearly indicate the estimated amount of rare items obtained in the Gacha gameplay (similar to loot boxes) in the Gacha mechanism. The upper and lower limits of the Gacha drop rate must be provided in the Gacha machine; the respective drop rates are provided according to the types of Gacha items, etc.</p>
<p>Such regulations are similar to our domestic regulations on the publicity of draw probabilities - the main purpose is to prevent games from prompting users to overpay with unclear drop probabilities. The difference between the two is that the regulations on probability publicity in China are government regulations, while Japan is a self-regulatory norm of the association. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F3b736d7e-0bd8-4ef0-a6f3-211b5b895651.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>At the same time, in Article 3.1 of Apple’s “App Store Review Guidelines”, it has been clearly stated that apps that provide “loot boxes” or other mechanisms to purchase random virtual items must disclose the odds of obtaining each type of item to customers before they purchase. Therefore, manufacturers that provide games through the Apple App Store also need to comply with the regulation of random draw probability publicity.</p>
<h3 id="United-States-2"><a href="#United-States-2" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>Loot boxes are an effective profit model explored by game manufacturers. Previously, the United States had not passed clear laws and regulations on loot box gameplay to ensure that the rights and interests of players were protected. Even if Hawaii had tried to make efforts, it had not passed any effective bills. Therefore, loot box gameplay is prevalent in the American game market.</p>
<p>But now this one of the world’s largest game markets has begun to legislate. In 2019, Republican lawmakers in the United States formally submitted a bill to Congress to prohibit game manufacturers from opening loot box gameplay to minors. This bill means that in all states of the United States, game companies will no longer be allowed to open loot box gameplay to minors under the age of 18, otherwise they may face corresponding fines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F263945d9-ccca-4c58-8219-ed32593e45a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>Under the influence of this bill, Google added a new policy to Google Play, requiring games to clearly inform players of the drop rate of these items before they pay. At the same time, Google has added more restrictions to gambling games. “Cash and other items of value” that could originally be used as rewards are now strictly limited to “cash and other items of real value.”</p>
<h3 id="Europe"><a href="#Europe" class="headerlink" title="Europe"></a>Europe</h3><p>European countries have also taken measures against the game loot box mechanism.</p>
<p>The Belgian Gaming Commission (BGC) issued a report on game loot boxes, defining this payment system as gambling, and stating that game companies that violate local laws will face fines to imprisonment. This directly led to the region lock of <em>FIFA</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> loot boxes, and Nintendo removed <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> from the Belgian region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fc734fc1d-173d-4e17-a177-efb19a42d856.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the Netherlands, six members of parliament jointly submitted a bill to the House of Representatives to restrict game loot boxes, aiming to prohibit elements such as “loot boxes” and “gacha” from appearing in Dutch games. Members of parliament believe that this gameplay is essentially a kind of gambling, but it is covered with a layer of “micro-transactions” by manufacturers, and there is a possibility of attracting immature children to recharge to obtain benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, Spain has also submitted a new bill to restrict game loot boxes, which also strictly controls “loot boxes” and “gacha” elements, and is even more detailed than the Netherlands. It is reported that Spain’s new bill requires players to provide official age certificates, implement mandatory recharge limits, and require developers to disclose detailed odds of loot drops&#x2F;draws, and impose stricter restrictions on “loot boxes” and “gacha”. Those who do not comply with the new regulations will be fined between 25 and 100 euros.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, game companies going global is both an opportunity and a challenge. If you want to be invincible and forge ahead in the journey of going global, while building your own excellent game product strength, you need to pay attention to the various laws and regulations of the target market, as well as religious, cultural, customs and habits. In addition to completing text and cultural localization, it is necessary to do a good job of product compliance localization, pay attention to market access thresholds, game rating systems, cross-border data flow, and consumer protection issues.</p>

    <title>How Should Game Localization Deal with Slang</title>
    <url>/2023/08/21/netease-ux-articles/news_20230828_28584_1106879/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230828/28584_1106879.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games"></a>1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games</h2><p>“Are you a GG or an MM?” “YYDS” “666” “GG”.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t play games, you can more or less hear these words or phrases in many situations in life. This kind of expression is the so-called “game slang”, most of which originated from the mouths of game players, and basically has some humorous color. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F234e7be8-7321-475f-8637-f40ad7e83037.png/size/"></p>
<p>The so-called “slang” originally referred to some cryptic words created by various groups or communities in the civil society during the feudal society due to their cultural customs and communication needs. It was mainly used by people in the underworld to communicate privately and hide secrets. In modern times, after the development of the Internet, some special terms used on the Internet or in games are also called “Internet slang” or “game slang”.</p>
<p>The Internet and the game world are full of all kinds of players. As the saying goes, “Where there are people, there is a <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, literally “rivers and lakes”, referring to the martial arts world or the underworld)”. Therefore, players who walk in the game <em>jianghu</em> have gradually created sets of unique “game slang” that only people in their own circle can understand.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but many overseas games also have exclusive “slang” and are widely known. For example, “氪金 (kè jīn)” refers to the act of recharging in the game. This word is considered to be a transliteration and misreading of the Japanese word 課金 (かきん - kakīn). In Japanese, 課金 (kakīn) refers to the profit model of using cash to purchase game resources in the game. The transformation from “課金” to “氪金” is not simply because the two are pronounced similarly, but because in the “Burning Crusade” expansion of the game <em>World of Warcraft</em>, a rare ore translated as “Khorium” in the Chinese server was added. Due to its extremely valuable nature, this ore has always had a very high price. Therefore, after the rise of mobile games, some players linked “氪金” and “課金” together, not only because of the pronunciation, but also because of the value of the two. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F2dd420b8-4a89-408b-a897-22ebf52f559a.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear"><a href="#Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Why Does “Slang” Appear?"></a>Why Does “Slang” Appear?</h3><p>The reasons for the emergence of slang are diverse. One reason can be attributed to the fact that the names of equipment and skills in the game are too long, and they are not smooth to say in actual combat. For example, in the game <em>EVE Online</em>, game terms such as Warp Scrambler and Stasis Webifier are too tongue-twisting. When playing the game, saying the full name will affect the command, etc. Therefore, for convenience, these equipment will be referred to according to the equipment effect or the abbreviation of the equipment name. For example, the slang of the Warp Scrambler mentioned above is “long point” (长反 - cháng fǎn) because it has a longer range, but the warp disruption strength caused is lower, and it cannot close the microwarpdrive. In addition to weapons, equipment, and skills, players will also “attack” the names of heroes. Many games have also given many “slang names” to some heroes due to players’ consensus on the appearance, skills, and background of these heroes.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see from the above that the “slang” that appears in the game is generally for the convenience of players to communicate when playing. In a fast-paced online game, players generally do not have much time to type, and the game itself only provides some very simple signals to help players communicate quickly. Therefore, players will invent “slang”, which is generally short and vivid.</p>
<p>Of course, the emergence and spread of game slang cannot be separated from the “humorous and comedic” effect. When a particular expression can achieve a strong comedic effect in a certain situation, players will start to use it frequently in other similar scenes. Coupled with the entertainment attributes of the game itself, this slang will naturally begin to spread widely.</p>
<h2 id="2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games"><a href="#2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games"></a>2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games</h2><p>Most overseas and domestic games have unique “slang” tables, including everything from in-game character names to game items, to various sentences and words used by players when communicating in the game community, as well as their abbreviations and nicknames. We will take the Chinese, Japanese, and English versions of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as the main examples to summarize the frequently appearing game “slang” and their meanings.</p>
<p>As a multiplayer online game with a multiplayer team mode, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has also spawned a lot of “slang” in social aspects. In addition to text, this “slang” also exists in the form of emoji and kaomoji, which plays a great role in player communication in the game community.</p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>’s Chinese server duos or trios teams, you often hear words like “帮我拆火 (bāng wǒ chāi huǒ - help me break the fire)”, “咱们去空投 (zán men qù kōng tóu - let’s go to the airdrop)”, “猛蓄猛出 (měng xù měng chū - fierce charge and release)”, “压力怪 (yā lì guài - pressure monster)”, “拉我 (lā wǒ - pull me)” and so on. These slang words may sound confusing to players who don’t play this game, but they are familiar to veteran players. The word “拆火” means to help teammates fight against the enemy and interfere when teammates are attacked by the enemy, so as to achieve the purpose of dispersing firepower. “空投” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> refers to the supplies dropped in the safe zone, “Airdrop”. The meaning of “猛蓄猛出” is easy to understand, referring to players who only charge and release directly. “压力怪” does not mean that they feel a lot of pressure, but usually refers to people who “put pressure” on their teammates in the game to achieve their own emotional venting. There are many ways to exert pressure, such as verbal pressure (ridicule, abuse) and behavioral pressure (malicious interference), etc. Chinese server players even change the part of speech of the name “压力” into a verb, creating new “slang” in the form of “pressure teammates”. </p>

<p><em>Some of the Slang in Naraka: Bladepoint</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When studying the “slang” of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s English and Japanese regions, we found that the “slang” used by overseas players when chatting in the game community is mostly abbreviations of daily expressions and game terms, followed by emoji. We have summarized some of them in the table below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2Fd3a1b446-c56a-45c1-8beb-2c82a1789e6d.png/size/"></p>

Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process"></a>3. Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process</h2><p>It can be seen from the table above that the “slang” in English and Japanese includes abbreviations, generalizations and codes of game terms and daily expressions. There are also direct use of pictures, such as emoji, or kaomoji to express one’s feelings more vividly.</p>
<p>Some of these “slang” are even very similar to those we use in China. For example, English players will use “rmb” to refer to the “right mouse button” in the game, and Japanese players will use “草 (kusa - grass)” to express “laugh” or “www” (the Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter sounds). However, it should be noted that although the two are very similar and even written the same way, their meanings are completely different in different language environments. In addition, “slang” is often concise, obscure, and targeted. Not to mention foreign players, some new players in the server do not understand it at all. Therefore, in the process of game localization translation, how to translate these “slang” so that players of the corresponding language can also quickly understand the meaning it conveys and facilitate smoother communication between players has become a major challenge in the localization process.</p>
<h3 id="Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries"><a href="#Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries"></a>Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries</h3><p>Different regions have different cultures. The differences between one culture and other cultures constitute cultural barriers, which are mainly reflected in the differences in language, way of thinking, customs, religious beliefs, moral standards, political and legal systems, and outlook on life, world outlook, and values. In the localization process of a game dominated by multiplayer gameplay, the localization team needs to consider the convenience of communication between players, and focus on translating by studying the cultural characteristics of the target area and the style of “slang” in other games in the area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F1676f96a-6fdf-461b-9a97-fcc9f80c12f6.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Unlike in other countries, GG in China has a negative connotation.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In English-speaking regions, players are more inclined to abbreviate in-game props and terms, or abbreviate two words after splicing them together to achieve the purpose of fast typing and communication; Japanese players tend to create “slang” based on the characteristics of game terms (appearance, etc.) combined with local culture. As mentioned above, “Fiddlesticks” is called “かかし (kakashi)” because “かかし (kakashi)” originally means scarecrow in Japanese, and the surname of “Kakashi Hatake” in <em>Naruto</em> is “Hatake”, which can be translated as “rice field”. Therefore, Japanese players will associate the two. In addition, many “草 (kusa)” Internet buzzwords suddenly appeared in Japan in 2022 because the Romaji of “笑 (warai - laugh)” in Japanese is “warau”, so “www” is used to express laughter, and “w” looks like a bunch of grass, so “笑 (warai)” is replaced by “草 (kusa)” in Japanese Internet buzzwords.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to translate the “slang” in the game well, you must first be among the player groups, understand the local culture, and understand what kind of terms players in the target market will use in their daily lives, and what the structure of these terms is. When literal translation is not possible, by tracing the composition of the term and translating its origin, the word can be translated more accurately. This requires actively participating in the community of the target language during localization, mastering the rules of “slang” in a large number of daily communication with players, becoming familiar with the local culture, understanding the cultural differences between the two countries, and striving to break through cultural barriers.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>At present, domestic games are booming in overseas markets, but for mature markets such as Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States, local game manufacturers or global top manufacturers have generally been deeply involved for many years and have strong competitive barriers. Coupled with the cultural differences between the two places, the competitiveness of the overseas expansion of domestic games has gradually increased. Domestic games can build a bridge of communication between players of the two languages through localization, reduce cultural barriers through localization, spread excellent culture, so that games not only “go out” overseas, but also “stand firm”. Through localization, games can be culturally empowered, and appropriate “slang” can form another link between games and players, and players and players.</p>

    <title>How Localization Shapes Character Image - Taking Japanese Localization as an Example</title>

<h2 id="1-Localization-and-Character-Image"><a href="#1-Localization-and-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="1. Localization and Character Image"></a>1. Localization and Character Image</h2><p>Localization is the process of adapting a product or service to the differences of different markets. It is often confused with translation, but it actually goes far beyond the scope of translation. Translation is only one of several services that make up the localization process.</p>
<p>In addition to translation, the localization process may also include adjusting graphics according to the target market, modifying the content layout to adapt to the translated text, converting to local currency, using the correct date, address, and data formats, adapting to local regulations, interface and skin adjustments, etc. The object of localization is the “product”, not just the “text”; this process also includes two aspects: language and culture (including social background).</p>
<p>In the localization of game products, the process is, in a sense, a re-creation of the game content (such as character image). There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes. Even people in the same language environment cannot reach a consensus on the same thing, and it is even more difficult for people in different languages and regions to have the same understanding of the same thing. Therefore, in addition to the character image created by the original language, the shaping of the character image by the target language is particularly important.</p>
<p>A successful re-creation of the character image must be an indispensable part of successful localization. However, while re-creating the character image, the localization process must not deviate from the original image of the character (that is, the character image in the original language). This is because localization not only needs to meet the requirements of the target market, but also needs to carry the information of the original language and the original game itself. In this way, how to shape a “new image” that is close to the character’s original image becomes a problem. This is a challenge of “dancing in shackles”, and it is also an opportunity to gain both overseas market revenue and the inheritance of national culture.</p>
<h2 id="2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture"><a href="#2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture"></a>2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture</h2><h3 id="Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits"><a href="#Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits"></a>Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits</h3><p>The localization of the language itself is often understood as localization translation, which is only one aspect. When it comes to the standards of Chinese people for translation, it is impossible to avoid Yan Fu’s “faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance” mentioned in “Evolution and Ethics”. In the process of localizing the background, plot, lines, etc. related to the character image, this standard will also be referred to. “Faithfulness means truth, and truth means non-falsehood; expressiveness means attainment, and attainment means neither excess nor deficiency; elegance means literariness, and literariness means being elegant when it should be elegant and being vulgar when it should be vulgar.”</p>
<p>Lawrence Venuti put forward the concepts of domestication and foreignization in his book <em>The Translator’s Invisibility: A History of Translation</em>. Domestication emphasizes reducing the sense of strangeness in the target language, while foreignization preserves the exotic elements in the original language.</p>
<p>In language localization, if you want to ensure that the character image is close to the prototype, you must first ensure the correctness of the language itself, including no grammatical errors, no deviations in word interpretation. This is the basis of all localization and translation. If the foundation is not strong, the character image on the upper level will also shake. After ensuring the correctness of the language itself, what needs to be done is “expressiveness”, neither excess nor deficiency.</p>
<p>In the current era of big data, with the help of AI translation and the excellent quality monitoring of the localization team, the correctness and quality of the language can be well guaranteed in most cases and scenarios, so “faithfulness” and “expressiveness” are no longer difficult.</p>
<p>The final “elegance” is the key factor that determines whether a localization result is of high quality in this era. How to analyze, discuss, and reshape the style, usage habits, and the character image behind the original language, and apply it to the target language, so that the target language population (that is, game players in countries and regions that use the target language) can feel that the translated language is not awkward, then it can be called a successful localization.</p>
<p>For example, in the Japanese original of <em>Blue Archive</em>, Iori calls Aiko “アコちゃん”, which is often translated as “A-ko chan” in anime scenarios, but the localization team of the simplified Chinese version translated it as “Aya”(亚亚). Obviously, the localization here removes the influence of Japanese usage habits without reducing Iori’s original intimacy with the members of the Gehenna Prefect Team. This localized translation even reminds people of the names of giant pandas, which has a strong Chinese flavor. In a sense, it can be called a successful localization attempt. </p>

<h3 id="Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors"><a href="#Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors"></a>Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors</h3><p>Cultural localization is different from language localization. If language localization requires the character image to be as close as possible to the target language user group, then cultural localization requires the character image to maintain a certain distance from the target group in some aspects. In our view, we must provide players with a reason to play our games.</p>
<p>Why would a player in a country choose not to play their own country’s games, but to choose a game from a foreign manufacturer? There can be many reasons for this, such as rich gameplay&#x2F;playability, extremely high picture quality, vivid story background&#x2F;character plot, comprehensive user service, etc. Of course, many players themselves are only loyal to the game category and overall quality, and do not care about the developer’s region. However, in the world of games, which highly emphasizes subjective user experience, how to enter the player’s mind is decisive. At this time, if a game can bring players a foreign cultural experience that starts with curiosity and ends with dissemination, it can clearly distinguish this game from other games; and it is this differentiation that can make a game from a foreign country for players stand out. At this time, the character image should be closer to the background story of the original language, rather than the environment of the target language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230904%2F04f8d0ab-8f9a-4886-9659-6ab5b04698eb.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, in the preheating story of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Yoto Hime, there is such a passage: “Beast?” The girl seemed to have heard something very interesting, and couldn’t help laughing softly.</p>
<p>The first version of the Japanese translation was: 「ペット？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>However, considering that <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is based on a fictional ancient Chinese fantasy and martial arts world, the word ペット in Japanese is derived from the English word pet, which reflects the epitome of English’s influence in the world. Therefore, after consideration, we changed this passage to:</p>
<p>「飼い犬？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>Here, 飼い犬 is often translated as a domestic dog, which is closer to the Eastern worldview of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> than pet, and the character image of Yoto Hime in this worldview can be better shaped. Indeed, in terms of language usage habits, for Japanese people, the word pet is more commonly used and more everyday than domestic dog. But as mentioned above, how can a game localization that cannot be distinguished from other games and cannot bring players a sense of foreign culture break through the vast game market today? Therefore, the localization process here must follow the principle of foreignization of historical and cultural factors to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Looking back, the translation of “Aya” in <em>Blue Archive</em> mentioned above does achieve language localization, but it seems to have eliminated most of the cultural perception of anime, which may bring some players a sense of separation between the picture and the characters.</p>
<h2 id="3-Successful-Localization-Cases"><a href="#3-Successful-Localization-Cases" class="headerlink" title="3. Successful Localization Cases"></a>3. Successful Localization Cases</h2><p>How do successful cases make the character image more popular with the local audience through localization? Here are some examples of Japanese localization and translation to better understand the two key points of shaping the character image: domestication of language usage habits and foreignization of historical and cultural factors.</p>
<p>Yoto Hime of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is portrayed in the game as a princess&#x2F;lady whose underlying logic is to find “fun”. Therefore, there are a lot of Japanese final particles (language usage habits) such as わ, よ, かしら, じゃない in the script to reflect this princess persona. The following is also a passage from Yoto Hime’s preheating story:</p>
<p>“He said yesterday that he never believed in ghosts and gods. I wanted to see if it was true~ Who knew that it would be amazing once I tried. I can’t really accept him as a disciple, so I had to let this beggar receive his bows for me.”</p>
<p>「あの奴、昨日自分で言ったでしょ、鬼神の説を信じていないって。だから本当かどうかを見てみたいわ。試した結果、大変なことになっちゃったわよ。ほら、私は彼を本当に弟子にするのもいかないし、物乞いくんに拝礼を受けてもらうしかないわ。」</p>
<p>However, in the first version of the preheating story, this persona was only reflected in Yoto Hime’s actions in the plot, and her unique style was not shown in her lines. After discussion by the localization team, these simple modal final particles were finally added according to Yoto Hime’s persona in the script, shaping Yoto Hime who is close to the original persona at the language level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230904%2F3ed77793-f22e-4be9-a882-87b723f15344.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In all the above examples, it seems that the localization discusses and纠结s over only one or two words or pronunciations. In fact, whether it is the image of a character, or the game background and world created by various characters, and even the entire game, will be affected by these seemingly insignificant, accumulated details. The character image reshaped by localization must show the characteristics of being close to the original language but not rigid, and being compatible with the target language but vivid in insignificant places.</p>
<p>Therefore, in localization work, the more insignificant the place, the more effort should be made to ensure the rigor of the localization work. Although the behavior of the character itself is ever-changing, the behavioral logic behind the character should be consistent, and the identity of the character we create should also be the same and continuous. The consistency of the appropriate expression of the same thing between different languages is also something we should firmly grasp.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Text in games runs through the core gameplay and functional interfaces at all levels. The information transmission and emotional expression it achieves are key elements in game interaction. This article analyzes the characteristics of font design in excellent game works at home and abroad under different themes, and discusses how to choose the basic tone of fonts and the integration of font design and game worldview according to the style of different games. In addition, we will also explain the relevant information about game font localization and commercial costs. These contents are intended to provide game developers with ideas and references for font selection and design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Font-Classification"><a href="#1-Font-Classification" class="headerlink" title="1. Font Classification"></a>1. Font Classification</h2><p>There are many ways to classify fonts, such as handwriting, printing, and artistic fonts… etc. The most discussed classification method is “serif and sans-serif”. In layman’s terms, serifs are also known as “feet”. Serif fonts are fonts with corner decorations. As can be clearly seen from the figure below, at the same font size, the angular sans-serif font looks larger and clearer than the serif font. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F74e0f603-d52b-494c-9f8f-140a84d15820.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1. Comparison of Serif and Sans-serif Fonts</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Serif"><a href="#Serif" class="headerlink" title="Serif"></a>Serif</h3><p>It is generally believed that serif fonts originated from Roman stone inscriptions. The modern explanation for these decorative strokes, which is accepted by most people, comes from Father Edward Catich’s book “The Origin of the Serif”. The book believes that Roman letters were first written with a square-tipped brush before being carved into stone tablets. Due to the use of a square-tipped brush, the strokes would have uneven strokes at the beginning and end, so finishing actions were added at the beginning, end, and corners of the strokes. The engravers carved according to the written samples, which naturally formed the “serif” serif font.</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese characters, such as Song typeface, at the junction of strokes, the beginning of vertical strokes and the end of horizontal strokes, due to the return and pause of the brush when writing calligraphy, a unique triangular structure is formed, which can also be called “serif”.</p>
<h3 id="Sans-serif"><a href="#Sans-serif" class="headerlink" title="Sans-serif"></a>Sans-serif</h3><p>In the era of electronic screens, the display of Chinese characters does not need the original function of “serif” but only retains its decorative nature. However, in the case of a large amount of text information input&#x2F;output on the Internet, too many embellishments on the strokes of serif fonts can easily cause visual fatigue. Sans-serif fonts, contrary to serif fonts, have no decorative lines or small horizontal lines similar to “small feet” in their glyphs, and the text is usually composed of mechanical and uniform lines.</p>
<p>There is no unified rule when choosing fonts, but there are some default norms. For example, long-form reading or small-screen information displays prefer to use sans-serif fonts; while titles or small-scale texts prefer serif fonts to enhance the beauty of short sentences. Moreover, in many scenarios, more irregular artistic fonts are needed to render the atmosphere of the game or achieve specific effects.</p>
<h2 id="2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="2. Selection of Game Fonts"></a>2. Selection of Game Fonts</h2><h3 id="Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone"><a href="#Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Game Style Determines the Basic Tone"></a>Game Style Determines the Basic Tone</h3><p>In the selection and design of game fonts, it is necessary to consider the game style, type, main audience, and the good integration within the different systems in the game and the game worldview. However, there are many ways to classify game styles, and it is difficult to find a specific classification method to cover all game types and styles. Here, some examples with obvious contrasts are used to illustrate the differences in the form of different fonts and the selection principles.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay type, games that are more mysterious and magical usually prefer serif fonts, while action games that emphasize fast pace and dynamism will prefer sans-serif fonts to reflect a crisp power; Chinese style games and styles that are more realistic and nostalgic always prefer serif fonts to create a real, profound and immersive atmosphere; while sci-fi and anime games emphasize exploration and technology, and choosing sans-serif fonts will be more compatible with them; for children’s games, cartoon and simple sans-serif fonts are usually the first choice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Fb69f3fab-2b2e-4f3e-b712-fc3c6a2d4900.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 2. Different style classifications of games and the types of fonts that can be selected</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If the worldview of the game has not been determined during the design process, you can initially choose a suitable basic font tone by combining the keyword list provided in the figure below. Generally speaking, sans-serif fonts are suitable for modern, concise, technological and other game styles; while serif fonts are more suitable for traditional, ancient, Gothic fantasy and other game styles. There is no clear boundary for the selection of fonts. On the basis of ensuring information transmission, it is often pursued to create a visual performance effect that is more in line with the game worldview. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Fb87fd352-5e34-4c39-8718-a2ade52a46ad.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. Correspondence between game style keywords and font selection recommendations</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, choosing sans-serif or serif as the main font of the game does not mean that all text content in the game is immutable. There are also various font classifications in the game, and it is often necessary to mix and use multiple fonts.</p>
<h3 id="System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts"><a href="#System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="System Fonts and Artistic Fonts"></a>System Fonts and Artistic Fonts</h3><p>Whether it is a serif font or a sans-serif font, it needs to be authorized before it can be legally used as the system font of the game. Due to the size and compression restrictions of the game package, too many fonts cannot be placed in the game, and usually one font is selected for each of the title font and the system font. However, it would be a bit monotonous if all the text in the game only uses the system font, so developers need to make a trade-off in the use of fonts.</p>
<p>In order to meet some special needs in the game, such as event titles, game names, etc., developers may need to use some artistic fonts or handwritten fonts. Artistic fonts are sometimes deformations and modifications of existing fonts, and sometimes they are more complex changes; while handwritten fonts are usually more natural, softer, and more stylized, and sometimes designed by professional calligraphers.</p>
<p>So, how should we choose system fonts or artistic fonts? We should consider the role of text in the game. Text with different functions will have different designs and processing methods. In general, the fewer types of fonts used in game interface design, the better. As much as possible, visual hierarchy principles, such as different weights, styles, sizes, directions, positions, and colors of fonts, should be used to reflect differences in importance.</p>
<h3 id="Integration-with-the-In-Game-World"><a href="#Integration-with-the-In-Game-World" class="headerlink" title="Integration with the In-Game World"></a>Integration with the In-Game World</h3><p>● <strong>Main System Font - Integration</strong></p>
<p>The system fonts in the game, such as game menus, game situation, task information, etc., as a strong functional existence, provide players with a series of main information such as character data, items, levels, and task objectives. Part of this information will always appear on the main game interface, such as the game’s HUD (Heads-up Display). The display of another part of the information involves interaction with other functional controls or changes in interaction levels. In both cases, designers need to think about how to integrate the text in the game with other visual hierarchy structures. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4. Precautions and examples of game system font design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Designers often simplify the text information in the game HUD to make the most important information or functions visually visible. However, when players open the menu bar and other secondary interfaces, they often need to read and digest a large amount of data information at one time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F48cf773a-997b-4907-8943-e86c7865292d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5. HUD design considerations and case sharing</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When page level jumps or Tab switching is required, in order to avoid a blunt transition between the scene interface and the text interface, usually not only the font itself is used to match the style, but different dynamic effects, display styles, art packaging, and font effect designs are used to add visual effects. In the selection of fonts, it is necessary to make subtle distinctions based on primary and secondary information, but it should not be too fragmented. This can create a more coherent and harmonious gaming experience. </p>

<p>● <strong>Subtitles and Dialogue - Role Immersion</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle text is an indispensable part of games with storylines. It can play a role in promoting the plot and helping players enter the role. The design of subtitles needs to avoid stealing the limelight of the picture, and at the same time, it needs to ensure that the font is clear and visible. This requires that the font should not be too compact or too small to increase the difficulty of reading and understanding, and at the same time, it should not be too long or occupy too much space, so as not to affect the advancement of the game plot and the immersive experience of the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F52f7c7d8-97ac-4bfb-8f50-1dabda9fbe42.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 7. Precautions and examples of game dialogue and subtitle design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Posters and Packaging - Brand Impression</strong></p>
<p>Using the system default font can meet the text needs on the conventional interface, but it is slightly inferior to some special occasions that require exaggerated design font effects. The game logo and promotional posters are important identifiers of the game brand, and are the first impression of a game. They need to clearly convey the core concept and characteristics of the game, and at the same time, they should also provide players with a reference standard for the overall tone of the game. Many game logos consist only of the game name, which requires that they cannot be too complicated, otherwise it will increase the difficulty of memory, and at the same time, they need to be highly stylized. In addition, when designing, it is also necessary to consider the logo changes in different languages to ensure that the game has better awareness and playability in different regions and cultures.</p>
<p>At this time, we need to use custom fonts, which are what we often call artistic fonts. Artistic fonts require artists to make a separate picture text and paste it in a designated position to replace the traditional text. This picture text often contains exaggerated deformation of the original font, adding a unique style and avoiding infringement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Ff10ee232-56ad-48d7-af00-2f2b21879769.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 8. Precautions and examples of game packaging and LOGO design</em></p>

<p>● <strong>Core Gameplay Font - Motivation and Ritual</strong></p>
<p>In the design of core gameplay, how to balance a large amount of related information and the display of main information is very important. In the case of a fast-paced core gameplay, it is necessary to first clarify the importance of information grading, and select the corresponding game font style and arrangement method according to different gradings. In addition, in the core gameplay, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of non-static factors such as dynamic effects and scenes on the transmission of text information, so as to better convey information.</p>
<p>Almost all games have initialization and settlement settings. How to stimulate the player’s motivation and sense of ritual, and provide just the right sense of frustration when necessary, so that they can re-challenge the task, is a key issue that interface designers need to focus on. The font design at this time often pursues the first-time instinctive perception of information, rather than the content conveyed by the text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F3f494623-94cf-4ab8-b423-88407feeca26.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Figure 9. Precautions and examples of game core gameplay information transmission design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Summary - Balance of Readability and Stylization</strong></p>
<p>Through the analysis of this section, it can be found that the main goals of different types of fonts in the game to transmit information are also different. The selection of the overall game font needs to pay attention to the balance of readability and stylization.</p>
<p>For the system fonts in the game, the primary goal is to clearly convey information. At this time, it is necessary to focus on improving readability and legibility without affecting the continuity of the player’s operation and causing a lack of immersion.</p>
<p>For the artistic fonts in the game, it is more to highlight the personality of the game, attract the attention, recognition and interest of players. The readability of these artistic fonts is not always the higher the better. Sometimes appropriately weakening the font content and strengthening its visual impact, achieving the integration of text information and dynamic effects, etc., can deepen the player’s immersion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fonts in the game also need to follow certain principles. For example, in game design, information at the same level needs to be unified in terms of font size, color, font shape, and font style to reduce the user’s identification and cognitive burden. In addition, the legibility and usability of the font are very important. Doing this well can avoid causing reading or operation obstacles to the player, affecting the fluency of the game experience, and thus making more contributions to retention.</p>
<h2 id="3-Game-Font-Localization"><a href="#3-Game-Font-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3. Game Font Localization"></a>3. Game Font Localization</h2><p>When different readers see this article, the display font comes from your specific system, and the system font libraries of different platforms often differ, which will lead to differences in the reading experience of the same product on different platforms. For a product like a game that focuses on the overall experience, calling the fonts of the system platform sometimes has two problems:</p>
<p>● In a single-language system, if localization is not performed, it may cause the font to fail to display, rare fonts to be missing or garbled, etc., destroying the original beauty of the interface, affecting understanding, and causing players to lose immersion.</p>
<p>● When it comes to multi-language systems, it is necessary to ensure that the selected font is equipped with a complete character set for each language and can be presented in a clear and aesthetically pleasing way. Localization at this time not only needs to consider the accuracy of the translation, but also needs to consider the impact of factors such as market development, user habits, cultural and religious differences on the acceptance of the product.</p>
<p>This article only discusses the problem of inconsistent font display. The solution to this problem is to copy the font to the project and let the engine support reading the font from its own project, so that the platform difference can be eliminated and the design effect can be displayed consistently on all platforms. This is the current solution for various game engines. Some game studios may produce or purchase new system fonts for specific regions to meet the needs of different language regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F91df51ac-2461-4476-8d64-8869dc75f4bd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 10. Localization problems and solutions currently faced</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For designers, there are two aspects of font localization that are worth thinking about:</p>
<p>● For special language symbols, it is necessary to consider the production method of picture words and the replacement under different languages, and pay attention to the possible changes in size and estimated distance, and provide a consistent and complete game experience on different types of devices.</p>
<p>● When arranging text such as tabs or titles, fully consider the impact of different language habits on the visual effect. For example, a vertical arrangement that can be clearly displayed in Chinese or Japanese may not be suitable for Western languages. The writing style of Arabic is from right to left, and it is necessary to consider the arrangement and alignment in special cases, and also to consider the impact of the differences in reading habits of different players on the game experience.</p>
<p>As game development progresses rapidly, many designers are committed to solving these problems, so many excellent developer plugins have emerged, such as the Unity plugin “ThunderFire UX Tool”. ThunderFire UX Tool localization tool supports the configuration and content replacement of 14 languages including Thai and Arabic. It can import and identify multi-language text and artistic font pictures with one click, and can quickly preview and switch in the editor, providing a complete set of procedural localization and font solutions for interaction, translation, and programming. </p>

<h2 id="4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts"></a>4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts</h2><p>When choosing game fonts, commercial costs usually include design, licensing, and maintenance costs. Developers need to budget and plan within a reasonable range and comply with relevant licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Game font licensing is usually divided into two types: game image licensing and game embedding. Game image licensing applies the image form of the font to game software or poster products, the price is relatively low, and the frequency of use is low. Game embedding is to embed the font as a whole into the game system as a system font, and the price is higher. Game embedding needs to meet more usage specifications and requirements, including the stability and compatibility of the font in the game system. The licensing price will also vary according to the completeness of the font family package and the national standard type.</p>
<p>The specific licensing price will also be affected by the font design itself, such as the exquisiteness of the font, the copyright period, popularity, and aesthetics. Therefore, when conducting font licensing, developers need to fully communicate and negotiate with the font licensor to determine a reasonable licensing price and usage method, and scope of application.</p>
<p>When borrowing unlicensed fonts, it is necessary to pay attention to the deformation of the fonts to avoid violating relevant agreements. When it is necessary to use fonts similar to picture fonts in the game, fonts with very large deformations are often used to make artistic fonts to increase the aesthetics and reduce the risk of use.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>For game players, excellent font selection and design can allow players to easily understand the text information in the game without causing doubts. Sometimes, the player’s ignorance of the text in the game can reflect the success of the text design. Developers choosing the right font not only needs to consider the coordination of the game’s worldview and the overall style of the game, but also needs to consider multi-dimensional issues such as font iteration authorization and localization to enhance the quality and user experience of the game.</p>

    <title>Expanding Design Principles: How Does Emotion Affect Game Experience?</title>
    <url>/2023/09/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20231008_28584_1113540/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231008/28584_1113540.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>With the maturity of product design and manufacturers’ development capabilities, users are increasingly paying attention to the emotional experience that products bring to them. At the same time, more and more games are not only pursuing momentary excitement, pure visual and operational experience, but also fully considering and satisfying users’ emotional needs as much as possible, and are more pursuing users’ spiritual pleasure, value and emotional recognition. This article will start from the perspective of emotional design, explore its role and application methods in the field of game experience design, in order to optimize user experience through emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Emotional-Design"><a href="#1-What-is-Emotional-Design" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Emotional Design?"></a>1. What is Emotional Design?</h2><p>Emotions are complex and changeable, but the patterns that cause emotions are general and regular; and emotional design is to use these patterns to purposefully cause people’s emotional reactions, through various shapes, colors, textures and other modeling elements, emotions are integrated into the game experience, in the process of consumers experiencing products, to stimulate people’s associations, resonate, and obtain spiritual pleasure and emotional satisfaction.</p>
<p>Emotion is a mandatory and oppressive experience. Converting consumers’ activities, thoughts, feelings, desires, goals, habits, and values into design will trigger positive emotional responses from users. The book “Emotional Design” clearly divides design and design goals into three levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective, and expounds the important position and role of emotion in design. It serves as a conceptual supplement in the fields of software, interaction, and game design. Therefore, when we design any product, we need to respect emotional needs and bring a deeper level of quality experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h2 id="2-The-Role-of-Emotional-Design-in-Experience-Design"><a href="#2-The-Role-of-Emotional-Design-in-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. The Role of Emotional Design in Experience Design"></a>2. The Role of Emotional Design in Experience Design</h2><h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Visceral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Visceral Experience</h3><p>The visceral level refers to the sensory stimulation that the product brings to people. The emotional response that the product looks, sounds, and feels to the user is the first step for design to generate value. Through the design of pictures, colors, layouts, sounds, textures, and tactile feedback, the product features can be visually reflected and bring specific emotional experiences to users.</p>
<p>For example, the beautiful pictures in the game make people feel dazzling and colorful, or red reminds people of blood, sun, and fire, giving people a feeling of excitement, jumping, and alertness, causing physiological excitement and stimulation. These are all visceral designs of the game that are acting on the visual experience of players.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience</h3><p>The behavioral level refers to the fact that users must learn and master skills, use skills to solve problems, and trigger emotions, gain a sense of accomplishment and pleasure from the experience. It is aimed at the user’s experience. For example, in the game, players need to gradually master the game rules preset by the designer, and use them to fight against other players or computer opponents to strive for victory. The experience of the behavioral layer is the core of game interaction design, which can allow users to obtain a positive emotional experience. Therefore, it is necessary to provide clear goals, instant feedback, and appropriate challenges; it is necessary to design an easy-to-understand conceptual model that conforms to the four elements of function, ease of understanding, ease of use, and physical feeling of behavioral design, so that users can use it easily, and always pay attention to the user’s experience throughout the process.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb3f3464b-e46f-4f61-8073-738c16162324.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Reflective Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Reflective Experience</h3><p>Finally, there is the reflective layer, which refers to the deeper emotions, consciousness, understanding, personal experience, cultural background and other influences that are intertwined in the user’s heart due to the effects of the first two levels, the user transforms and associates certain potential information and characteristics contained in things, and projects them into life experience. For games, the content of the game and the implied information conveyed by the storyline will stimulate players to recall and reflect, integrating out-of-game experience and in-game feelings to create a more immersive experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F4497f049-5551-4794-ad3c-7a3539aacfc6.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Revelation M》 Guild News, Meteor Shower Treasure Chests Create an Immersive Experience</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The experience brought to users by excellent reflective emotional design determines the connotation, meaning and user stickiness of the product; when the emotional experience meets the user’s long-term goals and conveys a clear and consistent personality, it is more likely that users will truly like such an experience in a meaningful way, and voluntarily and actively form a lasting and loyal connection with the brand or IP.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Use-Emotional-Design-to-Create-Game-Experience"><a href="#3-How-to-Use-Emotional-Design-to-Create-Game-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience"></a>3. How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience</h2><h3 id="Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience"><a href="#Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience"></a>Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience</h3><p>At the visceral level, physical characteristics—visual, auditory, and tactile—dominate, so creating visual, auditory, and tactile appeal is an important factor in getting users’ favor and attracting users’ attention at the visceral level of the game.</p>
<p>So how to create multi-sensory appeal?</p>
<p>Designers can refine relevant characteristic elements, such as regional characteristics, character characteristics, etc., to expand the game from pure senses and aesthetics to the fields of semantics and culture, occupy users’ cognitive resources at the visceral level, guide users’ emotions, and attract users’ attention. Among them, vision, as the most basic perception channel, is the beginning of the user’s game experience. Using characteristic elements familiar to users can stimulate users’ “value resonance”, thereby affecting the generation of immersive emotional experience.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>All-Star Streetball Party</em>, the exquisite interface design incorporates a large number of street basketball elements. From the personalized graffiti-style interface to the cool and trendy sneakers and fashions, these elements contain the collective memory of basketball fans and can also attract general users who are interested in streetball culture. These elements can quickly occupy users’ cognitive resources from the visual channel, arouse associations and imagination, activate users’ sensory systems, and attract users’ attention at the visceral level.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Sound evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>For a game, sound is also an important way for players to obtain information and emotions. Try to recall a game you like. Whether it attracts you with exciting battles, beautiful scenes, or touching plots, it is inseparable from the support and enhancement of sound: background music allows players to feel the changes in scenes and environments, skill sound effects allow players to feel the pleasure of battle, and character voices allow players to feel the personality and emotions of the characters. The sound of the game should be consistent with the style and color of the game, and be varied in different scenes or stages, so that the game’s worldview and the user’s perception are seamlessly integrated, reducing the user’s sense of alienation during the experience.</p>
<p>For example, in the fast-paced battle of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players tend to focus on the center of the screen and it is difficult to notice changes in edge UI elements, such as the countdown to skill cooldown. At this time, sound and sound effects can play a very good feedback role: clicking on a skill in cooldown can be informed that your skill is in cooldown through the feedback sound effect of the empty state; when the skill cooldown ends, there is also a corresponding sound effect reminder of skill recovery.</p>
<p>In addition, the various background music in the game, and even the design of UGC instrument composition music, will also bring players a new emotional experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fe039528a-3991-4ddf-8a69-1cf3a00c82d8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<p>The gameplay of musical instruments in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is also diverse, making good use of music to promote interaction and communication between players.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb4588e45-d0c7-4789-90e9-2a4039d02f8b.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Similarly, the “Crystal Prelude” of “Final Fantasy” is one of the most classic melodies in the history of games. The core melody of this prelude has become an important part of almost every “Final Fantasy”. The “Crystal Prelude” adapted by composer Masayoshi Soken for “Final Fantasy XIV” is a brisk melody that makes people look forward to the upcoming fantasy journey; while in “Final Fantasy XVI”, it uses dark music to foreshadow the suffering that Clive will endure, suggesting to players the dark and heavy plot experience on the auditory level.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F2d9b8746-bc10-44da-8aa0-d993a8f09627.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Touch evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, as part of visceral emotional design, touch can help improve the playability and fun of the game, making players more immersed in the game. The control in the game is the most direct way of contact between the player and the game. Through fine control feedback, players can feel the authenticity and tension in the game.</p>
<p>In the expression of touch, the greatest extent of tactile expression we can currently achieve is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller. For example, in the racing game <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the controller will simulate the vibration effect of car collisions and impacts, allowing players to feel the danger and tension of the car driving at high speed. In addition, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some heroes’ ultimate skills, successful parries, the second stage of bow charging, being hit by ground gas, and when the stamina is reduced to a red warning, will also trigger controller vibration.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience"><a href="#Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience"></a>Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience</h3><p>Enhancing the emotional connection between users and the game world through interaction can bring users a pleasant game experience at the behavioral level, thereby allowing users to further immerse themselves in it. Specifically, the immersive emotional experience at the behavioral level can enable users to more focusedly accept the information transmission in the game, cleverly stimulate users’ unconscious behaviors, and increase the playability of the game. In order to make the game more naturally guide the occurrence of user behavior at the behavioral level and complete the emotional communication between the game and the player, the technique of empathy can be used.</p>
<p>The so-called empathy is to use anthropomorphism, symbolism, metaphor and other methods to design the interface or emotional symbols in the game, give meaning to abstract UI controls, inject emotion into cold virtual graphics, connect the virtual world on the screen with the real world, and build psychological resonance through similar relationships, so that users can quickly adapt to the new context and integrate into the game atmosphere expected by the designer.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<hr>
<p><em>In “All-Star Streetball Party”, the card drawing is packaged as a “supply box”, which is in line with the game’s worldview and helps players understand and use it</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in the retro and avant-garde Internet world constructed in <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, the game designer replaced the hand under the first-person perspective in the game with a thumbs-up gesture or a mouse arrow. By metaphor, the space in the browser is turned into something similar to the physical world, showing the contradiction between the network world and the real world, and bringing players unexpected game experience at the behavioral level with the clever design of interaction.<br>&nbsp; </p>

Will Wright, the designer of “The Sims”, said: “Games can bring people different emotional experiences, which are the pride or guilt that they have never felt when watching movies.” From the perspective of interaction, in game experience design, by combining the above three game design elements, creating attractive experiences with clear strategies and skills can better improve the emotional experience of the game.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> does not have the clear task guidance of traditional RPG games, but players have an extremely immersive game experience. The reason is the clear exploration goals in the game. The game designs a multi-layered map system that is interconnected and independent of each other at the interaction level, so that the map expands the space for vertical exploration and is more exploratory; and, the guidance design that can be seen everywhere in the open world adds a spiral upward light vortex to the shrine, which is convenient for players to easily find even at high places. In the dark underground world, the shimmer of tree roots becomes the only visible beacon, hinting at various resources, landscapes, and enemies in the dark.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>For games, the difficulty setting of the game itself determines what kind of experience it can bring to players. If it is too simple, it will be boring, and if it is too complicated, it will make people feel anxious. The setting of the game should allow players to be in a challenging range in real time, and the skills required are also constantly improving. In addition to the aforementioned roguelike games and Soulslike games, the emergence of emergent interaction (涌现式交互 - yǒng xiàn shì jiāo hù) also gives the game new fun and challenges, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors, perfectly matching the players’ emotional needs for high freedom and high playability.</p>
<p>The excellent game experience of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> inherits the emergent interaction gene of the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> series, that is, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors. For example, in a certain dungeon, there is a chess game that requires the player to kill the black king within three steps. Even if the player does not understand the rules of chess at all, he will find that the black king is weak to electricity and can directly kill the king with electric spells. Like this, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> builds a world with infinite possibilities through the design of the underlying system rules. The integration of emergent interaction also greatly enhances the fun and spread of the game.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>For emotional experience, feedback is a stabilizer and amplifier, stabilizing uneasy emotions and amplifying pleasant feelings. The game system itself is a complex system. Players input their ideas and controls, and through the processing of the game mechanism, they give feedback to the players. Players get the feedback they want and the appropriate degree, and they are more likely to continue to be in pleasure.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Games are not only tools for entertainment and recreation, they also have the potential to evoke emotions and touch hearts, and through visceral sensory effects, empathy, game interaction mechanisms and storylines, etc., to trigger players’ emotional resonance and create a rich game experience. We have also made a more in-depth dismantling of the relationship between games and emotional design. With the continuous development of the game industry, emotional design will continue to play an important role in game experience, creating unforgettable emotional experiences for players.</p>

    <title>Text Overflow - The Old Problem of Game Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/09/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20231008_28584_1113543/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231008/28584_1113543.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Localization translation and interface adaptation are indispensable parts of the process of launching a game overseas. However, some troublesome problems are often encountered in this process. One of the most common problems is that many foreign language expressions are much longer in characters than the corresponding Chinese, causing the translated text to exceed the originally designed UI, icon, or text box, resulting in incomplete display.</p>
<p>This situation hinders players’ understanding, and at the same time greatly reduces the sense of quality of the game in the minds of overseas players, which has a negative impact on retention and reputation. Localization translators always hope to accurately reproduce the meaning of the original language and maintain the original flavor as much as possible, achieving faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance, but they often feel helpless because of the length of foreign language expressions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Length-Comparison-of-Different-Languages"><a href="#1-Length-Comparison-of-Different-Languages" class="headerlink" title="1. Length Comparison of Different Languages"></a>1. Length Comparison of Different Languages</h2><p>Languages of different countries have their own unique writing norms, and the same is true in the localization of games. When performing localization translation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the fields involved to ensure the accuracy of the translation and the integrity of the semantics.</p>
<p>However, different languages have a general ratio of words when translated. For example, the ratio of English translated into Chinese is 1:1.6, while the ratio of Japanese and Korean translated into Chinese is about 1:1. In contrast, the text of some minor European languages is much longer. The ratio of German and French translated into Chinese is 1:1.8, and the ratio of Russian, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Arabic translated into Chinese is as high as 1:2. The higher the word count ratio, the easier it is to cause the problem of translated text exceeding the box during the localization process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb430dff5-5c1c-479e-b84f-33700c328842.png/size/"></p>
<p>Taking <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which is handled by the localization team under NetEase Leihuo UX, as an example, we analyzed the number of characters in the foreign language text and the number of characters in the Chinese text of the game, and obtained the risk of text exceeding the box in different languages in the game, as shown in the figure below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F147aa651-7f19-40a7-87b1-1c2058316515.png/size/"></p>
<p>It can be seen that the risk of text exceeding the box in all 11 languages in the figure is greater than 50%. Japanese and Korean have about 60% probability of seeing the text window, while European minor languages are almost “completely wiped out”, becoming the hardest hit areas for exceeding the box, with a probability close to 80%. Therefore, it can be said that how to face and solve the problem of text exceeding the box during game localization is a “long-standing” problem faced by every language.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Reduce-the-Risk-of-Exceeding-the-Box"><a href="#2-How-to-Reduce-the-Risk-of-Exceeding-the-Box" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Reduce the Risk of Exceeding the Box?"></a>2. How to Reduce the Risk of Exceeding the Box?</h2><p>Although exceeding the box is a major problem that often occurs in the localization process of games, after years of exploration and experience accumulation, and in-depth exploration with technical team members, we can still find some potential methods to minimize the risk of exceeding the box of localized text in various languages, and even avoid this problem from the source as much as possible, so as to ensure the basic understanding and game experience of players in different countries and regions.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Development-Stage"><a href="#Game-Development-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Game Development Stage"></a>Game Development Stage</h3><p>• <strong>Prepare for multiple languages when designing text boxes in the UI</strong></p>
<p>If the game is intended to be released overseas at the beginning of its development, the UI team can comprehensively consider it in conjunction with the localization team at the beginning of the design. On the premise of ensuring interface design and interaction effects, the original text box can be appropriately expanded according to the length ratio of multiple languages to increase the text tolerance threshold of different languages.</p>
<p>• <strong>Design scrolling effects for text boxes</strong></p>
<p>Some Chinese expressions are very concise, using multiple compound sentences in just a few sentences, or having a strong classical Chinese nature (such as poems, ancient Chinese styles, etc.). Therefore, during the translation process, the number of characters in foreign languages may be 2-3 times longer than that of Chinese. In this case, when localizing game text, it is difficult for translators to significantly reduce the translation while retaining the original meaning. If the text box in the game is limited by the interface width and cannot be further expanded, you can consider making the text scroll to avoid the problem of exceeding the box.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to this approach. Scrolling text can theoretically play text of any length and has strong inclusiveness; at the same time, there is no need to adjust the font and font size of the text, and the length of the text box does not need to be expanded to the maximum extent that the interface can bear; players can generally obtain and understand the information that the game wants to provide from the scrolling text.</p>
<p>Of course, considering the current mainstream games at home and abroad, the design of scrolling text generally appears in the game in task names, equipment introductions, etc., and is not suitable for the problem of exceeding the box in all positions and content forms. Some of the reasons include that scrolling some text technically and programmatically will lead to reduced game performance and increased overhead, and when the text that requires context understanding is too long, it is easier to increase understanding barriers and reduce the reading experience.</p>
<p>• <strong>Give character length suggestions</strong></p>
<p>Compared with directly expanding the text box in UI design in the early stage of the project, giving text character length suggestions and finding the method of the longest character number can improve certain flexibility. Because this method can give more design space to UI and interaction, and at the same time, it can also minimize the risk of exceeding the box of the original Chinese (copywriting planners, system planners, etc. also know this character number suggestion) and localized translation.</p>
<p>However, there are two points to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The impact of resolution on text length:</strong> Text that has no problems may exceed the box and display incompletely after changing the resolution. Or, some fonts have been adjusted to the smallest font size, even if the adaptive (best fit, can adjust the font size or wrap) is turned on, the font size cannot be further reduced when the resolution is lowered.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F74b8e32c-f86d-4771-850c-7b7fdbe2af97.png/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, when the UI team gives suggestions on the length of text characters for text boxes, it is best to consider the various resolutions supported by the game in combination with the different platforms on which the game is launched.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>The impact of fonts:</strong> Even within the same language, different fonts will have a relatively obvious impact on the length of the displayed text. As shown below, the font of the first line of English is Arial, and the font of the second line of English is Times New Roman.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb5401acf-fb1a-4c76-8179-b6e18ecb82f9.png/size/"></p>
<p>It can be clearly seen that the length of the same text will be different if it is displayed in different fonts. Therefore, if only a character limit is given, such as 4 characters, the translator uses a different font from the developer when using excel or other translation software, the length of the translation is likely to be different from the standard character length given by the development team.</p>
<p>Let’s give another example: the developer set a maximum of 23 characters for a button in the game, and the font from the developer’s perspective is Times New Roman. The translator set the font to Arial when performing localization in the translation system. The translator translates the text in this button as:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;nbsp; 
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F390df84a-d821-4ebf-b9fa-892c4ce0d6f1.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>It can be seen that although the translator’s translation is exactly 23 characters, it still exceeds the box by one letter.</p>
<p>Even if the upstream and downstream departments unify the font, simply giving a character limit is still not necessarily the most recommended solution. Because different translators have different translation habits and commonly used words, the same sentence will have multiple translations. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buy this with gold</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With gold unlock it</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that the number of characters in both translations is 18, but the following sentence exceeds the box by one letter compared to the above sentence. This problem will be more obvious in longer compound sentences.</p>
<p>Therefore, the UI team can give character length suggestions based on “m, n”. For example, the length of a button is “mmmmmmn”. At this time, no matter what font or expression the translator uses, they only need to compare the length with “mmmmmmn” to determine whether there is a risk of exceeding the box.</p>
<h3 id="Localization-Translation-Stage"><a href="#Localization-Translation-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Localization Translation Stage"></a>Localization Translation Stage</h3><p>In addition to the early operation of reducing the risk of text exceeding the box during the development and design stage of the game, the translation during the localization process is also an important stage to ensure that the game interface finally presented to overseas players does not exceed the box.</p>
<p>• First of all, translators need to have enough understanding of the game content to be able to identify the possible location of the text during the translation stage and appropriately streamline the translation.</p>
<p>For example, “Unlock in time-limited event”, a new translator may translate it as “You can unlock this item by the time-limited event”; and a translator who knows the game well enough can immediately judge that this sentence is likely to appear in a certain prop, the unlocking method interface (button) of a certain item, usually a small text box, so it can be directly translated as “Unlock by time-limited event”.</p>
<p>• Use abbreviations instead of full spelling</p>
<p>This method is common in secondary interfaces or later in the game (players have a prior understanding of the full spelling), and can also reduce the risk of text exceeding the box with high efficiency. Common abbreviations include: damage-DMG; attack-ATK; experience-EXP, etc.</p>
<p>• Split sentences and reduce the use of conjunctions and prepositions during the localization process.</p>
<p>For example, the translation of the following sentence: 奧义状态下再造成100点伤害提升至第3级.</p>
<p>Dealing 100 damage by Hero’s Ultimate state and then raising to level 3.</p>
<p>Upgrade to Lv.3: Deal 100 more damage by Hero’s Ultimate</p>
<p>This translation divides the original complex expression into two sentences, avoiding the use of lengthy and difficult-to-understand compound sentences, which not only simplifies the translation, but also reduces the reading cost of players.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>The problem of exceeding the box during the game localization translation process may be common in games on different platforms. We also found that this is a common problem in various languages, which not only affects the playability of the game and player reputation, but may also further hinder the retention of the game. Based on the experience of previous projects, we propose some solutions, aiming to avoid the problem of text exceeding the box as much as possible during the development and localization process of the game.</p>
<p>First of all, we recommend that the localization issues be considered jointly by various functions at the game development stage, including UI, GUI, localization, planning, programming, etc. This means that the design of the game must take into account the differences between different languages and cultures from the beginning to ensure the playability and consistency of the game in different languages. Secondly, during the translation process, we recommend using professional translation software and tools to help identify and correct the problem of exceeding the box to ensure the accuracy and quality of the translation and improve the player experience.</p>
<p>In short, the problem of exceeding the box is one of the challenges that must be faced in game localization. By taking appropriate measures during the development and translation process of the game, these problems can be avoided to the greatest extent, and a better game experience can be provided for players around the world.</p>

    <title>Layered and Engaging Visual Hierarchy Design in 3D Lobbies</title>
    <url>/2023/10/08/netease-ux-articles/news_20231030_28584_1117528/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231030/28584_1117528.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The game lobby serves as a transportation hub in the game, mainly responsible for guiding players to different sub-functions and sub-systems (such as tasks, activities, social interactions, etc.) other than the core gameplay. In addition to the above tasks, it also includes displaying other information (such as various prompts), carrying some of the players’ social needs, and other additional functions. Therefore, the current display-type lobby format can no longer meet the needs of players in the lobby. The 3D interactive lobby format came into being. Players can familiarize themselves with and understand the game’s worldview, basic operations, and many other functions in the game in advance in this lobby space.</p>
<p>However, the visual hierarchy in a three-dimensional space is more complex than in a two-dimensional space. So, as game designers, how can we do a good job in the visual hierarchy design of information in the 3D lobby, provide players with a lobby experience that combines immersion and practicality, and achieve the “engaging” design effect? This article will start with the classification of game lobbies, and then introduce from the inside out from three aspects: “reasonable display of information according to priority”, “reasonable display or hiding of information”, and “visual packaging combined with worldview”.</p>
<h2 id="1-Classification-of-Game-Lobbies"><a href="#1-Classification-of-Game-Lobbies" class="headerlink" title="1. Classification of Game Lobbies"></a>1. Classification of Game Lobbies</h2><p>Currently, the more common game lobby design directions can be roughly divided into two types: display type and exploration type, and each type can be further subdivided into 2D and 3D according to the dimensions of the space. The fundamental difference between display and exploration types is whether the character controlled by the player can move freely in the scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F900f5d07-cad1-4d29-ae2c-d2370b506519.png/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2D-Display Type:</strong> A more general lobby type, commonly found in various mobile games. The design of the visual hierarchy of the interface also adopts a straightforward approach. The main purpose is to display functional entrances as much as possible in a limited space, and to facilitate players to enter various functions;</li>
<li><strong>3D-Display Type:</strong> Mainly displays character and scene models. The character models and scenes in this type of lobby choose the 3D form, which can show more model details, but the characters cannot be moved by the player in the space;</li>
<li><strong>2D-Exploration Type:</strong> Players can freely move on the horizontal axis, which is more similar to a horizontal scroll. In this type of lobby, more functional entrances are also bound to items in the scene;</li>
<li><strong>3D-Exploration Type:</strong> Compared with 2D scenes, 3D exploration type lobbies add depth. Players can control characters to walk freely in the space. In addition to binding functions to items in the scene, they can even meet other players in the scene, allowing players to have more physicalized communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Underlying-Foundation-Reasonable-Display-of-Information-According-to-Priority"><a href="#2-Underlying-Foundation-Reasonable-Display-of-Information-According-to-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2. Underlying Foundation: Reasonable Display of Information According to Priority"></a>2. Underlying Foundation: Reasonable Display of Information According to Priority</h2><p>The types of information carried in the game lobby are very diverse, including clickable buttons, functional entrance panels, and some instant information, such as messages from strangers and system tips. This information is very important to players, but displaying it without distinguishing priority will reduce the player’s experience and immersion, affecting information acquisition. Therefore, dividing the priority of information is also to more freely reduce the interference of some information and enhance the player’s sense of substitution in the game world.</p>
<h3 id="Important-Information-is-Always-Displayed-on-Top"><a href="#Important-Information-is-Always-Displayed-on-Top" class="headerlink" title="Important Information is Always Displayed on Top"></a>Important Information is Always Displayed on Top</h3><p>In the space of the 3D lobby, players will be attracted by various elements in the scene, and at the same time, there will be various system information that needs to be queued to inform the user. However, some highest priority information needs to be fed back to the player in time, such as the current status and location. In conventional design, the effect of such information will be enhanced, but doing so may directly conflict with the goal of “immersion”. Therefore, for this part of the information, it is necessary to display it on top in a fixed position in the space to cultivate the player’s habits.</p>
<p>According to the characteristics of this type of information, in most 3D lobby designs, they will be placed in the four corners of the screen, including 2 reasons:</p>
<p>(1). Information residing in the corners does not affect players’ exploration and substitution of space;<br>(2). For information in the corner, players can quickly locate it, and the line of sight or interactive tools (mouse) do not need to be specifically searched to move to the information area. This design is also in line with “Fitts’s Law”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F3f7ef8d0-b136-4ae4-92ca-d7f4df204548.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Give-Players-Necessary-Help-Information"><a href="#Give-Players-Necessary-Help-Information" class="headerlink" title="Give Players Necessary Help Information"></a>Give Players Necessary Help Information</h3><p>In the game, the role of the lobby function is more like a product. Therefore, when designing the information hierarchy of the 3D lobby, you can learn from some product interaction concepts, such as Nielsen’s ten usability principles of “Help and documentation”.</p>
<p>The Help and documentation principle means that it is best if the system allows users to use it without reading the documentation, but help documentation is usually still needed. Any information should be easy to search, focus on the user’s tasks, and list specific steps to inform the user.</p>
<p>In the 3D lobby space scene, players may be confused about how and where to open some functions. Therefore, some games use the form of resident HUD to help players understand the shortcut keys of some operations. For example, the 3D lobby mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> - Penglai Island provides shortcut key prompts for various shortcut operations.</p>
<p>The information of this nature is to help players better integrate into the operation of the game, so it will also be at the top of the information hierarchy, and the positioning in the plane will also refer to the location of important information, that is, at the edge of the screen and does not affect the player’s experience of the scene. </p>

Therefore, in the presentation of information, it is still necessary to maintain a certain degree of fun to stimulate players’ interest in exploring the 3D space. In the process of exploration, it can also increase players’ understanding of the worldview and game background, and discover the small easter eggs buried by the designers. However, when choosing this information, it is necessary to pay attention to that they will not affect the player’s main operations and main process, so as to avoid negative impact on the main process. </p>

Middle Layer Control: Reasonable “Display” or “Hiding” of Information</h2><p>Players move constantly in the 3D lobby, which causes their spatial position to change. For example, when a player is attracted to an item or scene, they will move. Therefore, the prompt information in the scene is also constantly moving relative to the character. In addition, as the distance increases, the information in the space will gradually disappear. Therefore, while considering the information hierarchy, it is also necessary to comprehensively consider the player’s wishes and the impact on immersion.</p>
<h3 id="Give-Players-the-Right-to-Choose"><a href="#Give-Players-the-Right-to-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Give Players the Right to Choose"></a>Give Players the Right to Choose</h3><p>When players are exposed to the new lobby design form of the 3D lobby, they naturally also hope to be able to explore the entire scene and its details. When they can generate the feeling that they have replaced the characters in it, they have largely mastered some basic game operations. At this time, some HUD information in the scene is not suitable for display. If players can choose to display or hide independently, it will be able to greatly enhance the player’s “environmental immersion”. This is also very much in line with the “User control and freedom” principle of the ten usability principles.</p>
<p>In <em>The Division 2</em>, players can turn off the HUD display in the settings to enhance the immersive experience of the game. </p>

The purpose is also to allow players to better invest in the game’s worldview and plot. This purpose coincides with the 3D lobby. The linear design style can better weaken the distraction of UI on players’ attention during the experience. In some designs, it will be used: when the player approaches, it will display and prompt the specific function, and when the player is still a certain distance away, it will only provide instructions to indicate that “there is a function that can be operated in this area”.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>The Division 2</em>, when the player approaches, the interface will prompt the function of the area and click to open the operation panel. In <em>Star Citizen</em>, the operation of the function is bound to the items in the scene. When the player is far away, only the prompt is seen, and when approaching, the specific function can be opened. </p>

<p>As for the scale of weakening information and how close the player is to pop up the prompt of the function, it depends on the game designer’s choice of scene and the map size of the 3D lobby. When the picture is at a wide angle, indicative information can be displayed when the player moves continuously for 3 units; when the picture is at close range, too much information will affect the player’s experience. However, these considerations also need to be determined according to the actual situation of the game.</p>

For these functions, it is more hoped that players can go to understand, and then promote players’ understanding of the game’s worldview and background. For example, in the decryption information in the lobby of <em>Identity V</em>, the visual intensity will be stronger than the light on the wall, which is also hoped to attract players’ attention in this way, and explore and discover secrets in this castle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fd61a2143-815b-4629-83c0-bdc22a6a0410.png/size/"></p>

<p>The “Cloud Top Racing” gameplay in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> Penglai Island is similar.

The designer strengthened the entrance of the game by marking the wooden sign of the “Cloud Top Racing” gameplay, and attracted the attention of players. </p>

Top-level Presentation: Visual Packaging Combined with Worldview"></a>4. Top-level Presentation: Visual Packaging Combined with Worldview</h2><p>A very important part of visual hierarchy design is how to make information appear in the player’s field of vision without being obtrusive, which requires better integration with the worldview. The most common example is that science fiction games usually have a helmet or monitor for the player’s character, and some information can be displayed on the player’s screen through the form of HUD, which can also bring a stronger sense of immersion.</p>
<h3 id="Display-Information-Based-on-Game-Background"><a href="#Display-Information-Based-on-Game-Background" class="headerlink" title="Display Information Based on Game Background"></a>Display Information Based on Game Background</h3><p>As visual animals, humans are easily affected by what their eyes see. When experiencing the game, the first thing we come into contact with is the visual design of the “game lobby”. If this design can be closely integrated with the game’s worldview, it can bring players a better environmental sensory experience.</p>
<p>And the creation of the environment is not only the work of art designers and scene designers, but as interaction designers, they also need to better integrate information with the scene, and need to distinguish between functional entrances and ordinary embellishment entrances; at the same time, they can allow players to view some important information at any time, avoiding being immersed in the environment and losing curiosity about the core gameplay. For example, in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, designers display the displayed information through graffiti, and make a short stay for the information of other players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc064b948-f66d-4a8a-b6cf-7a0c23af5eab.png/size/"></p>

Designers can consider doing more scenario design in this scene. While ensuring the display of basic information, designers had better leave more space for the display of environment and scenes, and will change the background according to the changes of marketing activities. On this basis, some information can be placed in the scene, such as the name of the place, instructions for secondary operations, and so on. The purpose of doing so is also to help players in the process of exploring the lobby, gradually generate the idea of “I am the character”.</p>
<p>For example, the entrance to the battle in <em>Splatoon 3</em> is placed in a building, and players can enter the battle mode selection by entering the building; also in this game, the newly launched function “locker”, players can customize their own lockers in a personalized way, and have more communication and interaction with other players. </p>

<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Today, the design of 3D lobbies is becoming more and more abundant. Designers have added more new gameplay to the scene and space to ensure that players will not feel bored and uninteresting in the lobby. These innovations and optimizations aim to make players more immersive in the game world while gaining more fun. At the same time, the information in the scene is also becoming more and more, and the information density is also getting higher and higher. Therefore, designers need to carefully and rigorously design the visual hierarchy of information to enhance the player’s sense of substitution, environmental sensory experience and immersion in the game.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231030/28584_1117531.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-Context"><a href="#1-Context" class="headerlink" title="1. Context"></a>1. Context</h2><h3 id="What-is-context"><a href="#What-is-context" class="headerlink" title="What is context?"></a>What is context?</h3><p>Context refers to the environment when using language. Context can usually be divided into two types: narrow and broad. Narrowly defined, it refers to the linguistic environment formed by the context of written language or the preceding and following words of spoken language; broadly defined, it refers to the specific environment of language expression (which can refer to specific occasions or social environment).</p>
<p>In addition to the objective environment, context is also related to the background knowledge in the minds of each user and expresser.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-recontextualization"><a href="#What-is-recontextualization" class="headerlink" title="What is recontextualization?"></a>What is recontextualization?</h3><p>“Recontextualization” is a sociolinguistic concept summarized by Per Linell, which refers to extracting a piece of discourse from its original context and placing it in a new context, and this new context may change the meaning and understanding of the discourse. This method is often used in various media and contexts such as news reports, political discourse, and advertising. In the words of the German poet Novalis, the role of recontextualization is to “make the familiar strange and the strange familiar”.</p>
<p>For example, “killing the chicken to get the eggs” originally meant to literally kill the chicken in order to get the eggs; it is a metaphor for coveting immediate benefits without considering long-term interests. In “Let the Bullets Fly”, the “killing the chicken to get the eggs” in Master Huang’s context refers to getting rid of Zhang Mazi and taking back the diamonds.</p>
<p>For another example, the “original display” we see when visiting a museum is a “recontextualization” of the excavated&#x2F;preserved cultural relics: giving new value to the cultural relics in a new time and space. Visitors re-experience the era background of the cultural relics and their possible functions and meanings through the museum’s layout and curation. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Context"><a href="#Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Design Context"></a>Design Context</h3><p>The design context refers to the environment, background, and cultural factors of the design work, as well as the interaction between the design work and the surrounding environment, users, and society. The design context determines the actual effect and meaning of the design work.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly used household chopstick holder is designed with many openings for ventilation to prevent the chopsticks from being closed, damp, and deteriorating. This design in the outdoor context allows it to be used as a firewood stove. The porous structure cleverly ensures sufficient oxygen conditions for starting a fire. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc3f38481-4b60-420e-88d3-6466e44d109b.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Game-Experience-Design-Context"><a href="#Game-Experience-Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Game Experience Design Context"></a>Game Experience Design Context</h3><p>The game’s worldview is a complex that encompasses architecture, space, scenes, art style, economy, system, and social customs. It encompasses the physical environment, cultural environment, and social environment in the design context, affecting the visual effects, cultural meanings, and values of the design content.</p>
<p>The interaction between the game and the player means that the game and the player are symbionts under the same worldview. Factors such as the player’s game goals and needs, usage habits, operating behaviors, and psychological state during use are as important as the worldview in affecting the use effect and user satisfaction of the design content. For example, in “Minecraft”, the large amount of real-world UGC content created by players continues to inject new vitality into the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F309d8dfb-9f23-4c82-a6f1-db3de71aa1f2.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p>Therefore, in game experience design, considering the context is very important, it can help developers better understand the usage scenarios and needs of functions, so as to better meet user needs and improve player satisfaction. At the same time, considering the context can also help developers create design works with more cultural connotations and social value, and improve the artistry and innovation of design works.</p>
<h2 id="2-Recontextualization-in-Games"><a href="#2-Recontextualization-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Recontextualization in Games"></a>2. Recontextualization in Games</h2><p>Recontextualization in games refers to the game introducing new mechanisms or informing new information, so that players can (voluntarily) experience existing content in a new way, that is, a way to revitalize existing content. Common application methods in games include the following two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing familiar environments and content by using new mechanisms or props.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing existing content from different angles&#x2F;paths through the transfer of prior knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent example of recontextualization in game design is <em>Hitman 2</em>, where developers, through the design of “identity roles” and their “scope of activities” and “mission objectives”, allow players to have multiple “recontextualization” experiences, and even bring a “lingering” game experience.</p>
<p>In this game, players can eliminate NPCs of different class identities and clothing to disguise themselves as characters with different identity permissions, and then enter different areas of the map with different open levels. The single game map and the number of NPCs are fixed. In order to complete various challenges on the same map, players need to repeatedly explore and replay between different roles and areas using existing knowledge to achieve all challenge goals. At the same time, with the different identity roles of the player, the tasks that the current role needs to complete, the dangers in the scene, and the boundary prompts will also change. </p>

How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design"></a>3. How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design</h2><p>From a macro perspective, the game itself is a way to “recontextualize” the content it carries. Overall, there is only one core idea: “As long as I want to do it and I can do it, then I can do it”. But how to let players achieve this excellent experience of “thinking what I think, doing what I can” in experience design?</p>
<p>In the following content, we combine the experience design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Penglai Island Cloud Top Race to further explain how to use the design idea of recontextualization in the game:</p>
<p>Penglai Island is a three-dimensional social environment launched by <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in its 2nd anniversary version, and Cloud Top Race is a section of architectural and stone ruins located in the southern part of Silver阙 Garden. Players can enter this area from the south of Silver阙 Garden. When players pass through this area within 360 seconds and reach the race finish line on the west side of Secret Source Island, they can get certain race rewards. </p>

If possible, without interfering with other content and enriching the function, multiple entry or exit experience paths can be set for the same content to meet most of the possibilities of player exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F64b490a4-b51c-49de-8210-34e216bf5ebe.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Cloud Top Race game rules</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When designing the Cloud Top Race function of Penglai Island, it was not stipulated how players would reach the finish line, or what tools they would use. Only the most commonly used fast displacement prop in the game, [Grappling Hook], was triggered to increase the time. This can be regarded as a method reminder for reaching the finish line. In the actual experience process, players can follow the game’s teaching of jumping, grappling hook, wall strike, or even various combinations to reach the finish line in the fastest way, and they are all allowed.</p>
<h3 id="Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality"><a href="#Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Find Experience Mappings in Reality"></a>Find Experience Mappings in Reality</h3><p>In addition to simulating various behaviors that players may have, it is also necessary to further consider the source of gameplay and functions. Whether there are similar experience contents in reality. Sort out the experience processes of the two and correspond them one by one, reduce the keyboard and mouse interaction links in the design, and make the entire experience process more natural.</p>
<p>When designing the interaction between the start and finish lines of Cloud Top Race, the design team did not use the common general mechanism interaction in the game (ie, press [E]), but made a regional interaction behavior trigger logic, which can be very clearly found on it analogous to the experience process of most sports competitions in reality: players can start racing from entering the game area, start timing after crossing the “start line”, and stop timing and get rewards when reaching the finish line “crossing the line”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F4147d0e3-3027-4222-a983-40fb3bee9903.png/size/"></p>

That is, on the premise of ensuring the fairness of the game content, adjust the low emotional feedback nodes in the real experience, avoid excessive frustration, and keep the player’s emotions on the basic emotional baseline of the game during the experience.</p>
<p>In the race, the player’s use of the grappling hook prop itself can be regarded as a way to quickly move and reduce the fair racing experience, but the designer did not impose an “irreversible penalty” on the player, such as canceling the result in sports competitions, but used the analogy between movement distance and grappling hook, and used increasing timing to complete the basic punishment method for the player. Moreover, in many players’ racing processes, using the grappling hook when accidentally making a mistake in the middle of the race can also be used as an effective strategy to “avoid restarting”. Many skilled players can complete the entire race within 50 seconds even with a single use of the grappling hook. </p>

<p>At the same time, in order to avoid the player’s emotional depression during the race, the target point prompt will be refreshed in time within a certain range during the race to help the player find the official racing track direction and avoid the player’s emotional low tide caused by direction loss; basic reward props are set for players with different racing durations to ensure the basic acquisition experience of players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F3ebdd198-99f7-454c-a150-4b12e36f2952.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p>After familiarizing yourself with “recontextualization” and this design idea, we can see that in addition to the large gameplay that can perfectly fit its design process, many small design details in the game also hide the ingenuity of “recontextualization”. For example, in the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> maps of Griffin’s Nest and Fire Nation, a large number of small animals that conform to the characteristics of the scene and season can obtain prop rewards after being killed, and shooting down the Spring Festival targets flying in the air will also drop different rewards. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Considerations"><a href="#Design-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Design Considerations"></a>Design Considerations</h3><p>The application of “recontextualization” in experience design can be regarded as a design method that can move the game four or two: it can expand the scope and possibilities of the game to infinity through limited content. However, due to the limitations of recontextualization design, this effect will only have a significant positive feedback effect in “non-linear” or “multi-map” games (that is, players do not need to complete the single-process game content according to a single timeline), such as the association design of A-side and B-side in Celeste, allowing players to enter the original level multiple times to experience new content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc5ed75e1-ac6f-47cf-bd7a-97e9278ecb69.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Celeste》 The player accidentally learned the charged super jump in the A-side content</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the same time, these “recontextualized” contents basically use more complex scene design and level connections in order to “create enough possibilities”, and often require more cost and time to develop. Some content details may not be discovered by players until the game disappears from the market.</p>
<p>As <em>The Stanley Parable</em> developer Pugh said, “The production of these contents is like shouting at the void. It may take two years before you can hear the echo from the other end of the void, because someone finally heard your silent shout from the cacophony.” However, it is precisely because these game designers continue to scrutinize and sculpt works of art that we can glimpse their state of mind at that time across time and space during the experience, and complete a spiritual adventure. </p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When we were children, we ran around downstairs at home, which constituted our first impression of the outside road. But when you learn to ride a bicycle, skateboard, or even drive, roads of different materials and widths have unique meanings in your eyes. From the first time you play games with a keyboard and mouse to later contacting different platforms and devices, the same game also produces new experiences in your eyes.</p>
<p>The powerful positive feedback brought by recontextualization design is essentially based on the player’s desire for learning and exploration and discovery, and the source of its happiness is the player’s original intention of being curious about the world. Please stay curious and continue to explore this world. Perhaps behind many of the contents you find with surprise, there is a carnival in the heart of a designer.</p>

    <title>Games Have Backups Too - Why Do We Need Secondary Games</title>
    <url>/2023/12/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20240105_28584_1130221/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240105/28584_1130221.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games"><a href="#1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?"></a>1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?</h2><p>The concept of “main game, secondary game” has been around for quite some time, mainly because the content design of some games on the market greatly reduces the burden on players, allowing them to experience the game content flexibly, saving them worry and effort.</p>
<p>In this way, players who like to watch live broadcasts will also find that many game streamers open some casual games (such as <em>Dou Dizhu</em>) while waiting for matchmaking. On the one hand, the matchmaking waiting time is indeed too long, and they can’t just wait. On the other hand, it can also add some effect to the live broadcast and interact with fans. This is not a phenomenon unique to live broadcast rooms. Many players will also play a round of <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> while resting after playing <em>DOTA</em>.</p>
<p>Many players will play multiple games at the same time, and the concept of “main game” and “secondary game” has gradually become popular. Sometimes it’s even “a solid secondary game, a flowing main game”. Main games and secondary games may not be specifically distinguished at the beginning, but are divided according to the time and energy invested. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, the game is large and there is a lot of content to explore; and as the player’s level increases and gradually unlocks guilds, homes, etc., a sense of belonging will gradually develop. Over time, while playing other games, they will also subconsciously set aside a certain amount of time for this game; while in comparison, secondary games focus more on the immediate feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240105%2Fe996d236-94a1-403b-98ca-4d581970a80e.gif/size/"></p>
<p>So, are all “lightweight games” “secondary games”?</p>
<p>Obviously not. The so-called main and secondary games have nothing to do with the game category itself, but are a relative concept. For each player, they can have their own “main game” and “secondary game”. Generally speaking, secondary games often have the following relative characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less time spent:</strong> On average, players spend less time and energy in this game than in other main games they play.</li>
<li><strong>Less economic expenditure:</strong> For most players, the investment of money is often proportional to the love of the game. This is also true for buyout games. Players are willing to pay for better-made games, and they are also willing to collect different versions of games for their feelings, even if this requires repeated expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Less emotional investment:</strong> Players of many games will spontaneously become “volunteers” for their favorite games, giving good reviews, promoting, and vigorously promoting the game. Those who are capable will also “generate electricity with love” and create more derivative products related to the game. However, players generally do not invest in this level of effort for secondary games.</li>
<li><strong>More single game goal:</strong> Secondary games often only meet a part of the player’s most core game experience needs, rather than meeting multiple needs at once.</li>
<li><strong>Weaker social connections:</strong> Except for some secondary games that are only experienced for social reasons, most players invest less time, energy, and emotion in experiencing secondary games, and hardly establish complex social relationships outside of experiencing the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?"></a>2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous section, secondary games often meet a certain part of the player’s game experience needs. Conversely, games that can simultaneously meet multiple core game experiences of players are more likely to become the main games that players invest in for a long time. This is also the fundamental reason why many games continue to expand gameplay, polish game content, and improve game experience: to attract and retain more players.</p>
<p>In the realm of philosophy, it is mentioned that in the process of things developing, the principal contradiction is in a dominant position, regulating or influencing other contradictions. As for game selection, when players find that one of their needs can be better matched with a certain game, they may choose to experience a secondary game.</p>
<p>For example, after a player experiences an extremely intense ranked match, “rest and relaxation” becomes their most urgent need; when waiting in line and not knowing when they will be called, what the player needs is a game that “starts and plays immediately, and will not be penalized for quitting”; on a train shuttling between mountains, “not afraid of lag” is the player’s most basic appeal; at a multiplayer offline party, friends enthusiastically invite, even if they don’t like this type of game, they will be willing to play with friends… At different times, players choose secondary games with different standards, but they are all closely related to the current needs. When these restrictions are no longer present, players will still return to their main game, because they have invested more energy here and can get more of the game experience they need.</p>
<p>This also causes the player’s main and secondary games to change or even switch over time. Students have more entertainment time and can spend more time completing daily tasks, “replacing krypton with liver”; and after entering the working state, time becomes precious, and they need to “spend money to buy time”.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More"><a href="#3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?"></a>3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?</h2><p>The market for secondary games is pioneering. Everyone’s time and energy are limited, and it is unrealistic to try to make players experience multiple main games at the same time. Although secondary games mean that players invest less, but many small amounts add up. Many games have gained a good reputation for their excellent quality and precise user insights. For example, <em>Tabi Kaeru (Travel Frog)</em>, launched in 2017, made many players keen to “raise a frog son”, and ranked first on the App Store China free game list without an official Chinese version. In many cases, the competitors of secondary games are not only other games, but also all things that will attract users’ attention. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240105%2Fc67f4b54-4202-45b4-9b5e-4426b067f2bb.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>How to make players more willing to experience a secondary game? We can learn a thing or two from the design of many hyper-casual games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to learn, simple to operate:</strong> A low game entry threshold can help the game be accessed and mastered by a wider range of players. Common gameplays of hyper-casual games such as puzzles, synthesis, stacking, racing, etc., players can almost learn at a glance and master the core gameplay in a short time. The operating frequency in the game is not high, the requirements for the player’s instantaneous response are low, or automatic pathfinding, automatic combat, and other methods are used;</li>
<li><strong>Small levels, short process:</strong> During the game process, players are not required to have high concentration and do not need to keep staring at the screen. Make full use of fragmented time, players can open the game anytime, anywhere, and there is no strict end time point, and the experience of entering and leaving is relatively smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Simple numerical design:</strong> The in-game cycle is relatively direct, and the acquisition and consumption paths of currency&#x2F;props are clear. However, simple values do not necessarily mean that the game has no depth and is abandoned after 1 hour. Through algorithms, many games can automatically generate hundreds of levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are some experiences that can provide inspiration for our design of secondary games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance to the main game:</strong> <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> uses the worldview, races, heroes, skills, and equipment system settings of <em>DOTA</em>, so that DOTA players can naturally get started with the game quickly and are more willing to stay in it, which plays a good supplementary role with some players’ main game <em>DOTA</em>;</li>
<li><strong>Reduced burden of daily tasks:</strong> There is no need for complicated login and task systems to tie up players’ time. Players can take some time to experience the game content for a period of time at one time, and it is not mandatory to go online every day or every hour;</li>
<li><strong>More compensation rewards, less penalty mechanisms:</strong> Even if the player is not online, they can still get growth in the game, such as offline rewards, experience compensation, etc.; and even if the player quits halfway, there will be no direct punishment, and there is no psychological burden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Lowering the quality because it is positioned as a secondary game? This is not acceptable to players and the market, and becoming a “secondary game” is not an excuse for game manufacturers to slack off. Letting players “meet major needs with low investment” is the standard of a successful secondary game, even if the player only stays in this game for a few hours, has watched the plot once and cleared the level, or has experienced the first 30 levels. I hope that when players look back and think of this game, they will praise it: “At that time, it was very interesting”.</p>

    <title>Free if You Don&#39;t Buy: Analyzing Popular Games that Went Free-to-Play</title>
    <url>/2024/01/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20240116_28584_1132308/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240116/28584_1132308.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models"><a href="#1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models" class="headerlink" title="1. Mainstream Game Payment Models"></a>1. Mainstream Game Payment Models</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “Buy early, enjoy early; buy late, enjoy discounts; don’t buy, get it for free.” After a game’s initial priced release, there’s usually a relatively long period of price stability, which is the main source of revenue for new games in their early stages. After a period of stable operation, there might be limited-time discounts at certain points, such as during Steam sales, to attract hesitant players.</p>
<p>And for some games, the final stage is to completely remove the payment barrier after a long period of operation and switch to free-to-play. <em>PUBG</em>, released in 2017 with an initial price of $29.99 (98 yuan in China), became a free-to-play game in January 2022. <em>Fall Guys</em>, released in August 2020 with an initial price of $19.99 (58 yuan in China), became free-to-play in June 2022. <em>Overwatch</em> went free-to-play when its sequel, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, was released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F74c69f71-14dc-4e51-a38e-dfdd95bb18b3.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>In summary, whether in China or abroad, there are mainly three payment models for online games: The first is buy-to-play, where you pay to purchase the experience qualification and obtain permanent access to the game after payment; examples include <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>New World</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p>
<p>The second is free-to-play, where there is no barrier to entry, replaced mainly by in-game store purchases. Examples include <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<p>The third is a time-based subscription model, where players purchase points to exchange for game time, paying for how much they play. Examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>. This payment model will not be discussed in this article.</p>
<p>So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these different payment models? Why do some developers choose to switch from paid to free, and what issues do game companies need to face when making this decision?</p>
<h3 id="Buy-to-Play-Games"><a href="#Buy-to-Play-Games" class="headerlink" title="Buy-to-Play Games"></a>Buy-to-Play Games</h3><p>For buy-to-play games, the main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game quality is usually relatively higher:</strong> Generally speaking, with similar investment budgets, the quality of buy-to-play games is relatively higher than that of free games. They need to attract players to overcome the payment barrier and try the game with quality. If the manufacturer does not have excellent graphics and core gameplay, it will be difficult to obtain sufficient revenue and reputation from selling the game. Compared with free games that profit from in-game stores, buy-to-play games save a lot of development and design resources on payment and long-term content. Therefore, they have enough manpower and resources to invest in game quality, concentrate on targeted design, and provide players with a better gaming experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Has a certain threshold, fewer cheaters:</strong> For players who use illegal software, they need to pay for the game again for each account they change. Increasing the cost of cheating for players by buying out also has a certain inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cheating to a certain extent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, sometimes the threshold limit is also one of its shortcomings. The mode of paying to purchase an admission ticket will also prevent some players from entering the game, especially since most AAA games are not cheap at the time of their initial release, which will become a factor hindering players from purchasing the game for players with different consumption levels.</p>
<h3 id="Free-Games"><a href="#Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="Free Games"></a>Free Games</h3><p>For free games, the biggest advantage is that there is no threshold. As long as the device can handle it, anyone can enter the game and experience it. Although everyone has different game preferences, and many players will find that they are not the target audience and lose interest in the game after trying it out, due to the large base of new players, the number of players who finally stay in the game may be more than that of some buy-to-play games.</p>
<p>Why do companies like Bluehole, Valve, and Activision Blizzard choose to make originally paid games free? From the data point of view, when making such a decision, the game is likely to have gone downhill for a while, and the number of retained players continues to decrease. Switching to free-to-play is also largely to attract more players who are kept out by the payment barrier. <em>PUBG</em>, a once-phenomenal game, has seen its DAU continue to decline since it reached its online peak in 2018 due to various reasons. By the end of 2021, the average number of online players in the game had fallen below 150,000, and the peak online was only about one-tenth of the peak. After announcing the switch to free-to-play, many free players poured in, the peak number of online players in the game almost doubled, and the average number of online players also increased significantly. <em>Fall Guys</em>, also a game that requires a high number of concurrent players, had very strong data in the early days of its launch, but as its popularity gradually declined, its developers were also considering how to extend the life of the game. After its decision to switch to free-to-play, the total number of players worldwide quickly exceeded 20 million, and exceeded 50 million within 2 weeks, further achieving a large-scale breakthrough in the user base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F1178cc1e-4db0-4bb3-83ae-53407235ef44.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-What-Issues-Should-Be-Paid-Attention-to-When-a-Game-Goes-Free-to-Play"><a href="#2-What-Issues-Should-Be-Paid-Attention-to-When-a-Game-Goes-Free-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="2. What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?"></a>2. What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?</h2><p>Although the effect is good, going free-to-play is not a tool that a game can casually use to attract players. If the following problems are not properly handled, it may have the opposite effect.</p>
<h3 id="Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place"><a href="#Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place" class="headerlink" title="Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place"></a>Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place</h3><p>Players who purchased the game before it went free-to-play are people who spent real money to buy the game and experience it. For developers, this part of the players needs more attention and maintenance. Game manufacturers cannot only focus on attracting new players and not do their best to retain existing veteran players. If the compensation given by the manufacturer to veteran players is sincere and attractive enough, it will also attract a large number of veteran players to return; if the compensation is stingy, veteran players will not only not buy it, but may also give the game a bad review because they feel betrayed, ruining the reputation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F412e1adb-2fb1-49b1-ba99-a54384d27d89.png/size/"></p>
<p>In this regard, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> directly returned the money spent by veteran players to purchase the game in equal proportion as in-game currency when it went free-to-play, so that everyone said “misunderstanding resolved” after learning about the compensation benefits, and called it a great deal; there were even many new players who directly purchased the game at the original price after seeing the news, and then waited for the refund of gold ingots. On the day of the free-to-play launch, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> sold another 1 million copies, once again climbing to the second place on the Steam sales list, and even the official website was overloaded by enthusiastic players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F0056ed33-b932-4a11-aad9-ec698ce79f68.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Live broadcast of Naraka: Bladepoint announcing free-to-play (left) and announcing compensation rewards for veteran players (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Anti-Cheat-Work"><a href="#Anti-Cheat-Work" class="headerlink" title="Anti-Cheat Work"></a>Anti-Cheat Work</h3><p>When a game becomes free, it means that there is no payment barrier for anyone to enter the game, and the soil of low account cost is particularly prone to breeding cheating and forming a proliferation. In a fair competitive environment, it is devastating to the game experience of normal players. When criminals can cheat at almost no cost, the gaming experience of normal players will be greatly affected. Especially for tactical competitive games, one cheating player will affect nearly 60 or even 100 normal players in the same game. One-shot headshots and ignoring control make the game experience very bad.</p>
<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>PUBG</em> has been criticized by players for cheating. After going free-to-play, it did not make effective restrictions on cheating. It only launched casual mode and competitive mode to separate paid players and free players when it switched to free. However, not all players are keen on competitive mode. In a mode where cheating is rampant and cannot be banned for a long time, any type of player will have a hard time having a good gaming experience.</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>, which also became a free-to-play game in 2022, has also been plagued by cheating, and is jokingly called “Fairy Bean Man” by players. The gameplay of <em>Fall Guys</em> is a casual level-breaking type, and the number of players in a single game is also large. One person cheating can make all players in this game restart directly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F245c9958-0b14-4b84-b33d-679fda77fe62.png/size/"></p>
<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also realized that once the game is open for free play, a large number of players will flood in, including criminals who intend to cheat. To this end, the development team made preparations in advance and banned 2,754 players who used cheats on the day of the free-to-play launch; at the same time, they also deducted the rank points of 163 players who “rode the cheat car” to warn all new and old players not to try to benefit from cheating, and to maintain a fair game environment in a timely manner.</p>
<h3 id="New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues"><a href="#New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues" class="headerlink" title="New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues"></a>New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues</h3><p>For new players, getting started with an old game that has been in operation for a period of time has a high cost. Veteran players have gone through a lot of training and have mastered many game skills, but new players don’t know anything when they enter the game, which can easily bring them some uncontrollable frustration. After the game goes free-to-play, on the one hand, the game needs to optimize the novice guide, teaching and other onboarding issues to lead new players to quickly master the game. Especially for some new players who have not necessarily been familiar with action games before, this group of non-core players and general players especially need strong novice guidance to teach and retain them. On the other hand, the game also needs to make more optimizations in the matching mechanism, reasonably allocate the rank difference of players in the game, and prevent the “smurfing” behavior of veteran players from leading to the direct churn of new players.</p>
<p>Novice guidance has always been a very important module of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. When it went free-to-play, the game deliberately added a lot of special training in the practice mode, including basic parry practice, charged attack followed by parry practice, jump parry practice, and higher-level operations such as dodge parry and grapple parry. Many of these operations require players to accumulate a certain amount of game time and number of games, and they can only be mastered skillfully after learning in actual combat. Putting them in the practice mode can facilitate players who are not familiar with action operations to carry out more practical exercises, accelerate the learning efficiency, and experience the joy of parrying faster. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2Fc735b95f-c1a2-4995-8f8a-bdb49ae7b4ab.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint’s new novice special training module</em></p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Going free-to-play is not a panacea for a game to revive when its popularity declines. If the decision to go free-to-play and the compensation plan are not fully considered, it may backfire and accelerate the decline of the game. Going free-to-play needs to carefully consider the different needs of new and old players, and ensure the game experience of all types of players, so that the game can have more players to play when it goes free-to-play, and the environment in the game can develop in a more balanced and healthy direction.</p>

    <title>Unveiling the Design Behind Horror Game Jumpscares and Players&#39; Cognitive Load</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167378.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>Horror works often use jumpscares as one of the basic building blocks of horror. This technique uses sudden scene changes and sound effects to make the player or audience “jump.”</p>
<p>Christopher Robert Cargill, screenwriter for the <em>Sinister</em> film series, explained the principle of jumpscares: “Jumpscares work because there’s misdirection. A successful jumpscare is like a magic trick. I’ll make you look over here, and I’ll do something over there, and then suddenly—bang!—something will scare you.”</p>
<p>As early as the 1976 film <em>Carrie</em>, the jumpscare at the end made the audience shudder: when the audience thought everything was over and saw Sue peacefully visiting Carrie’s grave with flowers, they would be scared by the hand that suddenly came out of the grave. </p>

<p>Similar jumpscare designs are also common in game scenes. In horror games, players usually perform a distracting task, such as finding items or solving puzzles, and the jumpscare will come at this unsuspecting moment. In the game <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, released in 2021, you can see players being startled by zombies that suddenly appear with the music while exploring. </p>

<p>At the end of 2023, a horror game <em>Lethal Company</em> exploded among game streamers, winning the Steam “Better With Friends” award of the year, and the highest daily views on Twitch reached 190,000. Kelsey Raynor, an editor at VG247, pointed out, “…although the blocky graphics may make the game seem incomparable to other horror masterpieces, <em>Lethal Company</em> still fascinates a large number of fans, and its weird aesthetics is obviously part of the game’s charm.” Gabriel Moss, an editor at IGN, also mentioned, “ <em>Lethal Company</em> is already a sensory miracle in a sense.” The success of <em>Lethal Company</em> is also due to jumpscares. In Twitch live broadcasts, you can often see streamers being scared by spiders that appear from nowhere while doing tasks. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we can also see players use the scene to artificially create some “jumpscares” to bring extra game fun: the Tianhai master hidden in the grass gives the unsuspecting Kurumi a little “surprise”. </p>

<h2 id="I-Research-on-the-Relationship-Between-Jumpscares-and-Cognitive-Load"><a href="#I-Research-on-the-Relationship-Between-Jumpscares-and-Cognitive-Load" class="headerlink" title="I. Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load"></a>I. Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load</h2><p>Generally speaking, the purpose of horror games is to allow players to experience thrills, and jumpscares achieve this by putting players in a state of physiological arousal: usually under the stimulation of jumpscares, players will experience increased heart rate, sweating, blinking, and heavier breathing. These physiological arousal responses are actually our body ensuring our safety when potential high-risk stimuli (such as gunshots) appear. For example, an increased heart rate is actually to improve our motor ability to avoid danger; blinking is to protect our vital visual organs; and sweating and heavier breathing are side effects of the sympathetic nervous system being upregulated.</p>
<p>One of the key factors influencing physiological arousal is cognitive load. Cognitive load refers to the proportion of the human brain’s information processing system that is occupied. The heavier the cognitive load, the less energy we have left to use.</p>
<p>Based on the influence of cognitive load on physiological arousal, researchers Thomas Terkildsen, Lene Engelst, and Mathias Clasen from Aarhus University in Denmark proposed the hypothesis that “cognitive load is also related to the final effect of jumpscares” and conducted a systematic study on this hypothesis. The researchers decided to simulate different levels of cognitive load through four memory training sessions of different difficulty levels, and to determine whether physiological arousal and psychological arousal were brought out by jumpscares by measuring electrodermal activity graphs and having players self-report their psychological responses.</p>
<h3 id="Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity"><a href="#Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity"></a>Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity</h3><p>In order to give the experiment participants an immersive experience, the researchers developed a high-fidelity graphic horror game using the Unity game engine. The researchers believe that developing a new game is necessary because this can ensure that the tasks used later to simulate different levels of cognitive load can be seamlessly integrated into the game and its narrative to maximize the realism of the research.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the player wakes up from a nightmare in a small, dimly lit room. With a loud knock on the metal door, a guard appears and tells the player that it is time for the test. The player is taken out of the room and along a long corridor with cells on both sides. The guard leading the way drags another guard out of the cell, covered in wounds and blood. Eventually, the player reaches the room next to the cell where the injured guard was seen. The layout of the entire room was inspired by a similar scene in the popular horror game <em>A Chair in a Room</em> by Wolf &amp; Wood. There is a blank Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)* on the table in the room, next to a small plastic container containing two pills. A doctor behind the glass window instructs the player through the intercom to take the pills and sit in the chair in the middle of the room to start the test. The projector on the wall starts to work… </p>

<p>* The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed by Professor Nasreddine in 2004 and is a rapid screening assessment tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The cognitive domains assessed include attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstract thinking, and calculation and orientation. The time it takes for a therapist to complete the MoCA assessment is approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load"><a href="#Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load" class="headerlink" title="Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load"></a>Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load</h3><p>After guiding the player to the task through the game, the researchers set up four cognitive load intensity environments for 60 players: zero cognitive load, low cognitive load, medium cognitive load, and high cognitive load. During the test, a series of different patterns will be shown to the players, and the players need to remember the position of the blue squares in the patterns. The rounds in which the blue squares to be memorized appear are incremented according to the cognitive load intensity group.</p>
<p>As the task progresses and the intensity increases, the distance between the patterns that the player needs to remember and the current time increases, the difficulty of memory gradually increases, and the player’s cognitive load also gradually increases. The jumpscare suddenly appears in this task: a grinning monster will yell and interrupt the current memory task, rushing to the player. </p>

<h3 id="Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results"><a href="#Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results" class="headerlink" title="Measurement Tools and Experimental Results"></a>Measurement Tools and Experimental Results</h3><p>In this experiment, the researchers mainly measured the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player’s self-reported psychological arousal:</strong> Measured using the Self-Assessment Manikin, a graphic-based questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective physiological arousal:</strong> Measured by electrodermal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Player’s subjective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured using the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured by the performance of completing the cognitive load task (accuracy and reaction time to choose the answer).</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment showed that the manipulation of cognitive load intensity was effective: both objective reaction time and subjective reports showed that cognitive load was indeed different under the four experimental task conditions. As cognitive load gradually increased in the four experimental conditions, the physiological arousal produced by the jumpscare also increased. This coincides with the hypothesis of the experiment.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the player’s self-reported psychological arousal did not change significantly with the change of cognitive load. The researchers said that this is likely because the reactions caused by jumpscares are difficult to detect through conscious awareness; there are also many other studies in related literature showing that emotional and physiological “stimulation” cannot be accurately captured by people in the form of self-reports. </p>

How to Better Apply “Jumpscares” in Game Design</h2><h3 id="Appropriate-Level-of-Scare"><a href="#Appropriate-Level-of-Scare" class="headerlink" title="Appropriate Level of Scare"></a>Appropriate Level of Scare</h3><p>For the game industry, the research by researchers at Aarhus University points out that unpleasant experiences in games can sometimes better allow players to gain pleasure, but it should be noted that when using negative emotions with unpleasant feelings, the scale should be grasped. The relationship between fear and pleasure is usually an inverted U-shape. Only when there is an appropriate amount of horror can the player experience be maximized. Too low or too high horror may be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Some overseas players have expressed problems on forums about the poor experience caused by horror games being too scary; for example, some players on Reddit said that Laura’s part in <em>The Evil Within</em> made them feel very tormented. In the use of jumpscares, the dosage also needs to be controlled. Some games will overuse this technique, which will cause the jumpscares to lose their effect over time; some players also said that the use of jumpscares in <em>Prey</em> is just right, and only one powerful scare is enough to make people remember it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F747fda51-09aa-4e45-98d4-fbf99952a999.webp/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2Fe7a07b4c-86c8-4e77-84d2-66c6d41412dd.webp/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios"><a href="#Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="Reasonable Usage Scenarios"></a>Reasonable Usage Scenarios</h3><p>In horror games, scaring players unexpectedly by letting them concentrate on puzzles, tasks, and other plots can greatly enhance the experience of horror. Game developers have already unintentionally applied this.</p>
<p>Of the more than 10,000 games under the “Horror” tag on the Steam store, more than 3,000 also have the “Puzzle” element tag. In the new game <em>Content Warning</em> released in 2024, the developers increased the cognitive load by letting players act as photographers in the game plot, enhancing the stimulation of horror scenes.</p>
<p>In horror games, the use of jumpscares is reasonable and natural, but how to use the jumpscare technique in non-horror themed games is relatively vague. In games where players can interact with the environment and other players, jumpscares can actually be used by players. Returning to the action of players hiding in the grass in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> mentioned at the beginning, it is precisely because the creations in the environment can be utilized that players are given room for self-expression and creation. When the cognitive load is high, the effect of this jumpscare will also be enhanced. Just as if a hidden player suddenly appears next to a player who is concentrating on picking up equipment, the effect of the jumpscare will be very strong. </p>

<p><em>In the Game 《Content Warning》, Players Act as Cameramen for Paranormal Event Streamers</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The use of jumpscares is very extensive in games. A good jumpscare can make players feel excited and memorable. Researchers at Aarhus University proposed the hypothesis that the level of cognitive load will affect the player’s experience of jumpscares, and verified this hypothesis through a horror game combined with a memory test.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that the higher the cognitive load, the stronger the stimulation felt by the player when experiencing jumpscares. Based on this conclusion, we can more cleverly combine the plot, tasks, or puzzle-solving components in the game with jumpscares to bring players a more interesting game experience.</p>

    <title>Why Are Players Obsessed with Virtual Avatars: From Custom Character Creation to Fashion Outfits</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the Barbie doll, popular in the toy market in 1959 for its interchangeable clothing, to the QQ Show, familiar to Generation Z, with its customizable outfits and interactive expressions, and from early single-player dress-up games with fixed character images and clothing to highly customizable online character creation systems with hundreds of body parameters. The game format of dressing up characters has been popular from the beginning, and after becoming a virtual avatar online, it has developed rapidly due to its freedom of appearance customization, and has gained a lot of attention and recognition from players. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F732f8c08-6a14-4868-a75b-5c49aec31282.webp/size/" alt="Example of Early Barbie Doll Types"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Early Barbie dolls with various career images</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In 2023, after the first cloud character creation experience of <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game was launched, it set a record for simultaneous online players within ten minutes. The topic of “part-time game character creators earning over 10,000 yuan per month” was once on the Weibo hot list, attracting widespread attention and discussion. The hottest character creation data in the official character creation station has more than 50,000 downloads, and the sharing and exchange of character creation data among active players in social media has become a daily routine, which shows that there is a huge demand for character creation among players in the game.</p>
<p>Why can character creation, as a form of shaping virtual images, trigger a player experience frenzy and demand far beyond everyone’s expectations? It is also worth thinking about why selling game fashion and appearances has become a business model accepted by players around the world. Why are players willing to pay for some high-quality and exquisite fashion that can only be worn in virtual images?</p>
<p>Next, this article will start from the psychological connection between the player and the game character, and analyze the reasons why players are so concerned about the fashion, character creation and other appearances of game characters.</p>
<h2 id="I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars"><a href="#I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars" class="headerlink" title="I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars"></a>I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars</h2><p>The avatar identification theory proposes that in the game environment, players project their self-identity onto the game character through interaction with the game character, forming a special psychological connection.</p>
<h3 id="The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar"><a href="#The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="The Origin of the Term Avatar"></a>The Origin of the Term Avatar</h3><p>The original Zelda game first allowed players to customize the protagonist’s name, and subsequent games gradually began to allow players to customize the protagonist’s clothing and appearance. Later, it was collectively referred to as: Avatar system. The word Avatar comes from Sanskrit. In Hinduism, Avatar is a special ability user who can change his image, and is generally regarded as the image of gods in the human world. That is to say, the game character, that is, the avatar, is the digital representation of the player, and the player imagines and experiences the emotions and viewpoints of the character from the game character.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-and-Projection"><a href="#Avatar-and-Projection" class="headerlink" title="Avatar and Projection"></a>Avatar and Projection</h3><p>Freud’s theory of personality structure believes that a person is composed of three parts: id, ego, and superego. The “id” follows the pleasure principle and contains a group of chaotic, instinctive, and suppressed desires. The “ego” follows the reality principle and satisfies the needs of the id under the conditions of real environment and moral standards. The “superego” follows the moral principle and contains moral ideals and conscience.</p>
<p>However, in real life, many desires of the id are restricted and cannot be realized. For example, office workers cannot travel and enjoy the beautiful mountains and rivers as they wish, but they can log in to the <em>Justice Online</em> game in their spare time and explore mountains and rivers in the dreamy and beautiful environment, so that their leisure exploration desires can be satisfied in another way. </p>

<p>The same is true in terms of appearance. For example, the <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game fashion [Star Palace] Pegasus skirt’s elegant and gorgeous design and court style can enable players to realize the dream of becoming a gorgeous female star that is difficult to achieve in daily life. It is the existence of a virtual avatar. It allows the desires for unfulfilled behaviors and appearances to have an object of projection and another possibility of realization. </p>

<h2 id="II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification"></a>II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification</h2><p>Studies have shown that avatars are not only seen as characters temporarily manipulated by players, but players also regard avatars as part of their self-concept. So how does this psychological connection explain players’ obsession with appearance and character creation?</p>
<p>The similarity between the virtual avatar and the player in terms of physical appearance, personality characteristics, race, etc. can promote the realization of avatar identification. When players choose or customize virtual images in the game, they are often based on the psychological mechanism of self-identification and projection. They hope to show their personality, interests, or ideal self through the character image in the game. This is why most players’ game character creation results have characteristics that are in line with their own aesthetics and character style settings</p>
<p>The game has developed a function in the character creation module that allows intelligent character creation based on pictures uploaded by players, allowing players who are not good at character creation to restore their beauty in the game with the help of AI tools. In addition, many players upload not photos of celebrity beauties, but their own photos. In the game, players actually carry out a kind of emotional projection by choosing or customizing the appearance of the character. With the support of AI technology and the addition of exquisite costumes in game design, virtual characters can be infinitely close to a player’s ideal image of themselves. What players project is the beautiful image they want to become, as players say: “Pinch yourself into a beautification, and what you pinch out is what I hope to grow into.. </p>

<h3 id="The-Proteus-Effect"><a href="#The-Proteus-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Proteus Effect"></a>The Proteus Effect</h3><p>The Proteus effect shows that when individuals are given specific character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits. This phenomenon originally came from the sea god Proteus in ancient Greek mythology, who had the ability to change his appearance, so the word “Proteus” is also used to refer to “ready to change shape and personality at any time”. In the game, by choosing or customizing the appearance and dress of the character, the player is actually setting a specific character image for himself, and showing the corresponding behavior pattern under this image.</p>
<h3 id="The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image"><a href="#The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="The Mask Function of Character Image"></a>The Mask Function of Character Image</h3><p>We can regard such a specific appearance image as a kind of “mask”, which is a symbol and sense of ritual to switch identities, and it is also a prop to increase the immersion of the new identity. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a national style martial arts game, in addition to the antique scenes, the ancient style appearance of the characters also allows players to quickly feel that they can travel to ancient times, and Ning Hongye’s blindfolded cloth strips and capable and neat fashion can also allow players to substitute into a brave and decisive swordsman identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F36a6b2fb-cdc3-47f4-9d7c-9e6e15be79ee.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>And when this “mask” does not meet the player’s conditions for identity setting, there will be a sense of incongruity. Therefore, in the design of game fashion, not only should we start from the era background and identity of the game character itself, but also combine the player’s inherent cognition of the character or a certain type of image to think.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Game characters are players’ virtual avatars in another world. Appearance customization and other features can promote players’ identification with the avatar. Players will invest their imagination of their ideal self in the avatar. Different appearance images are like a mask, allowing players to be more deeply immersed in the role of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, such projection cannot explain all players’ appearance settings for game characters. Perhaps in the eyes of some players, game character creation and fashion matching are a way of personalized self-expression. By choosing different appearances and dresses, players can show their uniqueness and creativity.</p>

    <title>Rejecting Stereotypes: What Kind of Game Characters Can Best Capture Players&#39; Hearts</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167413.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Games, as an important social medium, have one of their most important functions: the ability to quickly mobilize people’s emotions in a short period. In many games, one of the most common elements that mobilize players’ emotions is the game character. Because whether it is deeply exploring the plot or experiencing intense battles, the first thing players come into contact with is the character.</p>
<p>So what kind of game character can best capture the player’s heart in the first place? An important point is to enable players to truly immerse themselves in the role and experience the game immersively during the game, that is, to quickly enter a state of flow. The state that people show when they are focused on something is called flow by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. For example, when an artist is creating, when a player is engrossed in a game, their energy is completely invested in it, and at the same time, they have a strong sense of excitement and fulfillment. This is also why we sometimes play a game so “selflessly” that we ignore the passage of time.</p>
<p>When we talk about game characters, there are many ways to express the dimensions that are often mentioned. This article will focus on the visual image, persona, personality and other aspects of the character to explore what kind of game characters can capture the player’s heart and leave a unique and vivid impression.</p>
<h2 id="I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character"><a href="#I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="I. The External Image of the Character"></a>I. The External Image of the Character</h2><p>External image usually refers to the character’s shape, appearance, physical attributes, etc. When first getting to know a character, the first thing a player sees is their external image, and whether the player likes the character or not is often initially judged at first sight. Only when there is initial goodwill towards the character will there be an interest in further understanding the character.</p>
<p>For example, during the promotional period before the official launch of the character Ji Yingying in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, even in just 20 seconds of the trailer CG, players couldn’t resist her “smile back”, and almost couldn’t forget her face at first sight. An amazing first impression also laid a good foundation for Ji Yingying’s continued high popularity. After her hero’s actual gameplay demonstration was released, the skill effects based on the Wuchang Lock and Nether Fire also brought players a hearty battle experience, enhancing the sense of satisfaction from multiple senses.</p>
<p>Another example is YORHA No. 2 Type B (2B), one of the protagonists of <em>NieR: Automata</em>. She is the most popular character in the game and the most beautiful character in the hearts of players. Short white hair, blue-grey eyes, wearing a black blindfold (standard military goggles), carrying a silver-white samurai sword behind her, coupled with a black Gothic-style dress, the cool image surprised everyone as soon as it appeared. In addition, she always covers her eyes with a black half-face blindfold, revealing only a little bit of her face, which also casts a mysterious veil over this character. The form of wielding a giant weapon in battle, the agility, and the elegant action design, combined with the setting of a mecha-girl, are even more eye-catching.</p>
<h2 id="II-Character-Persona-Tags"><a href="#II-Character-Persona-Tags" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Persona Tags"></a>II. Character Persona Tags</h2><p>Giving characters some specific persona tags can enhance the richness and three-dimensionality of the characters and help establish psychological identification with players. This is the core process of closely connecting the player’s heart with the character, and it is also a crucial part of driving the player’s preferences and decision-making and other psychological mechanisms. When a character has prominent traits, it is easy for players to establish a good impression of them.</p>
<p>For example, previously, on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, the official released a vote, allowing players to choose the best series of games and characters in their minds. Among them, Emet-Selch from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> ranked first in the number of votes. One of the reasons why he is so popular with players is his distinctive and contrasting personality.</p>
<p>First of all, when he first appeared, the initial impression he gave players was a puzzling and very indifferent villain image. But with more in-depth contact and understanding later, his completely opposite gentle and careful side will gradually be revealed. Combined with his personal experience: although he is good at conspiracy and has killed many people, his inner obsession is ultimately just to find his relatives and revive his compatriots. This kind of flesh-and-blood, and very contrasting personality makes players love and hate him, and leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>Taking Ji Yingying as an example, in the story background of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, she is the most outstanding ghost messenger of the Wuchang Division, and she is a daunting existence in Morus Isle. Her hero introduction describes her as, “The infernal fire from the netherworld will burn all those who have betrayed her.” At the same time, her powerful combat ability also aroused the player’s admiration for the strong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, her persona is a “three-no girl”, silent, introverted, and keeping strangers away, which creates a sense of contrast, making players not only imagine that without emotions, it is hard to imagine how strong she would be. Looking at her life background, she was abandoned by her family since she was a child and bears the infernal fire of revenge as Bai Wuchang - players will always remember the character they deeply sympathized with. The persona tags discussed above can effectively evoke and strengthen the player’s emotions.</p>
<p>When a game character goes deep into the player’s mind, the character is established. We found in our research that when players examine their appearance and skins, they will also have a conventional answer based on the character’s image. Players are more concerned about the fit of fashion and characters. Factors such as lines, voice, hero stories, and character relationships that constitute the three-dimensionality of the character’s personality will affect the player’s judgment on whether a piece of fashion is beautiful and coordinated, and whether it has a story, and whether it can stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very risky to easily change the persona or create points that contradict the original persona. For example, the male character Temulch in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> was set from the beginning of the game as the bloodline of the prairie wolf king. “The legends of the ancestors are engraved in the mind, and the great glory is in front of you. The wolf from the prairie will run wildly again.” When he puts on a gorgeous dress, there are many players who stick to the persona, and they will feel very out of place.</p>
<h2 id="III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Inner Character of the Character"></a>III. The Inner Character of the Character</h2><p>Inner personality usually refers to the character’s internal tendencies and psychological characteristics, in terms of thinking and behavior towards people, things, and themselves. Just like the popularity of MBTI tests among friends in recent years, some personality tests are popular because they can give people more recognition and a sense of belonging from a psychological point of view. When everyone has their own “personality label”, they can quickly establish and deepen people’s understanding of each other.</p>
<p>People always yearn to understand their own hearts and are obsessed with finding similar souls that resonate with them. In the game, when a character’s internal personality is rich and three-dimensional enough, it also has the importance of conveying emotions. Players’ preferences for the personality traits of game characters also vary from person to person. These characteristics can be confident, humorous, vulnerable, kind, brave; they can be like Astarion in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, with a complex but unique personality; they can be like Geralt in <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, a mature and professional witcher, providing players with a deep sense of empowerment and helping them deal with powerful enemies; or you can also fall in love with Tali in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, and she doesn’t even have a face.</p>
<p>The above are examples of popular game character images with distinct characteristics that are loved by players all over the world. They are unique in the hearts of players and can also resonate strongly with players. At the same time, there are also many characters that are relatively unattractive. We found in player research that players will give feedback such as “no impression”, “not sure what he (in the story) wants to do, what is his goal”, “seems to see the shadow of several existing characters”, etc. for some characters who have a relatively low sense of existence in some games, that is, the characterization is “stereotyped”.</p>
<p>The stereotyped here does not refer to the visual image of the face. After all, many games now support personalized face customization. Players can customize their faces according to their own preferences, or even photos. The character stereotype discussed in this article focuses more on internal personality traits.</p>
<p>For example, in our research on a certain game, based on the data fed back by players, we compared the similarity of personality traits of two male characters and found that the similarity of the two in various dimensions is extremely high. This is also the reason why players are confused and ask “the two are indistinguishable”. If there is no difference in internal personality, it will be difficult to create a memorable character in the subsequent development of the character line.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In many scenarios where we usually contact users, whether it is about art or gameplay, players always tend to focus on characters. By shaping a memorable character, we can better understand the motivation and emotional connection of players to experience the game, and also better understand how to deepen the attraction and psychological identification of players in the game.</p>
<p>The above is a preliminary exploration of character shaping in game design. In addition, the character’s special skills, dubbing, etc. are also sufficient manifestations to help shape its three-dimensional image and identity. Of course, when talking about a certain character, we are definitely not looking at it from a single dimension. Only by fully considering many factors such as the character’s appearance, background, personality, and setting can we create a distinctive and beloved character.</p>

    <title>Help! Why is This Boss Music Stuck in My Head!</title>
    <url>/2024/04/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20240716_28584_1167423/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167423.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> previously released Mirror Pavilion dungeon, the music for one of the outer pavilion bosses, Nan Wenxue, left a particularly deep impression on players. It was able to effectively mobilize players’ emotions, making them feel the poignancy and murderous intent from Nan Wenxue, creating a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>This sparked thought: why do we have such a strong memory of some music? And how can this phenomenon be explained from a psychological perspective?</p>
<p>Comments on the NetEase Cloud Music page for “You Mei Xiao Gu” (Withered Plum Bone), the boss music for Mirror Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue are positive, and refer to it’s quality.</p>
<h2 id="I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work"><a href="#I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work" class="headerlink" title="I. How Attention and Memory Work"></a>I. How Attention and Memory Work</h2><p>Before further explaining this phenomenon through examples, we need to first understand how the human brain’s attention and memory work.</p>
<h3 id="Memory"><a href="#Memory" class="headerlink" title="Memory"></a>Memory</h3><p>When receiving external information, this information first enters sensory memory, then enters short-term memory, and then enters long-term memory after a series of encodings.</p>
<p>Sensory memory usually refers to memory of about 1 second. Here, the brain will quickly perceive a large amount of information from the outside world, but at the same time, most of the information will also disappear quickly. Only the information that is noticed will enter short-term memory.</p>
<p>If we were to use a computer’s working mode as an analogy, short-term memory can be compared to cache. It passively stores the audio-visual information we hear and see, although it allows us to quickly retrieve memories. It cannot store a large amount of content at one time, and its capacity is relatively small.</p>
<p>Long-term memory is RAM. Comparatively, it can store more content and has a larger capacity, but it requires us to deliberately and actively save information, and the process of saving information is relatively time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="Attention"><a href="#Attention" class="headerlink" title="Attention"></a>Attention</h3><p>Everyone’s brain has a certain amount of “cognitive resources”, and exceeding the limit will cause “cognitive load.” In the case of a large amount of information constantly stimulating the brain every minute and every second, how does the brain process this information to avoid cognitive load?</p>
<p>The answer is through “attention.” Attention has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> The brain will selectively attend to some information while ignoring other information.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The brain will eliminate irrelevant stimuli to ensure that information is concentrated.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> The brain’s operation is linear, so “attention”, which is very important in the process of filtering information, also needs to remain stable for a certain period.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Often, we are not fully invested in a single event. When doing two or more things at the same time, it will involve the allocation of attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was mentioned above that the brain will eliminate irrelevant information stimuli, so how does the brain reduce interference?</p>
<p>The human brain has an area specifically responsible for suppressing irrelevant interference input. When the auditory area and the visual area are triggered at the same time, the prefrontal cortex will selectively inhibit the relatively less important area according to the importance of the information. By suppressing the information flow of the unimportant area, the information flow of another area will become relatively more prominent.</p>
<h2 id="II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories"><a href="#II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories" class="headerlink" title="II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?"></a>II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?</h2><p>After understanding how the brain works in attention and memory, let’s look at how the brain remembers music.</p>
<p>When playing games and listening to some game music with specific tonality, we use short-term memory more, in which “short-term musical memory” plays a key role.</p>
<p>What the brain remembers is not a complete melody, but the harmonic structure carried by the melody. In the previous article, “<em>How Games Control Your Emotions Through Music</em>,” it was mentioned that harmony will determine the emotional color of the melody to a certain extent. Whether it is happy or sad, excited or relaxed, and harmonic progression will constitute the development direction of the music, whether it is moving towards the climax or coming to the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, our brain will remember this harmonic context, and will further understand the melody heard based on this harmonic context.</p>
<p>In the process of remembering music with only one tonality, it is normal to have a few unclear memories. Switching to the scene of recalling and retrieving musical memories, the brain will try to fill in this note in the process of outlining the melody. The logic of filling in is based on the melody contour, and a relatively close alternative note is located from the tonality constituted by the harmonic context to fill in this vacancy.</p>
<h2 id="III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering"><a href="#III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering" class="headerlink" title="III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?"></a>III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?</h2><p>In our previous research, we found that in most cases, players tend to not care about the specific details of the battle music, but just “listen to a sound”, or more accurately, listen to the “emotional atmosphere.”</p>
<p>So, why is there this phenomenon?</p>
<p>During battle, there will be many changes in vision, such as the attack direction of the big boss and the operations of teammates. At the same time, hearing will also continue to transmit various battle information, scene information, and so on. Under the bombardment of a large amount of information, in order to avoid cognitive load, the brain will allocate cognitive resources from top to bottom, choosing to focus attention on the more important battle and ignoring other information, so as to better adjust battle strategies based on information changes.</p>
<p>Zooming in on the brain’s operation, at this time, the prefrontal cortex will inhibit part of the auditory information flow, so that the visual information flow is more obvious and easier to remember.</p>
<p>At the level of conscious awareness, auditory attention is more biased towards listening to the content of teammates opening the microphone, and at the same time, background music will be ignored, because it is necessary to cooperate with teammates. But this does not mean that the background music is useless. At this time, the role of the background music is more biased towards the subconscious level, mainly acting on the arousal of emotions, making people feel the passionate atmosphere of the battle.</p>
<p>This leads to another question, why do some people feel that playing music while playing games interferes with their strategic thinking, while others feel more passionate and immersive?</p>
<p>In fact, everyone’s cognitive resources are different, some are high and some are low, and there are individual differences. Among them, people with larger cognitive resource capacity can process more information at the same time. At the same time, everyone’s focus on information is also different. People who care about the sense of immersion brought by game music will be more easily immersed in the emotional atmosphere created by the music, while people who don’t care may feel that the music interferes with their thinking.</p>
<p>But no matter which group of people, everyone’s primary memory is the emotional atmosphere brought by the music, not the details of the music. Generally speaking, without prompts, players cannot directly recall what the battle music is like.</p>
<p><em>Justice Online Mobile</em> has corresponding city music for different cities. Some will change with the day and night and the weather, so that you can be immersed in it when exploring or running around.</p>
<p>Unlike battles, when exploring and running around, cognitive resources are no longer highly concentrated on a certain matter, players are more open to information, and their attention will also be more dispersed. At this time, they can pay attention to some small designs, whether it is scene sound effects such as birdsong, water flow, or background music. This is also why players are more likely to recall exploration music with distinct melodic characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered"><a href="#IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered" class="headerlink" title="IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?"></a>IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?</h2><p>Returning to the original question, why can the music of <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> boss Nan Wenxue be remembered?</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody"><a href="#Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody"></a>Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody</h3><p>In this boss music, the production team incorporated vocal design. This means that when players listen to this piece of music, in addition to the music information, there is actually text information, and the brain will also process the lyrics in an additional layer. This makes the human voice stand out among a bunch of instruments. This strong contrast effect will also make it easier for players to notice the human voice, and then notice the music.</p>
<p><em>The south branch is withered, the wind holds the snow and turns, don’t let it fall. The fragrance disappears, the plum blossoms scatter, and the floating life follows the flowing water. - Lyrics of “You Mei Xiao Gu”</em></p>
<h3 id="Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics"><a href="#Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics"></a>Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous article, the effect of music and gameplay is often 1+1&gt;2. On the basis of excellent gameplay mechanism design, Nan Wenxue’s vocal singing coordinates well with the gameplay. It roughly appears shortly before and after the appearance of the Peach Blossom Girl, setting off the atmosphere and making players feel the “killing intent” from the boss.</p>
<p>Why is it effective at this node? This is because here, except for individual players who need to focus on the position of the boss, most of the others are in a state of pure fighting without needing to think too much about battle and positioning strategies. Players’ cognitive resources still have a lot of spare capacity at this node to notice corresponding design details.</p>
<h3 id="Repetitive-Stimulation"><a href="#Repetitive-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Repetitive Stimulation"></a>Repetitive Stimulation</h3><p>The Mirror Pavilion·Outer Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue, the dungeon boss, is both an interesting and challenging dungeon boss in this raid. Because there is a certain degree of difficulty, and the dungeon is an important channel for equipment upgrades, players will continue to participate in this dungeon. The impressive female vocal singing of “You Mei Xiao Gu” is also set in the boss stage that players will experience. This means that players will generally experience this piece of music once every time they participate in this dungeon. Like the learning process, this repeated emphasis and stimulation can deepen the brain’s memory of the music segment, thereby making the music more likely to enter long-term memory, making people have an impression and remember it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, understanding the player’s attention and memory patterns, including the neural operation process of the brain, can assist the development team in designing details in the game that better meet the needs of the experience. In the process of designing music, it is also necessary to linearly and structurally understand the process and rhythm of the entire gameplay. Doing the right design at the right node can achieve better results.</p>

    <title>Why Do Players Turn a Blind Eye? Novice Guide Design from the Perspective of Attention Mechanisms</title>
    <url>/2024/03/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20240717_28584_1167643/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167643.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When players experience a new game or new gameplay, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play. On the other hand, game designers feel very confused. The game clearly has a large section of gameplay introduction, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Why do players always “turn a blind eye” to the carefully prepared novice guides by developers? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it? In a previous article, we mainly analyzed what kind of information is easier to be seen from the perspective of involuntary attention.</p>
<p>First, let’s do a brief review.</p>
<p>What is attention? -&gt; If the human brain is a TV, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. What is involuntary attention? -&gt; Those that do not require willful effort and can be naturally noticed by people. For example, a ringing mobile phone in a quiet conference room is hard not to be heard.</p>
<p>What information is easier to attract involuntary attention, that is, easier for players to see (pay attention to)?</p>
<ul>
<li>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated. Such as novel stimuli (more pictures than words, more words than pictures), stimuli with higher relative intensity (such as darkening for emphasis), and motion changes (such as dynamic effects).</li>
<li>The information fits the person’s own state, interests, and needs. For example, when a new player encounters a brand-new function that needs to be used immediately, he will have a clear need for the novice tutorial. At this time, the pop-up guide will be more easily noticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the characteristics of attention, the inspiration for novice guide design is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast effect 1: More pictures, look at words; more words, look at pictures; highlight the differences.</li>
<li>Contrast effect 2: Less is more; the more blank space, the easier it is to be seen.</li>
<li>Multi-channel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation.</li>
<li>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text are, the better the learning (any form of prompt clues can guide players to pay attention to the key points faster).</li>
<li>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in the actual novice guide design, if the planner makes it according to the above standards, can it be ensured that the player can see it? Not necessarily. Specific problems still need specific analysis. In this article, we will present several conclusions that are different from the previous sharing, and will still explain why this happens from the perspective of attention.</p>
<h2 id="I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”"><a href="#I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”" class="headerlink" title="I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?"></a>I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?</h2><p>Let’s start with a non-prize quiz. In the following guidance screen about Parry in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, where do you think the player’s visual focus will be. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fed990d34-bf9b-4198-b60e-341aea98b4bd.webp/size/" alt="Image of Naraka: Bladepoint Parry tutorial"></p>
<p>There will mainly be 3 answers to this experiment. One answer is on the character, one answer is on the restraint relationship diagram in the upper left corner, and a few answers are on the controller diagram in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, none of the above answers are correct. The eye-tracking test results show an answer that surprises everyone. Players only saw the animation at the beginning, and then focused on the text below, and did not watch the animation demonstration again. And this is not just an individual case of one player. In the test of 10 players, 7-8 similar guide video contents in the game guide, the player’s focus is not on the video, but on the text.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Generally, we will think that vivid and visual pictures and personally demonstrated videos will be more focused on by players, and they will have more patience to watch them than boring text introductions, helping players learn some complex operations.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another type of attention - “voluntary attention”. In contrast to “involuntary attention”, “voluntary attention” is a conscious act of paying attention that requires willful effort. When we need to learn complex knowledge, we need the real “top student” type of “voluntary attention” to play.</p>
<p>As the eye-tracking data shows, at the beginning of the video, the player’s attention is attracted by the animation. At this time, “involuntary attention” is playing a role, which is in line with the principle that the higher the stimulus intensity, the more attention it attracts. But soon, the player finds that he can’t understand this animation. At this time, voluntary attention comes into play. For voluntary attention, familiarity is an important influencing factor. The more familiar things are, the faster the processing starts, and the easier it is to attract people’s attention at this time. Compared with the animation that cannot be understood, Chinese characters are still more familiar, so the brain is more inclined to process the text below, which is more helpful for understanding this guide. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2d43d828-ea76-44ba-b3f2-df5c60af63aa.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking data"></p>
<p>For the same guide, if it is shown to players who are already familiar with <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, their focus will be more on the video, because they are familiar with the various elements in the video and can quickly understand the information conveyed by the video interpretation. But for new players, the attack moves, blue light, and white light elements in the video are all unfamiliar, let alone understanding the relationship between them through interpretation.</p>
<p>Under the same conditions, the information transmission effect of video is better than that of text, and it is more able to capture attention. This is beyond doubt. This is also a place where it is easier to fall into the trap. Believing in the video theory transmission effect of video pictures, but ignoring the understandability of video pictures, will make players turn to complex text guidance with a low ceiling but a lower threshold.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for designers to find that players have this unexpected behavior through their own tests, because the familiarity of planners and players with this video is completely different. Combining the characteristics of voluntary attention, in this guide video, if the presentation of key elements or relationships can be matched with brief text descriptions that players are more “familiar” with, it can better capture the player’s attention and also help understanding.</p>
<h2 id="II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It"><a href="#II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It" class="headerlink" title="II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?"></a>II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?</h2><p>Does this desperate situation really exist? Yes, it does. Are players really so reluctant to read guides? No, sometimes they really don’t see them.</p>
<p>In the attention processing mechanism, we have a theory called the cognitive resource theory. This theory regards “attention” as a set of cognitive resources or cognitive abilities to classify and identify stimuli. These cognitive resources are limited. When the stimulus is more complex or the processing task is more complex, the more cognitive resources are occupied. When cognitive resources are fully occupied, new stimuli will not be processed. This is what we call the state of “turning a deaf ear to the outside world and concentrating on reading only the books of sages”.</p>
<p>At this time, it is easier for us to understand why the eye-tracking trajectory diagram of the following novice guide appears like this. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7de25631-f8af-4107-8428-a29489b15c60.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking on a tutorial screen"></p>
<p>From this picture, we can also find that the player’s focus is completely concentrated on the surrounding scene, that is, the things that are highly related to the current task. They are focusing on performing the task at hand, so they turn a deaf ear to such obvious guidance prompts above. In the actual test, most of the players also stated that they did not see the prompt text above.</p>
<p>But for us who are looking at such pictures, because we don’t need to consider the tasks that the player is currently performing, the attention processing resources are not occupied. The guide text above, “Double-click the A+D keys to roll in the specified direction and avoid the slash”, is very easy to attract our attention, and almost no one will not see it.</p>
<p>The more cognitive resources are occupied, the more concentrated the attention, and the smaller the scope of attention. In tasks that require identifying the details of things, the human field of vision is only about 1-2 degrees. This size is about the size of your thumbnail when you hold your arm parallel. When we get information, we don’t look at ten lines at a glance, but our eyeballs are constantly turning and shifting the point of gaze.</p>
<p>When the eyeball is stationary, the human visual coverage is about 220 degrees. But when you need to identify the details of things, such as reading text or recognizing a logo, you need to continuously rotate your eyeballs to project the position you want to know to the fovea of the retina (Fovea - a small depression in the center of the retina cone cells, that is, the macula, which can perceive the richest image details). This is also the principle of the eye tracker. The eye tracking system is mainly capturing the gaze points and the transfer behavior between gaze points. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F97bdeb4b-0109-4a9a-a3bb-fa446080f050.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of human eye and visual field"></p>
<p>In response to this situation, a common practice is to place auxiliary information as much as possible within the range of concentrated attention. For example, the head-up display of a car. When driving, the attention is mainly focused on observing the road conditions, and the gaze range is mainly concentrated in the windshield range. The information on the traditional car dashboard is relatively difficult to be noticed during driving. Therefore, some new cars try to display driving assistance information on the windshield. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0cf66d46-3c68-4a97-89e0-294700a8a8fc.webp/size/" alt="Example of a car&#39;s head-up display"></p>
<p>In games, some better practices are to put the guide on the task-related gaze path, or next to the character or weapon that the player gazes at more, which can ensure that the prompt information can be noticed more effectively. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> places button prompts on the target scene; <em>God of War</em> displays some operation guides next to the axe. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F4dc46fcc-ef41-497e-8f5a-225d4d4086e5.webp/size/" alt="Examples of in-game guides placed near points of interest"></p>
<h2 id="III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?"></a>III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?</h2><p>From the above several cases, we understand that when players concentrate on performing game tasks, the scope of attention is very small. The gaze point is mostly distributed near the task-related path and the character. So do all prompt information need to be stacked near the character? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another attention processing theory, the dual processing theory of attention: human cognitive processing has two types: automatic processing and conscious controlled processing. The former is not limited by cognitive resources, does not require attention, and can be carried out automatically; the latter is limited by cognitive resources, requires attention, and can be continuously adjusted according to changes in the environment. That is, when performing multiple activities at the same time, one or more of them have become automated processes, and individuals no longer need to consume cognitive resources, and they can concentrate their attention on other cognitive processes. Consciously controlled processing may be transformed into automatic processing after a lot of practice. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2b4eaad9-5b58-42a2-9913-1a997cf0d8d2.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of the dual processing theory of attention"></p>
<p>Therefore, although our processing resources are limited, if we can automatically process more information, we can cover more and more comprehensive information. Experience can transform the content of voluntary attention into automatic processing, which does not occupy cognitive resources, so that more information can be processed.</p>
<p>In games, the most obvious manifestation is the difference in the gaze range between veterans and novices. As can be seen from the figure below, the visual range of both new and veteran players is centered on themselves. However, the visual attention range of veteran players is larger, accounting for more than 1&#x2F;3 of the whole; the visual attention range of novice players is smaller, about 1&#x2F;4 of the whole. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7fc21bf4-ec25-43ef-b26f-a2da0a52c62b.webp/size/" alt="Comparison of gaze range between novice and veteran players"></p>
<p>Veterans can achieve a good degree of automatic identification of tasks such as character movement and combat, so they have more attention resources to notice other information prompts that appear on the interface, and can also gaze at a larger range of interface information to complete tasks when needed, such as the skill bar at the bottom.</p>
<p>This attention processing feature has many inspirations for developers. First of all, for the design of novice guidance prompts, the position of guidance prompts does need to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. Secondly, the interface display information is gradually unfolded step by step, so that players can adapt first, become proficient in a basic content, so that they can gradually enter automatic processing, and then enter the next. By gradually transforming the information processing process of some basic tasks into automatic processing, the amount of information that novice players can process at the same time is gradually expanded.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, let’s make a review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text is not necessarily inferior to pictures, because in real information processing tasks, voluntary attention mainly plays a role, and familiarity is an important influencing factor. Users tend to process familiar information sources that are more conducive to information processing. Therefore, if the video format is used for guidance, the understandability of the video content presentation is very important.</li>
<li>When performing real tasks, the gaze range is very limited, and the gaze range is strongly related to task-related elements, such as being more concentrated near the character and task path. Therefore, some important information that needs to be noticed by the player can be displayed in these areas.</li>
<li>The information processing range of novices is very limited. First, the position of guidance prompts needs to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. At the same time, it is necessary to gradually display information, so that players can gradually process automatically and expand the range of information that can be processed at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, in the novice guide design, it is also necessary to consider the player’s own information familiarity and the characteristics of attention in actual task execution. It is not possible to simply rely on common image display rules, and specific analysis should be made for specific situations.</p>

    <title>How Can Game Plots Better Elicit Player Empathy</title>
    <url>/2024/02/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20240717_28584_1167669/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167669.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone suffers, and no one readily accepts tragedy. In today’s era, people are tired of and even disgusted by consistently happy endings in stories, while also complaining about “knife-inflicting” (creating sad, regretful scenes) plots in entertainment content.  Especially in games, which are meant for entertainment, the inclusion of one heartbreaking scene after another often sparks heated discussions among players.</p>
<p>When players immerse themselves in the game world, savoring the scenes created and the stories written by the developers, they generally ask: Do developers have to “stab” players a few times in the process to get their kicks?  When “stabbed” (seeing heartbreaking scenes), it often triggers strong emotional reactions in players. Why do developers choose to deliver endless “knives” despite the potential backlash?</p>
<h2 id="I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game"><a href="#I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game"></a>I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game</h2><p>The plot in a game has always been responsible for creating a sense of immersion for the player.</p>
<p>Game characters are, after all, virtual. So how do you make players emotionally resonate with them and fully remember them? The emotional ups and downs and character settings brought about by the plot are particularly critical. The establishment of player emotions requires a fluctuating process. They may forget the lines a character once said, but they will definitely find it difficult to forget the scenes that can bring them intense emotional fluctuations. Therefore, developers sometimes choose to create many sad scenes in the plot to promote the development of the plot, arouse changes in player emotions, and further portray the characters.</p>
<p>Like Haurchefant in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, from an insignificant stranger at the beginning, to gradually forming a connection, and finally being killed by a sneak attack. Thinking of the shelter he once provided, the two cups of hot drinks he held, covering the player’s retreat at the Skyfire Locks, standing up for the player in the trial duel, and even personally training a Chocobo for the player, any user would find it difficult to forget this guy who always calls you “my friend.”</p>
<p>There is a Zeigarnik effect in psychology, which refers to the fact that people tend to remember unfinished things or interrupted work, and there is an inherent concept of having a beginning and an end in human nature, so they will be obsessed with things that have no results. When players do not see the content they expect, they will also remember it deeply. When the visual presentation and gameplay do not have much room to stimulate, players will be distressed by the tragic fate of the characters in the plot, thereby mobilizing emotions, and naturally they can remember this feeling, and thus remember this character and this plot, and even like these characters. Perhaps only a deep “feeling of being stabbed” can indicate that the plot has truly touched the player’s heart.</p>
<h2 id="II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”"><a href="#II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”" class="headerlink" title="II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?"></a>II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?</h2><p>So why must it be sadness and regret? Can’t “sweetness” (designing many beautiful scenes and bridges) trigger emotional fluctuations in players?</p>
<p>Perceived control in psychology believes that people believe that they can control themselves and the places, people, objects, emotions, and activities around them. When facing a stranger, if he is doing well, the emotion we first produce is to compare. When you feel that you can’t be as good as the other person, you will have a lower sense of control, and it is easier to develop an inferiority complex, which in turn leads to jealousy or other bad emotions. On the contrary, if this person has gone through hardships and has a bumpy fate, what is more generated is sympathy, and further, a feeling of compassion.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the game plot alone, if a plot “has no knives”, the character has no changes, and everything is very good and smooth, the player may instead feel disgusted, unreal, and even more serious boredom. In games, NPCs and characters who are plain or live a happy life are often not remembered by us, and are more like passers-by.</p>
<p>Tragedy is always easier to touch people’s hearts and resonate with than comedy; that’s why it’s always said that the core of comedy is tragedy, otherwise how can a simple comedy move the audience, let alone make people talk about it with relish afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors"><a href="#III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors" class="headerlink" title="III. Immersion and Mental Anchors"></a>III. Immersion and Mental Anchors</h2><h3 id="Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions"><a href="#Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions"></a>Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions</h3><p>Developers often say that they want to give players a sense of immersion, using visuals and plots to instill emotions into the player’s mind. Immersion is a very mysterious concept. During the game experience, players have positive and negative emotional fluctuations. When positive emotions are dominant, they will experience a focused pleasure and have the motivation to invest in it, entering a state of enjoyment. For example, when a player finishes a plot in the game or passes a relatively difficult level, they burst out with a positive emotional catharsis, and thus experience a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>However, games are often not all about positive emotions. It is necessary to allow players to have a certain degree of negative emotional fluctuations to avoid fatigue and boredom caused by long-term positive feelings. If negative emotions are created through game mechanics and difficulty, it is easy to cause imbalance, leading to direct churn and discouragement. Developers usually adopt more gentle, more widely accepted tragic plots to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch"><a href="#Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch"></a>Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch</h3><p>Mental anchor is a form of conditioned reflex, which refers to “the connection between a certain mood in a person’s heart and a certain action or expression, resulting in a conditioned reflex”. In short, it’s like a switch. When we see this thing, we will have different moods associated with it. We can call such things that can stimulate special feelings, whether good or bad, mental anchors. It’s like a bookmark placed in the heart, which can be used when needed, and the psychological state at the time of setting the mental anchor can be retrieved. Therefore, a mental anchor is more like a “re-experiencing”.</p>
<p>And in games, similar to gameplay types, when we mention a type, we will think of its representative work; in the plot, when we see a flag, we will think of a tragic ending. Just as assassination and parkour gameplay will remind us of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, Cthulhu investigators will easily remind us of <em>Bloodborne</em>, and when we see several corpses and last words in a shelter in <em>The Last of Us</em>, we will naturally depict in our minds a story of a poor person who had to kill a child to prevent the child from becoming a zombie. The game provides classic elements, combines them with various elements in the scene and level, and activates the mental anchors in the player’s mind through scene scheduling, creating an illusion of the plot in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor"><a href="#How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor" class="headerlink" title="How to Build a Mental Anchor"></a>How to Build a Mental Anchor</h3><p>When enough immersion and positive emotions are created in the early stage, and the emotional fluctuations are large enough, a positive mental anchor is buried. The player has positive expectations for the plot and creates their own fantasy of the plot. Or it may further arouse the player’s curiosity, resulting in the idea of “there must be a pit buried here, I must play it to find out, to see if it is the same as I thought”. In the later stage, when “handing out knives” to design heartbreaking scenes, players will also perceive something wrong because of other memories before, activating the mental anchor, and “Run, there are knives here” is the most intuitive feeling.</p>
<p>The strong contrast and the conflict between mental anchors cause strong emotional fluctuations in players. Grasping this emotional change of the player, it makes the player have a deep memory point for this plot and this character. This buries the next mental anchor, so that the next time the player encounters an emotional switch, they will have a sense of déjà vu: “Hey, have I experienced this before?”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the interesting plot is never in the game, but in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In the final analysis, designing “knives” such as tragic plots is just a tool. With a good knife, the characters will be vividly portrayed, the plot conflicts will also be vividly depicted, and the player’s heart will also be “stabbed” severely. After all, although heartbreaking scenes are bitter, they are indispensable. If the “knife” is not given properly, it is just to stimulate the player’s emotions by “tearing up the canvas”, which is more like simply spreading unreasonable negative emotions, with a mentality of “Didn’t expect it, look how bitter it is”, and most players may not buy it. A person who can’t draw a circle with a pen and casually draws an abstract painting will not become a master of art.</p>
<p>The essence of the game is still to be happy, right?</p>

Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?"></a>I. Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?</h2><p>Unlike traditional paper maps, the icon design in the game map interface needs to include various forms of content other than geographical location information. The following list basically encompasses all icons that may appear in an open-world map interface.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular locations:</strong> Mark locations in the game world that players can explore.</li>
<li><strong>Character&#x2F;Important item locations:</strong> Indicate the current location or direction of characters or important items.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Travel points:</strong> Allow players to teleport directly from their current location to the indicated location.</li>
<li><strong>Reminder markers:</strong> Alert players to unfinished tasks or unclaimed items.</li>
<li><strong>User-defined markers:</strong> In some games, players can choose an icon provided by the map system to mark a specific location.</li>
<li><strong>Direction indicators:</strong> Crucial in vast environments; some maps have compass-like icons.</li>
<li><strong>Crosshair and cursor:</strong> Tools for selecting locations, commonly used in maps navigated with a controller or keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>External map information:</strong> Provides details such as longitude and latitude, weather, and time.</li>
</ul>

Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?"></a>II. Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?</h2><p>Virtual game environments, similar to real-world scenes, interact with people through various “touch points”.</p>
<p>In a game scene, touch points can be various special scenes, objects, or characters (like NPCs). Maps typically present these touch points to the player in a 2D or 2.5D format. When players switch from the map interface back to the 3D game scene, a sense of disconnect is inevitable. Therefore, the higher the usability of the icons, the more players can focus their attention on the game scene, enhancing their immersive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately"><a href="#Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately" class="headerlink" title="Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately"></a>Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately</h3><p>To avoid players repeatedly switching between the map and the game scene to confirm information, ensuring a continuous gameplay experience, developers need to make it easy for players to understand the connection between map icons and touch points in the game scene.</p>
<p>The essence of icon design lies in symbol selection. Appropriate symbols make it easier for players to understand the meaning of icons, thus making their meanings easier to comprehend. Additionally, icon materials should align with the game world’s setting, ensuring clarity while considering the narrative.</p>
<p>For example, consider icons with a “teleport” function. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the teleport icon (fast travel) resembles a location marker on a modern map. In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the teleport icon is based on the shrines in Hyrule. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, the teleport icon (Site of Grace) is drawn from the actual Site of Grace in the game world. These icons not only allow players to quickly understand their meaning but also enhance the game’s narrative. </p>

Adding text prompts to icons is the simplest way to enhance learnability.</p>
<p>Firstly, text content should minimize redundant information, as extra text doesn’t exist in the real world, and excessive text descriptions disrupt the player’s sense of realism and immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6c8304e6-4eef-4dfe-a229-2e7ac86f66cf.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, only a keyboard icon and the word “Teleport” are used as an instruction.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Secondly, ensure that text prompts are visually easy to read, reducing the player’s visual load and improving reading efficiency. The text’s presentation should also be consistent in design with text in other game interfaces, ensuring that the text system as a whole is easily understood by players. </p>

Players mainly interact with icons using a mouse, keyboard, or controller thumbstick (excluding tablet games for now). Therefore, icon size is a crucial factor in determining operability.</p>
<p>Obviously, larger icons are easier to select. However, to display as much information as possible and avoid excessively large icons affecting the player’s visual and operational experience, icon design must first determine its activation area.</p>
<p>In the most common interface where a mouse is used to select icons, due to the mouse’s high precision and speed, icons can have a smaller activation area to increase overall map information density.  When using a keyboard or controller thumbstick, the selection process is more complex, requiring larger icon activation areas. </p>

Developers must first strike a balance between conveying information and providing an immersive experience, then determine how to make icons appropriately attractive.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, icons have low attractiveness, blending closely with the map background. Players must focus more on identifying terrain features (like mountains and rivers), inadvertently building a stronger macroscopic memory of the game environment. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the attractiveness of different icon categories should be differentiated. Levels should be assigned based on factors like access frequency and contribution to game progress. However, too many levels can lead to sorting confusion. More levels also imply a wider range of visual weights, potentially making some icons too jarring or too subtle, increasing the player’s visual burden. Typically, icon attractiveness levels should not exceed four. </p>

The least correlated and most common icons provide location information, usually presenting scene details to the player through images and text. Next are teleportation points; players select and click an icon to travel to the corresponding location. The most strongly correlated icons are location markers. Since players need to find the marked location in the scene, the design of these icons must closely integrate with markers within the scene.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, players have six differently colored map pins to mark locations. When switching to the game scene, using the telescope reveals corresponding colored light pillars, guiding the character to the marked location.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the design of these icons is inspired by the light pillars in the scene, enhancing clarity and integrating well with the environment. Furthermore, the glowing effect on the icons mirrors the light effects in the scene. </p>

    <title>Silent Communication in Games: An Essential Tool for Creating Immersive Experiences</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167686.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Language communication is an indispensable form of interaction between players in the game. In different types of games, players can use language communication for socializing, commanding, collaborating, and other behaviors.</p>
<p>There are many definitions of language. This article adopts the definition of “viewing language as a system of human communication, either spoken or symbolic.” Therefore, the language communication referred to in this article includes both voice communication and text communication between players in the game. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players can turn on the microphone to discuss tactics, and in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, players can use text to chat privately in the chat system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F430e70ae-18d9-4a9b-add4-c39f6efdb973.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The text chat system of “Final Fantasy XIV”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, language is not the only way for players to communicate. There are also a variety of non-verbal communication forms in the game. The interactive forms of non-verbal communication are usually related to gameplay. For example, in some games, the mechanics determine that players can only communicate with each other through the environment. For example, in some games, developers have removed language-related communication methods, and players can only “communicate” through non-verbal character interaction behaviors in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, non-verbal communication methods will also appear in competitive games as an auxiliary communication method for language communication. The diverse expressions of non-verbal communication between players not only enrich the interactive forms in the game, but also help the game achieve smoother social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F3f9b37cd-be12-4880-9200-dad7d792316e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Final Fantasy XIV” use emotional actions to interact</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Compared with the directness of language communication, non-verbal communication methods bring players into the virtual avatars in the game (the characters controlled by players in the game), further increasing the player’s sense of game immersion. At the same time, restrictive non-verbal communication methods also control the input of malicious voice communication to a certain extent, reducing the negative emotional experience of players.</p>
<p>This article will discuss the non-verbal communication methods in the game, combined with some game cases, to analyze the considerations of its experience design.</p>

Non-Verbal Communication Methods Between Players"></a>I. Non-Verbal Communication Methods Between Players</h2><p>Generally speaking, non-verbal communication methods can be divided into the following three categories.</p>
<h3 id="Preset-Game-“Commands”"><a href="#Preset-Game-“Commands”" class="headerlink" title="Preset Game “Commands”"></a>Preset Game “Commands”</h3><p>This refers to the command integration prepared in advance by the game producer according to the game play and game content. Players can effectively choose from the limited preset commands and share them with teammates.</p>
<p>Its manifestation in the game is: these preset expressions are classified, one type is the in-game “commands” that are strongly related to the game mechanics, and the other type is the expression commands that express the player’s emotions. For example, the marking system in the game, players can use the mark to tell teammates the enemy’s location, share or ask for supplies from teammates without turning on the microphone. </p>

<p>Its manifestation in the game is: this communication method usually appears in two types of games, one is the interaction of expressions and behaviors of characters manipulated by players in MMO games (Massively Multiplayer Online), and the other is the online version of multiplayer games, where players pass information or emotions through behavior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7ff9e8d9-4dc1-4f36-ae14-964c716fdcf3.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Environment-Mediated-Communication"><a href="#Environment-Mediated-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Environment-Mediated Communication"></a>Environment-Mediated Communication</h3><p>Refers to the communication method that uses the environment as a medium and changes the environment as a way. It allows players to leave continuous changes in the game environment and communicate information by changing the environment.</p>
<p>Its manifestation in the game is: co-building buildings, signs, road signs, etc.</p>

Therefore, designers can try to reduce the cognitive load from the following two aspects to improve the efficiency of players’ non-verbal communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve the recognition of “commands”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take the commands in <em>Overcooked! 2</em> as an example. These commands are presented in the form of UI. Among the six icons, the four icons of faucet, knife, plate, and pot correspond to the four game states of the player in the game, namely cleaning, preparing, serving, and cooking. The visual performance of these four command icons is consistent with the logic of using these items in real life, and has strong recognition, which can quickly tell teammates what they are currently doing, and teammates can adjust what they want to do accordingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F23303806-886d-4757-8d38-984978fdd40e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Six expression commands and the animation effect of the garbled icon in “Overcooked! 2”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The icon of garbled characters is special. It expresses the player’s current irritable mood with interesting UI animation effects. It is the most realistic portrayal of the player’s mood when there is no time to cook in a time-critical situation. The icon design of this garbled code usually appears in animation or games. It is used here on the expression command, which allows players to quickly associate the emotions conveyed behind this icon and has high recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve the efficiency of players issuing “commands”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the game, not only the visual effect of the “command” itself will affect its use experience, if the player needs to remember too many non-verbal interaction methods, and the interaction efficiency is low, it will also reduce the game experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, designers can preset the expressions that players may use in the game and limit the number, and reduce the frequency of clicks and the steps that need to be remembered to achieve the interactive purpose as much as possible, so as to improve the efficiency of players from searching to issuing “commands”. For example, in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, players can quickly get the interactive actions they want to do to other players with only three clicks, taking into account the interactive relevance between social systems and facilitating immediate interaction between players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6c3b84fc-6e9f-4535-a31d-44dbd237f7f4.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>The steps for players to perform basic actions on other players in “Final Fantasy XIV”</em></p>

<h3 id="Provide-Release-Channels-In-Game-Character-Interaction-Design"><a href="#Provide-Release-Channels-In-Game-Character-Interaction-Design" class="headerlink" title="Provide Release Channels: In-Game Character Interaction Design"></a>Provide Release Channels: In-Game Character Interaction Design</h3><p>Games provide a relatively safe and controllable environment. In the game, players manipulate their own characters and can try behaviors that they dare not or cannot do in real life, and freely express inner emotions such as excitement, happiness, anger, and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Players communicate with each other through physical behaviors and expressions between characters in the game, which not only creates virtual interpersonal relationships and satisfies their own social needs, but also appropriately releases these emotions that cannot be released in reality. As a designer, when designing the communication experience of this part of character interaction, you can start from the following two directions to improve the efficiency of non-verbal communication between players in the game, so that its release role as a channel is better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design in conjunction with the game’s worldview</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, the behavior and expression design of the characters need to fit the game’s worldview itself. For example, the “lift-up” action in <em>Ollie &amp; Bollie: Outdoor Estate</em>. This set of actions is based on the attributes that the character controlled by the player is a small puppet and the limbs can be stretched to a certain extent. It is an action required by the gameplay. At the same time, the friendly action design itself is also in line with the game’s own settings and casual style. This two-player interactive action improves the player’s sense of immersion, and also accelerates the player’s understanding and use of the action. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa8e15ec4-4042-44ba-b9a9-83fd3caaafbd.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The two-player “lift-up” action in “Ollie &amp; Bollie: Outdoor Estate”</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stimulate players to expand interaction methods independently</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this basis, the behavior and expression design of the characters needs to be able to provide basic emotional expression, and also allow players to spontaneously expand interaction. For example, in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, in addition to providing players with actions to express basic emotions to other players, it also expands interaction methods for multiple participants such as hide-and-seek, long table magic, cloak magic, and shared spaces. The official provides some interactive actions, allowing players to interact spontaneously under the interaction rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fd398eba7-087c-4d2b-8d92-bb30cc42e280.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Sky: Children of the Light” use magic to interact in a “hide-and-seek” mini-game</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, designers can create some simple interactive actions without special meaning, making them a medium of narrative or communication, allowing players to give them rich and new meanings. For example, in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can also make different sounds by clicking on their own character with a short press or long press. The sound made by a short press is also often used by players to imitate the behavior of “talking” to strangers, and even to imitate interesting behaviors such as “quarreling” and “persuading” between friends. From a design perspective, increase the frequency of use of these character behaviors, let players interpret and use this behavior in their own way, and customize it as a special communication method between friends to meet the player’s own social needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fe9a7eb95-de21-452a-b9ae-e18eddd47a13.gif/size/"></p>

In the game, it is shown that players are allowed to leave continuous information in the game environment, which is a communication method based on the game mechanism that can modify the environment. It is also because of its special communication medium that the design of this communication method also relies on the designer’s use of the player’s mental model. The full use of mental models can minimize the player’s understanding cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental model: A model created by the brain based on what we have known and experienced. After the brain creates a model, it will react immediately without thinking when encountering a similar situation in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combination of mental model and game worldview</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the game <em>Death Stranding</em>, all players cannot appear in the game world at the same time, but they can refresh after a period of time and use the equipment and tools left by other players at a certain location. For example, ladders and ropes on cliffs, and even highways and bridges built by multiple players together, can also freely create signs or be reminded by signs created by others - reminding players of the nearby environment. The interactive design of these equipment, buildings, and markers makes full use of the player’s mental model of these common items in the real world. On this basis, combined with the game worldview, it reduces the player’s learning cost in the game, and allows players to quickly understand the way to use items in the game.</p>
<p>For example, the red BT mark (Beached Things: In the world view setting of <em>Death Stranding</em>, after a human dies, the body will turn into BT within 48 hours, and BT swallowing a living person will cause voidout. Players swallowed by BT will be sent to the Seam). This mark is first based on the meaning of “danger” represented by red in real life, and then the icon of BT is drawn on this basis. The combination of the two has a special meaning that conforms to the game world view - there are BTs ahead. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Sign creation panel in “Death Stranding”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Provide limited and friendly interactive entrances</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the above conditions, as a designer, you can also choose to provide a relatively limited and friendly interactive “entrance”. Relatively “friendly” interactive behaviors are not only the bridge between players and games, but also the bridge of emotional communication between players. The “limited” non-verbal communication gives players as few choices as possible due to the limitation of interaction channels, which improves the interaction efficiency of players.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Death Stranding</em>, players can give likes for help from other players, and can also receive likes from other players by creating buildings and signs that are helpful to other players. In this process, only the “like” interactive entrance is provided, and the “like” behavior itself is also kind, and this interactive experience creates a relatively friendly player communication environment. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Sam, the character played by the player in “Death Stranding”, gives likes to other players’ signs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can also share and display a video of their actions, speeches, piano playing, etc. to other players by using the “Memory Candle” magic item, and other players can also give likes through the “Memory Candle”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa2d75ab9-c6fe-4145-89a5-b0b6cd5a3330.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Sky: Children of the Light” watch the “memories” left by other players in the realm and give likes</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At this time, “like” is no longer just an interactive entrance, but exists as an “emotional connection point” between all helped players and creators.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Non-verbal communication design is becoming increasingly important in games today. Players manipulate characters to interact non-verbally in the game, which not only strengthens the sense of game immersion, but also strengthens the social attributes of the game and improves the game retention rate. Therefore, designers need to optimize the experience design of non-verbal communication between players from different aspects, improve the efficiency of non-verbal communication, and further ensure that players can get a more easy-to-use, efficient, interesting, and autonomously expandable immersive interactive experience.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167718.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we collect various items and unlock new information in games, we often use a system that is not so attractive to players, but is very important - the Bestiary system. Setting up a Bestiary system is one of the most direct ways to reflect the worldview of the entire game. It can carry various character settings, achievement information, item map data, and so on in each game.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the design of the Bestiary, introducing different game cases for analysis, aiming to explore some important commonalities and advantages in Bestiary design, in order to provide some ideas and references for Bestiary design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems"><a href="#1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems"></a>1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems</h2><p>The concept of “Bestiary (pictorial book)” originally refers to the creation of a general natural history book by drawing scientific illustrations of things in a certain field and adding corresponding explanatory texts. In many games, there are “bestiaries” with different or similar functionalities. In this case, it can be defined as “a collectible system that can collect, classify, display, and allow players to consult various item information obtained by players in various ways in the game.. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F451e98b5-0892-4f49-8984-3431946ba4e0.webp/size/" alt="《Pokémon Scarlet and Violet》 Pokédex"></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Bestiary system can present several main types according to their respective classification attributes. Here they are divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement Bestiary</strong>, which includes achievements, game endings, and CG collections, tending to collect certain results obtained by players;</li>
<li><strong>Collectible item Bestiary</strong>, such as weapons, costumes, recipes, plants, materials, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Text information Bestiary</strong>, such as some story background information, character information, and dialogue information obtained in puzzle games;</li>
<li><strong>Character Bestiary</strong>, including characters, creature settings, character information, display of unlocked new characters, and may be accompanied by other functions, such as a favorability system (such as in <em>Love and Sword</em> (Chinese Title: 遇见逆水寒), <em>Stardew Valley</em>);</li>
<li><strong>Other systems with Bestiary attributes</strong>, this type may not be a pure Bestiary collection interface, but it can bring players a similar experience, such as clothing and furniture decoration systems, card collection interfaces, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design"><a href="#2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design"></a>2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design</h2><p>Bestiary design involves one of the main gameplays: collection gameplay, and the Bestiary system is the most intuitive way to display the results of collection gameplay.</p>
<p>Adding collection elements to the game is an important way to enhance the player’s sense of accomplishment and prolong the player’s game retention time. Take open-world games as an example. In open-world games, if there are only main quests and side quests, more costs need to be invested in writing the storyline, which will consume more time and budget. Therefore, placing some collection elements as “seasoning” and “content filler” is a time-saving and labor-saving solution. It can directly increase the content of the game, guide players to explore the map, and add fun to the open-world experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F28aa85c7-1da0-4abe-8646-1dd7ef815488.webp/size/" alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey Map Collectible Markers"></p>
<p>In the book “The Overspent American”, Harvard University economist Juliet Schor proposed a new concept - the “Diderot Effect” or “matching effect”, which specifically refers to the phenomenon that people continue to configure items that match them after owning a new item to achieve psychological balance.</p>
<p>Therefore, many games use people’s “matching psychology” to stimulate players’ desire to collect, add matching designs, sets, and other concepts, and consider how to design the Bestiary system from the perspectives of player psychology and interactive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles"><a href="#Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles"></a>Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles</h3><p>When designing, collectibles can be classified and arranged according to different types of labels. Collected collectibles are displayed in order, and uncollected collectibles appear in a semi-transparent, gray silhouette, or other unlocked way. In addition to making the items more intuitive and orderly, this can also make it easier for players to see how many things they may be missing in the same type of Bestiary, arousing players’ desire to collect. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F33fefec6-4748-407a-98ea-153916164810.webp/size/" alt="Famine creates a character dressing interface"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”"><a href="#Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”" class="headerlink" title="Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”"></a>Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”</h3><p>In games, how to greatly increase the frequency of use of the Bestiary and make various interaction processes more convenient and concentrated? The answer is to use a functionally integrated approach. In addition to the most critical Bestiary function, let some Bestiaries carry other functions, such as placing level, combat skill display, and promotion UI; placing character skin and clothing collections, store, and other page jump UIs.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the hero display page clearly serves as a character Bestiary. In the interface, it can be seen that whether it is character information, combat strength attributes, and character skills, or related appearance changes and other functions, they are clearly and directly presented on the same interface. When players enter the character Bestiary, they mostly want to check other information related to the character. This is also a design method that conforms to the player’s interactive thinking. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F46d89aa8-d090-4205-8a91-7d0a92cc8f09.webp/size/" alt="Naraka: Bladepoint Hero Display Page"></p>
<p>At this time, the Bestiary system becomes an important part of the fully integrated game experience, rather than a dispensable independent interface. This Bestiary attribute system with comprehensive functions will become one of the key interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles"><a href="#Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles" class="headerlink" title="Add Path Guidance to Collectibles"></a>Add Path Guidance to Collectibles</h3><p>There are two schemes for the path guidance of collectibles: one is to prompt or tell the player where to obtain the collectible, including map information or limited-time event information; the other is that after the player collects the item, the information related to the collectible will also be unlocked. After that, when the player wants to collect this item again, they can directly check the location information in the Bestiary. In survival adventure games, farming management games, and card games, adding path guidance to the Bestiary is a very common and important design method. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa00bab7a-1275-44a9-8be5-a3853d92142c.webp/size/" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Bestiary Screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary"><a href="#3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary" class="headerlink" title="3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary"></a>3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary</h2><h3 id="Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces"><a href="#Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces"></a>Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces</h3><p>Many common Bestiaries are made by planar interface design methods. They can incorporate artistic and emotional understanding of the game background on the basis of concise and clear design. This design can make the Bestiary system not grab the attention of other interfaces. In other words, developers do not need this interface to be so attractive, but it must be harmoniously integrated into the game environment and maintain overall consistency with other interfaces of the same level.</p>
<p>For example, the construction and collection interfaces of <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> inherit the style of the game itself, using dark tones to set off the atmosphere, which is in line with the story background setting of the game; the UI size is prominent, and the distribution is simple and clear, and players can quickly find the items they want to click. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F3540e505-8c9f-41a7-8f5d-ace03a286dae.webp/size/" alt="*Cult of the Lamb*"></p>
<h3 id="Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion"><a href="#Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion"></a>Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion</h3><p>Most of the impressive Bestiary designs on the market, or the Bestiary systems in high-quality games in the hearts of players, have one thing in common, that is, they use the situational design of the game. The situational design of the Bestiary can be said to be centered on and aimed at highlighting and expressing the worldview, and is closely linked to the performance of the GUI. By packaging the interface in a way that conforms to and is embedded in the game background, players can have emotional resonance and recognition.</p>
<p>This kind of situational design can also be called scene-based design to some extent, because producers often use perspective scenes for specific performance. Generally speaking, its production process can be three-dimensional or two-dimensional, but from the perspective of the presentation results, their common feature is that the function of the Bestiary is placed in a three-dimensional scene. Among them, not only around the scene, but more emphasis on the sense of substitution, immersion, and atmosphere in the background of this worldview.</p>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a classic case of immersive situational Bestiary design. Its special feature is the use of a walk-in scene. A walk-in scene is a special category of scene-based Bestiaries. Players can operate characters to move and interact in the packaged Bestiary system, which generally appears in three-dimensional games. <em>Animal Crossing</em> cleverly packages the Bestiary into a museum that can be walked in. Players can display the collected items in the form of display and display. When players see that the fossil fragments collected on weekdays are spliced into complete fossils, and the aquarium and insect hall become colorful and vivid, they will feel that the time and energy they put into collection are very worthwhile. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F632955fc-a6db-47be-b0fa-2caea4fc6d9a.gif/size/" alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Museum Area"></p>
<p>Situational design can also be exemplified by Nintendo’s <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. In this game, players can use a vacuum cleaner to capture ghosts, and check the names and types of ghosts we captured in the doctor’s display room, and also see the different Bosses collected in the plot. In the interface, players can switch multiple glass sealed vessels left and right, which contain different collected ghosts.</p>
<p>Although the scene perspective is fixed and players cannot move, being able to manipulate the glowing glass jars that look like scientific laboratory glass jars still gives players a strong sense of atmosphere. The background setting and emotional response are well conveyed to the players through the scene. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0c31837c-540f-4de7-87df-318d4fdc94b3.gif/size/" alt="Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3 Ghost Bestiary"></p>
<h3 id="Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers"><a href="#Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers" class="headerlink" title="Reasonably Choose Special Carriers"></a>Reasonably Choose Special Carriers</h3><p>Special Bestiary carriers actually exist in both planar types and situational types. The reason why they are analyzed separately is that this is a way to make full use of the Bestiary to increase the game effect.</p>
<p><em>The Forest</em> is a first-person open-world survival game. The protagonist survives in the primitive jungle in a plane crash accident, and the Bestiary design inside is also very worthy of reference. The designer combines all the important information that players must consult, such as weapon and material production methods, and jungle creature records, into a “survival guide”. Through the form of this special carrier, supplemented by the immersive first-person browsing dynamics, it can give a good sense of substitution, which is very in line with the game setting and the interaction is very convenient. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F60266013-c838-474f-9878-e8ab9460de7b.gif/size/" alt="The Forest Production Bestiary &quot;Survival Guide&quot;"></p>
<h3 id="Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs"><a href="#Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs" class="headerlink" title="Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs"></a>Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs</h3><p>In addition, the interaction level and different positions of the Bestiary in the game also have different effects.</p>
<p>Some games will directly place part of the Bestiary system on the main interface of the initial entry into the game, at the same level as the “save and load”, “start game” and other UIs. This is so that players can quickly check their gains when starting and ending the game. It also shows that this type of Bestiary system can generally be slightly separated from the main content of the game, and players can consult the Bestiary after playing.</p>
<p>Many Bestiary systems, especially the functionally integrated Bestiary systems mentioned above, will mostly be set at the same level as “vbackpack”, “character status” and other functions, in a conspicuous place on the game interface or set as a pop-up interface for commonly used keys. At this time, the primary purpose is for players to be able to find and use them in a timely manner. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F40a3364b-f8f9-43ae-aac4-144b4d7ab9f4.webp/size/" alt="Terraria toolbar and other Bestiaries are in a conspicuous position"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>A good Bestiary system design can be guided by the game’s worldview, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game world and enhance the game experience. As one of the important systems in the game, the Bestiary system can not only provide strategic guidance and collection value, but also enrich the content of the game and increase playability through different types of Bestiary presentations.</p>
<p>All in all, in the process of game production, Bestiary system design is essential to create an attractive game world.</p>
