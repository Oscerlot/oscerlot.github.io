<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the rise of the metaverse, concepts such as virtual avatars and virtual social interaction have also become popular terms. In fact, avatars and virtual social interaction are not new concepts in games.</p>
<p>The word “avatar” comes from Sanskrit and means “a god appearing on earth in physical form.” In games, players are the “gods” who control the fate of their characters.</p>
<p>Thanks to the innate emotional talent of human beings, we can always easily “project” our physical and psychological conditions onto other things. The construction and identification of avatars in games are often a mapping of players’ self-awareness or desires. This strong personal characteristic is the basis for establishing social interactions and attracting others. Conversely, social interaction stems from players’ needs for emotion and belonging, and is an external manifestation of players’ higher-level psychological needs. Therefore, this mapping relationship will also have corresponding requirements for the design of the avatar. This article will explore the design possibilities of virtual avatars from the perspective of players’ psychological needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-Social-Interaction-Self-Empowerment-and-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification"></a>1. The Origin of Social Interaction: Self-Empowerment and Avatar Identification</h2><p>Game social interaction stems from players’ pursuit of a sense of identity and belonging. In order to meet this demand, the primary task is to enhance players’ empowerment and identification with their avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Self-empowerment:</strong> Believing that you have the power to control your own life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avatar identification:</strong> A psychological phenomenon in which an individual’s self-perception changes temporarily during the process of using and experiencing a game avatar, and the emotional and cognitive connection with the avatar is strengthened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization"><a href="#Ideal-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization"></a>Ideal Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Customization</h3><p><em>“An ideal avatar carries the player’s aesthetics, taste, and personal pursuits.”</em></p>
<p>Similar to social interaction in our real lives, our first impression of a person is often based on their physical characteristics, such as height, weight, skin color, hairstyle, etc., and then we further understand their identity, occupation, interests, and other aspects.</p>
<p>In games, how can players have the same emotional experience with virtual character images as in real social interactions, as opposed to ordinary NPCs? Sufficient identity recognition is essential. When the player’s identity characteristics are fully recognized, the player’s social window is truly opened. For example, the most basic: name, gender, identity, skills, dynamics, social relationship information, and so on. </p>

<hr>
<p>As shown in the figure above, we can divide the information that players give to virtual characters into four categories. Among them, basic information, characteristic information, and image design often give players the freedom to design themselves, encouraging players to create identity characteristics, and allowing players to gradually establish familiarity and ownership of the avatar.</p>
<p>In MMO games such as <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the first thing players perceive is the character creation system, which allows players to immediately immerse themselves in character design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5b75b6b4-e3a4-4dd8-bb45-e19358009b89.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Revelation Mobile character creation interface</em></p>

<p>Character customization is also a major gameplay element, but not all players have proficient character customization skills. Many games, in order to allow players to experience more fun in character customization, will refine the operation of character customization, enrich the styles of different face shapes and makeup, and ensure that the characters created by players can satisfy themselves. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has hundreds of character customization materials, allowing players to create their favorite styles and shapes as they wish. Some players even have great ideas and create many funny images. </p>

<hr>
<p>In addition, in the process of image design, surrounding elements such as environment and props can also be used to present personal interests and tastes, which not only enhances the personal attributes of the player’s character, but also provides a basis for the extensibility of design and the sustainability of social interaction in the game. </p>

<h3 id="Blank-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Imagination"><a href="#Blank-Avatar-Giving-Players-the-Freedom-of-Character-Imagination" class="headerlink" title="Blank Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Imagination"></a>Blank Avatar: Giving Players the Freedom of Character Imagination</h3><p><em>“Simple images make it easy for players to project their identities.”</em></p>
<p>Unlike ideal avatars, blank avatars prefer relatively symbolic characters. American cartoonist Scott McCloud put forward an interesting point in his book “Understanding Comics”: the fewer details a character has, the more likely the reader is to project himself into that character. When players combine a symbolic character with a meticulously described world, they can generate a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, the player’s avatar often appears in a minimalist form. The game enhances the player’s sense of immersion through the design of the environment and sound. The blank space of imagination and the atmosphere rendering of the environment—this strong contrast enhances the player’s self-empowerment and identification with the avatar, ignoring the difference between the “avatar character” and themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F932bfc50-03c1-4693-9ef5-eb051264604f.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fc4996b12-5580-4b98-8502-b00fcb2c4281.png/size/"></p>

The Process of Social Interaction: Self-Presentation and Group Identification"></a>2. The Process of Social Interaction: Self-Presentation and Group Identification</h2><h3 id="Frontstage-Self-Presentation"><a href="#Frontstage-Self-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Frontstage Self-Presentation"></a>Frontstage Self-Presentation</h3><p>“Frontstage” refers to the part of an individual’s performance that regularly defines the situation for the observer in a general and fixed way. The frontstage is where the avatar is concentrated, and it is the self-presentation where self-characteristics match character characteristics.</p>
<p>Players can present themselves through interactive designs in the game, enrich the character characteristics of the avatar, and attract the attention and recognition of other players.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-Interaction-Design"><a href="#Avatar-Interaction-Design" class="headerlink" title="Avatar Interaction Design"></a>Avatar Interaction Design</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Daily interaction:</strong> Give the avatar character traits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactive design and script design of the avatar itself, such as sound, dialogue, and actions, are important elements that help players achieve self-presentation during group interactions. In addition, real-time interactions such as text, likes, comments, voice, emoticons, and gifts can help players enrich their own character settings during social interactions, and enhance the fun and richness of social interactions.</p>
<p>The chat system of <em>Revelation Mobile</em> is similar to social software in real life. Players can use personalized chat methods and display their personality in real time through text, emoticons, voice and other chat tools, making the personality image of the avatar more vivid and three-dimensional. In addition, designs such as colored text and text shortcuts in the game make this chat tool more playable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Feead76b1-866b-404a-b3ae-49ecf3cb203b.jpg.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F5a6a2a81-af84-4c09-8cd0-dbdf9e924ffe.jpg/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest interaction:</strong> Show personal hobbies and specialties</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Revelation Mobile</em>, the player’s voice and various music-based gameplays are distinctive features that run throughout the game. This kind of interest interaction fully demonstrates the player’s self-characteristics and integrates personal characteristics into the role, and also provides the possibility of expanding social scenarios. For example, the tea room is designed based on the players’ common interest in music. In addition to exploring the love of music, traditional culture, painting hobbies, etc. can also be integrated into the game to strengthen the interactive design of the avatar. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F7f648d3a-6ac1-49ca-9a36-07c47699cdae.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Music social interaction in “Revelation Mobile”</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action interaction:</strong> Cultivate avatar behavior habits</li>
</ul>
<p>Encouraging players to use the avatar’s actions to develop behavioral habits is also an important factor in the interaction between players. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, there are many tasks that require players to use emotional actions on NPCs, such as encouraging, comforting, and touching NPCs. This process will continue to strengthen the player’s positive emotions. Since there are many such tasks, players will naturally get used to putting commonly used emotional actions on the shortcut bar. In this way, the threshold for interacting with other players is also very low. After everyone finishes the dungeon and meets acquaintances in the wild, they will easily make a gesture to say hello, which is much more convenient than typing in the chat box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Ffc4cd597-9eb4-481e-af6c-b6bdc71f6794.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional interaction:</strong> Enhance the emotional characteristics of the avatar</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players help each other to present themselves step by step through cognition and emotional progression, and gradually deepen their connection with each other. For example, by lighting the candles of other players’ avatars, they will change from small gray people to a state with a special decoration—this is the first step in interacting with people; further, players can also give nicknames to other players to deepen their memory of each other, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F4decd25e-aa09-4cd7-bfc2-e1d15005c3a8.jpg/size/"></p>

<p><em>Diagram: Avatar images in different social states in “Sky: Children of the Light”</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification"><a href="#Group-Interaction-and-Group-Identification" class="headerlink" title="Group Interaction and Group Identification"></a>Group Interaction and Group Identification</h3><p>Group identification is the process of classifying people or things, emphasizing common destiny, common goals, common emotions, and the interdependence of group members. The construction of group identification is mainly completed in the process of intra-group and inter-group interactions.</p>
<p>The essence of game social interaction is to achieve the goal of group interaction and group identification through joint participation. In games, ultra-temporal connections provide a situational basis for players to participate together, without considering the distance of reality. Players generate emotions due to their common love, making members naturally form a psychological feeling of “being together” or “being one of us”. Group interaction and group identification require effective social scenarios, and different social scenarios and experiences will also have different requirements for the design of avatars.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar identity design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In games, social scenarios are created for players through task design, challenge design, reward design, and intimate interaction design.</p>
<p>In these group gameplays, in order to facilitate group interaction, more member identity designs and corresponding character assignments are needed, and there should be differentiated gameplay when players join the group. This can be achieved through daily gameplay. When a player joins a group, the administrator should immediately set an identity for him and inform him of the corresponding tasks he needs to do immediately. In this way, differentiation can be expanded through subdivision, the player’s interest chain can be built, and a reasonable scene for social interaction can be created. Games such as <em>Identity V</em>, Werewolf, and LARP (Live Action Role Playing) fully mobilize the players’ subjective initiative with such character identity settings. In some battle scenarios, the matching methods of top lane, middle lane, bottom lane, jungle, and support also strengthen the players’ interest chain and promote the division of labor and cooperation among players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fbd539c22-5e84-4441-8986-5c41049ae829.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Character profiles in “Identity V”</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar relationship setting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpersonal pattern of closeness and distance is called the “differential order pattern”. Like ripples spreading on the water surface, it extends from oneself, circle by circle, and divides closeness and distance according to the distance, as shown in the figure below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F774229e3-15a6-4162-abf7-911b0f3cde93.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the group interaction of the game, the relationship setting between avatars can expand more social scenarios. For example, the common relationship settings such as master and apprentice, husband and wife, and gang can trigger different gameplays. Through this relationship setting and gameplay design, players are stimulated to communicate and collaborate with strangers, creating emotional bonds. Players can experience the ambiguity and warmth with the opposite sex in the game, and the communication and cooperation between teams or other groups, so as to achieve the social goals of group interaction and group identification. The gameplay of companionship, bonding, marriage, master-apprentice, grudge, and sect in <em>Revelation</em> applies this relationship setting method. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F857faeae-44b2-4195-b23f-c12b6235e4ab.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Diagram: Master-apprentice list in “Revelation Mobile”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar display design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting personal business cards (equipment, titles, achievements, battle records, clearance progress, collection progress, etc.) in the display system is conducive to gaining the attention and recognition of others, satisfying the players’ desire to show off, and plays an important role in the establishment of social relationships. Designs such as likes, sending flowers, worship, and the display of top-ranked player models can not only increase the display effect, but also enhance the interaction between players.</p>
<p>Both <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> and <em>Revelation</em> have leaderboard display designs, which can increase users’ group attention and help and encourage users to obtain group identification. In <em>Revelation</em>, when players team up, they can also click on the character card to view detailed information and perform dynamic interactions such as “send gifts” and “step on”. Obtaining the attention of other players through the avatar display system is also one of the ways to gain a sense of identity. </p>

<h2 id="3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design"><a href="#3-Inspiration-from-the-Metaverse-for-Avatar-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design"></a>3. Inspiration from the Metaverse for Avatar Design</h2><p>The popular metaverse social interaction not only has the shadow of virtual social interaction, but also has the characteristics of physical social interaction. It uses technologies such as AR, VR, and XR to build a holographic virtual reality platform. The interaction between us and our friends is no longer just simple voice, text, pictures, and videos. We can also go shopping, watch concerts, and play games together. Everyone does not have to worry about time and space, but enjoy an immersive experience.</p>
<p>With the metaverse empowering the game industry, the terminal devices that carry games will also be iterated, and the game industry may enter an era of wearable devices with VR&#x2F;AR and other technologies as the core. The concept of the metaverse has spawned a large number of VR&#x2F;AR technology implementations. Users can enter virtual reality scenes by wearing VR helmets, AR glasses and other devices to achieve an immersive experience.</p>
<p>The high picture quality and strong physical interaction of VR scenes give more space for the design of virtual avatars. The 3Dization of the image, the smoothness of the action, the closer correspondence between the avatar and the real world, and even the multiple experiences of vision, hearing, and touch have more possibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the creation of virtual identities allows players to be deeply bonded with the game through digital assets, helping the game achieve breakthroughs in user retention. Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said that identity, as one of the eight characteristics of the metaverse, can be regarded as an evolved version of the online identity in current games, and can represent players in a more creative and realistic way through avatars and other methods. In the metaverse game world, the importance of in-game identity and customization options is increasingly prominent. Players will have permanent digital identities and personalized virtual images. Through social activities in the game with virtual identities, they can obtain matching digital assets or custom assets, such as virtual land, houses, works of art, and pets, to achieve an immersive experience similar to the real world.</p>
<p>The self-expression of virtual identity is not only the continuous expansion of personalized images. With the rise of the emerging concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), people will interact in the digital world with the same freedom and trust capabilities as in the real world. The avatar is no longer just a mapping of self-awareness, but is more likely to become one of the roles in real life.</p>

    <title>Is Falling in Love with Paper People Just a Daydream The Immersive Experience of Dating Sims</title>
    <url>/2022/08/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20220812_28584_1036883/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220812/28584_1036883.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the expansion of the female gaming market, female-oriented dating sims have also become a battleground for major manufacturers. However, judging from the data, although there are many newly launched female-oriented dating mobile games, their market performance has declined very quickly. Taking five female-oriented mobile games of the two-dimensional and mixed styles launched in 2021 as an example, compared with the first month’s revenue, the revenue in March 2022 decreased by an average of 85%. It can be seen that not all games have truly touched female players. To provide players with an immersive dating experience and break through the homogenization of the category, it is inseparable from the research on the psychology of female players in dating games.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#1-The-Psychological-Mechanism-Behind-the-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience"></a>1. The Psychological Mechanism Behind the Immersive Experience</h2><p>The main reason why dating games are so popular with players is that they create a highly immersive virtual world for players, where players are psychologically satisfied and unconsciously bring their fantasies and emotions from real life into the virtual game.</p>
<h3 id="Ideal-Self"><a href="#Ideal-Self" class="headerlink" title="Ideal Self"></a>Ideal Self</h3><p>In reality, we always have some dissatisfaction with ourselves. Sometimes we wish we could be more charming and successfully pursue the person we like; sometimes we wish we could be braver and say no to a black-hearted boss. The game world gives us such an opportunity to become our ideal self: you can become a popular figure in school, or you can firmly engage in the career you love.</p>
<p>For example, in the dating game <em>Starry☆Sky</em>, released in Japan years ago, the heroine Tsukiko Yahisa is set as the only girl in the school and serves as the secretary of the student council, and is sought after by many people. This slightly “Mary Sue” setting, although very different from real life, satisfies the player’s fantasy to a certain extent: good looks, loved by those around her, and also has the beautiful qualities of bravery and independence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F938ef26a-1e7f-42b6-ae5e-c7c12d0e3238.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Similar settings are also very common in domestic female-oriented dating games. In <em>For All Time</em>, the heroine is an excellent cartoonist who accidentally travels to the world of her own comics and adventures with familiar characters. During the game, the player obtains a new identity (cartoonist, etc.), and also develops a deeper understanding and identification with this identity as the story progresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F3aed829e-0443-4784-93ad-7c36906c808b.png/size/"></p>
<p>From a psychological point of view, self-identity is formed by the interaction between the individual and the real world. However, in dating games, players can easily switch between real life and the virtual world to improve their self-identity. At the same time, the identity experience given to players by the virtual world is often far from the real self, but closer to the ideal self. Players can find a shadow of themselves in the game, and they long to be this character and accomplish many things that cannot be done in real life. In terms of appearance, the characters in the game have ideal figures and beautiful faces; in terms of personality, the fantasy plot like a novel, and the character’s strength and independence in the face of difficulties, are all their projections of the ideal self, satisfying the player’s need for self-worth realization.</p>
<h3 id="Deep-Seated-Motivation"><a href="#Deep-Seated-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Deep-Seated Motivation"></a>Deep-Seated Motivation</h3><p>Strong emotional experience is an important reason for immersion. Browsing the Weibo comments of dating games, we can always see players loudly confessing, “Please marry me quickly, don’t make me beg you on my knees”, “Husband, how can I live without you”, this kind of emotional experience is actually strongly related to the player’s game motivation. </p>

<p>After conducting a questionnaire survey of 612 female-oriented game players and semi-structured interviews with 15 players, researchers found that for positive emotions, external motivation (game sound, picture, plot, color) has a greater impact than internal motivation (social interaction, entertainment, learning, etc.). Both motivations have a significant positive correlation with positive emotions. The stronger the motivation, the more obvious the player’s positive emotional experience of the game. In contrast, for negative emotions, the stronger the external motivation, the lower the negative emotions; the stronger the internal motivation, the higher the negative emotions.</p>
<p>Specifically, if we see a player on the forum who is angry, anxious, and frustrated because of a female-oriented game, she is more likely to be an intrinsically motivated player who prefers to gain knowledge, relieve stress, make friends, and enjoy the pleasure of completing achievements through the game. And if it is a player who feels happy and satisfied in the game, then he may be driven by both internal and external motivations. He not only likes to gain knowledge and relieve stress through the game, but also appreciates the game’s graphics, art, music and other designs. </p>

<p>Therefore, it is also worth paying attention to by industry professionals to better awaken players’ motivation to play during the operation stage.</p>
<h3 id="Flow-Theory"><a href="#Flow-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Flow Theory"></a>Flow Theory</h3><p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as a feeling of total engagement in an activity. Flow is often accompanied by high excitement and fulfillment. Activities that produce a flow state often have the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Activities we tend to engage in</li>
<li>Activities we will focus on</li>
<li>Activities with clear goals</li>
<li>Activities with immediate feedback</li>
<li>We have a sense of control over this activity</li>
<li>Our worries disappear when engaging in the activity</li>
<li>Subjective sense of time changes - for example, you can engage in a long time without feeling the passage of tim.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F25174532-0794-4b05-9c5e-a3048d6f864d.png/size/"></p>
<p>In dating games, players often feel the passage of time without noticing it because they appreciate the handsome cards and charming voices of NPCs. This state is the flow state in psychology.</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding the conditions for the generation of the flow state, designing the game accordingly, and enabling players to achieve the flow state in the game is also an important step in creating an immersive experience.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience"><a href="#2-How-Do-Female-Oriented-Dating-Games-Build-an-Immersive-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?"></a>2. How Do Female-Oriented Dating Games Build an Immersive Experience?</h2><p>So, after understanding the player’s psychological mechanism, how should game developers build this immersive experience?</p>
<h3 id="Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth"><a href="#Focus-on-Player-Self-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Focus on Player Self-Worth"></a>Focus on Player Self-Worth</h3><p>Aggregate and analyze big data before game production, and put game settings that meet the psychological needs of modern women into the game, for example, players can independently choose “dating objects” and will also have a unique identity to realize self-worth. During the game, players invisibly feel the cultural content it contains - women’s freedom of marriage, economic independence, etc.</p>
<p>Such female-oriented games act as disseminators of feminist culture, returning the feminist ideas obtained from big data analysis to the target users, forming a cultural dissemination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F06a9466c-d703-4f11-bf88-e749be665415.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Awaken-Player-Motivation"><a href="#Awaken-Player-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Awaken Player Motivation"></a>Awaken Player Motivation</h3><p>In terms of awakening external motivation, excellent graphics and well-known voice acting teams are great bonuses. In addition, female-oriented games can focus more on male NPCs in the setting of scenes. Even if there are scenes where the heroine appears, the heroine is also popularized from the characteristics, so that more players can substitute themselves. This type of game also does its best to create this first-person perspective in the text, and rarely personalizes the heroine. Even in some games, the heroine has different personalities when facing different male NPCs.</p>
<p>Such an “unconscious” shaping of female characters makes the same plot a unique personal “experience” for the player, that is, through the different psychological experiences of the player, the game becomes personalized and customized. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F513188f3-5fc7-48a4-9f11-9bed16508803.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to awakening external motivation, designers can also start from awakening internal motivation to make female users feel “empathy”. For example, in <em>For All Time</em>, players can interact with NPCs using virtual messages. In addition, sending emojis, making phone calls, dating, and other behaviors add a strong “sense of reality” to the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2F4b069842-17f0-4062-9562-b648f065947b.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Create-a-Flow-State"><a href="#Create-a-Flow-State" class="headerlink" title="Create a Flow State"></a>Create a Flow State</h3><p>For players to truly enjoy the game, they need to fully substitute themselves into the game characters and participate in the game. When they are fully immersed in it, they will temporarily forget the current time and space and enter the world presented by the game, that is, reach a flow state. In dating games, some clever designs can also help create a flow experience:</p>
<p>In terms of goal setting, improve the player’s clarity of goals and control over the game. For example, the illustration system can help players clearly understand what their goals are and how many achievements they have achieved now. Ungained card sets can also prompt players what else they can do to better achieve their goals and improve their sense of control over the game.</p>
<p>In terms of emotional design, dialogue and voice acting are used to assist in the shaping of characters and the experience of the plot. For example, voice acting is not only reflected in the dialogue in the plot, but also used in various aspects of the player experience, such as the New Year greetings on the login interface, the statements around the birthday theme on the event interface, etc., incorporating emotions into the peripheral systems, making the immersive experience more integrated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220812%2Fce3ebeec-13ba-4045-8264-41ba5eb336a0.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In general, there are still infinite possibilities for the research on the immersion of female-oriented games: VR technology makes lovers within reach; the metaverse completely connects the real world and the online world; high technology may allow players to truly embrace “paper people” in the future. Gradually upgrading the immersive experience is also the common expectation of players and designers.</p>

    <title>May We All Be Blessed With Longevity, And Share The Beauty of the Moon Though Thousands of Miles Apart The Happy Ending in Games</title>
    <url>/2022/09/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20220913_28584_1042133/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220913/28584_1042133.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the Mid-Autumn Festival again, one of China’s four traditional festivals, and it also represents reunion. Throughout history, people have often used the “waxing and waning of the moon” to contrast “joys and sorrows, partings and reunions.” Su Shi’s “Prelude to Water Melody” uses the line “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” to give the Mid-Autumn Festival a unique romance and the theme of expecting reunion.  Even today, the main folk activities of the Mid-Autumn Festival still revolve around the theme of “reunion.” What does a happy ending look like in games? And why do players always crave a happy ending?</p>
<h2 id="1-Happy-Ending-HE-or-Bad-Ending-BE"><a href="#1-Happy-Ending-HE-or-Bad-Ending-BE" class="headerlink" title="1. Happy Ending (HE) or Bad Ending (BE)?"></a>1. Happy Ending (HE) or Bad Ending (BE)?</h2><p>When we browse Weibo (Chinese Twitter), we can always see many trending topics about popular dramas, usually in the format of “#XXX reveals that the ending of XX is HE#.” The ending of every popular film and television work triggers huge discussions, and it seems that the audience’s demand for HE (Happy Ending) is becoming stronger and stronger. When “Love Between Fairy and Devil” was broadcast, many fans were very concerned about whether “Dongfang Qingcang” and “Little Orchid” could have an HE, and they were relieved only after seeing the two together in the finale.</p>
<p>Although the terms HE and BE that we see now often appear in film and television dramas, these abbreviations actually originated from the gaming circle, especially in AVG games with multiple endings and multiple branches. However, many 3A masterpieces now also provide different plot choices. For example, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, different feedback from each dialogue of the protagonist will open different branch plots, which in turn will affect different endings. Of course, interactive movie games are more typical. For example, in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, the ending of the story depends entirely on the player’s choices, and there are countless branch plots in the middle. It is difficult for players to repeatedly play the same ending, which also dilutes the concept of HE and BE. Now it is difficult to define the different endings of a game with the traditional binary opposition definition, just like “Tian Long Ba Bu” (Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils), where “everyone is wronged, and all who are affectionate are sinful.” The labels of HE&#x2F;BE are now difficult to use to summarize the ending of a game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fc44dfd52-588d-4aad-8591-58a1cefc025f.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>AVG games are still sought after by many players</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the more ancient and once-popular text adventure games, HE and BE were still hot topics that players would always pay attention to. Even in addition to HE and BE, text adventure game enthusiasts would also discuss TE (True End) and NE (Normal End), but at present, these two labels are obviously only applicable to the game field. TE is the so-called “true ending,” which is a real ending that players believe is superior to other endings. It often requires players to complete all other endings before they have the opportunity to unlock TE, and other endings will automatically “degenerate” to NE.</p>
<p>As an extension of text, in the field of online literature, HB&#x2F;BE even directly form a label-based screening process. If it is BE, there will be a “risk warning” before reading. Of course, readers can also filter it out in advance, so that they can read it clearly.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Happy-Endings-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?"></a>2. What are the Happy Endings in Games?</h2><p>Returning to the topic of games, although multiple endings have now become the choice of many games, most mainstream games still have linear plots, and it is not difficult to list the happy endings in games.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>It Takes Two</em> is not complicated.  It roughly goes: “In the game, the little girl hears that her parents have decided to divorce, and she is heartbroken and prays to Dr. Hakim that they will not separate. With the help of the doctor and his guidance, the souls of the parents are transferred to two dolls, and they reluctantly begin an adventure in the magical world, trying to return to their original bodies. The two experience various hardships and dangers together, and after taking four lessons from Dr. Hakim, they gradually find their original sincere feelings and decide not to separate. So the spell is broken, and the family of three lives happily ever after.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F2f5be6af-403e-4186-8ef6-fa2d121e1741.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Mending a broken mirror is the biggest theme of the plot of “It Takes Two”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another masterpiece ported to PC, <em>Days Gone</em>, tells a story in the apocalypse. Facing the zombie siege, the protagonist and his brother and girlfriend, the three of them flee together. The girlfriend and brother are seriously injured, and the rescue helicopter that is about to take off cannot carry three people. In the end, the protagonist and his brother choose to stay, and the girlfriend successfully boards the rescue helicopter.</p>
<p>After the two escaped, they found the medical camp where the helicopter landed, but found that it had already been looted by zombies. Although they did not find the girlfriend’s body, the protagonist desperately believed that she had passed away, and felt self-blame and regret for it. Until one day, he accidentally discovered the possibility of his girlfriend’s miraculous survival, and then drove north, going through all kinds of hardships, and finally reunited with his girlfriend. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb5369fcc-0fe1-493a-849a-587e1a3175b2.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p>*The protagonist is very sure that his girlfriend is dead and has erected a monument for her. </p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F1e04c492-f2dc-478b-b14d-518c9248a66b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The protagonist reunites with his girlfriend at the end</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The reason for giving examples of these two games, in addition to their happy endings, is another characteristic, that is, they have all experienced the plot of “loss and recovery,” experiencing ups and downs, rather than being smooth from beginning to end. Such a plot setting often gives players a more gratifying feeling and releases more positive signals.</p>
<p>A psychological counseling supervisor once mentioned that when members of a mutual aid group shared their experiences of loss and recovery, some positive signals were often released along with them. For example, a member found a wallet that had been lost a long time ago in an unexpected place before participating in the group activity, so he suddenly said during the sharing that he felt he had the energy to clean up the house, and everything was developing in a good direction. This is a phenomenon of synchronicity in analytical psychology. When something happens internally, the external world also presents similar signals to us in some way.</p>
<h2 id="3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending"><a href="#3-Why-Do-Players-Also-Want-a-Happy-Ending" class="headerlink" title="3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?"></a>3. Why Do Players Also Want a Happy Ending?</h2><p>In fact, the title reveals everything. “May we all be blessed with longevity, and share the beauty of the moon though thousands of miles apart” is preceded by “People have joys and sorrows, partings and reunions; the moon waxes and wanes, is bright or dim: these things have always been this way since time immemorial (人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全 - rén yǒu bēi huān lí hé, yuè yǒu yīn qíng yuán quē, cǐ shì gǔ nán quán)”.  Games, like movies, are immersive experiences. Players will put themselves into the role and have empathy.</p>
<p>You can try to recall the Spring Festival of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly in an unimaginable way, and you and I around you, and even the entire society, experienced a huge psychological shock. Seeing various negative emotions on the Internet, many people will have a feeling of discomfort, which we call “empathic exhaustion.”</p>
<p>An excellent game can create a traversal game space with high degrees of freedom and more options, providing players with a very in-depth interactive experience from the structure and mechanism. But what really attracts players to continue playing is the story that integrates traversal selection and interactive narrative techniques, as well as the story content that players personally participate in telling. In the immersive plot of about 10-20 hours, we experience everything that the game characters experience. If we are really allowed to repeatedly lose one partner after another, and repeat one BE after another, we will be in a state of intense mental fatigue: once we start to walk into the pain of others, it is difficult to stop continuing to feel the pain, and it is also difficult to get out of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fc3ba16d7-bb91-40be-86fe-637b7b9f4975.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The author’s mental state was also affected by empathy when experiencing “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From a social perspective, in fact, many people in real life are engaged in “professional helping” industries, such as doctors, psychological counselors, etc. They often need to undergo very professional related training before they can be licensed to work. For example, psychological counselors need to follow supervisors to handle a large number of cases, and colleagues also need to discuss regularly with each other to avoid empathic exhaustion caused by trying to establish emotional connections with patients. And with the deepening of medical training, in many cases, their ability to empathize with patients will decrease, and even empathy钝化 (dùnhuà, blunting) will occur. Research also shows that compared with practitioners in the music, science, and finance industries, professional helpers are more likely to have substance abuse problems, which means… they also collapse.</p>
<p>But players will not undergo any professional training. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Abby’s use of a golf club to torture and kill Joel made many players feel quite uncomfortable. In the previous work, players spent a lot of time feeling and believing in two pitiful people who lost their families. Even if there is no blood relationship between the two, they can support each other like a real father and daughter, fighting against the entire wasteland world. But in the sequel, Joel is brutally killed, and even many people are unbelievable when they play this plot. Unlike the general film and television drama bridges where the protagonist is shot or falls off a cliff and there is still a chance, Joel, who was hit multiple times on the head with a golf club, is completely offline and cannot be saved. Many players also said that no matter which perspective they substitute, this ending is ultimately difficult to accept.</p>
<p>After a huge disaster, we can easily distinguish who are firefighters and police officers from the crowd - because they are the only ones who rush to the scene when everyone else is staying away from the disaster scene. But as players of ordinary characters, we just want to stay away from the traumatic experience scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F3419396a-18de-4ad0-88aa-cdf283102176.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The duo in Part 1 experienced life and death in Part 2</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So, rather than saying why we want to see a happy ending, it’s better to say that players don’t want to see others suffering during a long period of immersion. To put it simply, players don’t want to be sad, players don’t want to be upset. Social psychology has learned a beautiful world expectation, which roughly means that in order to give the whole world a sense of meaning, people tend to believe that the world is beautiful. That being the case, why embrace a miserable world?</p>

    <title>Capturing the Myriad Thoughts of Players - Designing with Emotion</title>
    <url>/2022/09/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20220913_28584_1042134/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220913/28584_1042134.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Video games are called interactive art. Players need to integrate themselves into the game world to savor the scenes created by the developers and the stories they write. However, it is not easy to allow players to smoothly solve the puzzles set by the developers without them realizing that they are being restricted by the game’s guidance.</p>
<p>To achieve this, it is first necessary to clarify “what kind of experience” you want to give the players. Only by guiding the direction with this can you accurately create or combine mechanisms that better express the essence of the work. However, “gameplay”, “mechanisms”, and “systems” all these game elements will eventually be mapped to the player’s emotional experience, which is why game experience design starts with emotional experience.</p>
<p>People may forget what someone said, but they will never forget how someone made them feel. Therefore, mobilizing emotions will naturally make people remember that feeling. This is the importance of emotional experience, as the saying goes, “sentimentality” is human nature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb6edf132-623b-4a29-9dad-6b662fe16090.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Speaking of this, I’m sure everyone will have doubts: then why don’t players choose the smooth and linear enjoyment of movies, but instead spend energy to challenge and even be a little self-abusive in games? This is precisely because games can bring players unique emotional experiences: a sense of choice, freedom, responsibility, and achievement, etc. These experiences are difficult to obtain through movies or other means.</p>
<h2 id="1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings"><a href="#1-Emotions-Give-Rise-to-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings"></a>1. Emotions Give Rise to Feelings</h2><p>Before discussing how to influence players’ emotional experience through design, we need to distinguish between two concepts: emotion and feeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> It is the short-term, instinctive, and impulsive feeling that the player produces. For example, sudden scares in horror games, the surprise of getting a good draw in gacha games, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Feeling:</strong> It is a social, advanced, delicate, and lasting feeling, which is a summary and sublimation based on emotions. For example, you will cry because of the departure of a character in the game, and you will be shocked by the ending of the game for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of individual psychological development, emotions appear earlier, while feelings appear later. Emotions are situational and temporary; feelings are profound and stable. After understanding the concepts of the two, we find that changes in players’ emotions can influence and give rise to different feelings, thereby affecting subsequent experiences and feelings. So how to make reasonable use of players’ emotions has become an important part of emotional experience design.</p>
<h2 id="2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions"><a href="#2-Factors-Affecting-Players’-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions"></a>2. Factors Affecting Players’ Emotions</h2><p>The process in which you perceive various influencing factors in the game and trigger emotional fermentation in your heart is the emotional experience, and this process is also constantly affected by “interaction”. The main factors that affect players’ emotions in the game include the following aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Frequency"><a href="#Interaction-Frequency" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Frequency"></a>Interaction Frequency</h3><p>Generally speaking, the higher the frequency of interaction, the more intense the player’s emotions. For example, in a shooting game, players need to simultaneously hold down the keyboard to adjust the position, move the mouse to control the direction, and click the mouse to aim and shoot. The interaction frequency required in the game is very high, and the player’s emotions are prone to be in a more excited and nervous state. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fe41cb8a5-18cf-478d-b237-67a00711661b.gif/size/"></p>
<p>In some puzzle games, it is often necessary to reduce the interaction frequency so that players can switch from tense emotions to relaxed emotions that are conducive to thinking, and reduce the interference and interruption of players’ thoughts with less present interaction methods.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction-Feedback"><a href="#Interaction-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Interaction Feedback"></a>Interaction Feedback</h3><p>Interaction feedback refers to the perceptual feedback that players instantly obtain after performing interactive operations. Feedback is an important part of the interaction process. Only when players receive obvious and sufficient multi-dimensional feedback will they think that the current interaction is meaningful, and the emotions triggered by the interaction will be more real. Conversely, if you don’t want players to perform a certain interactive behavior, just don’t give them any feedback. For example, in a shooting game, if the designer does not allow players to harm their teammates, players will not receive any feedback when they hit their teammates in battle.</p>
<h3 id="Real-time-Performance"><a href="#Real-time-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Real-time Performance"></a>Real-time Performance</h3><p>Real-time performance refers to the visual, auditory, tactile, and other information that players obtain in real time during the game, regardless of whether they interact or not. They can all bring various emotional experiences to players in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In visual performance, different colors (red feels passionate, blue feels calm), different shapes (circles feel gentle, spikes feel dangerous), different shots (looking up feels oppressive, shaking feels uneasy), etc. will make players have different emotions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In auditory performance, different rhythms, instruments, pitches, etc. will also bring different emotions to players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In tactile performance, the maximum level of tactile performance we can achieve so far is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller.</p>

<h3 id="Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation"><a href="#Create-Short-term-Emotional-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation"></a>Create Short-term Emotional Stimulation</h3><p>To mobilize players’ tension in competitive and action games, a moment is usually created - in this moment, players must complete complex operations accurately and without error to win. For example, dodging and parrying when players fight bosses in the <em>God of War</em> series; players in <em>Dota</em> reverse the situation and win the victory through perfect cooperation with teammates. In these moments, the player’s tension is constantly stimulated, and the emotions are pulled to the highest point and then released like a floodgate at the moment of victory. This pleasure of emotional release is “addictive”. </p>

<p>Tension can be used, and other emotions can also be used. For example, in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, under the guidance of the plot, players, as members of Task Force 141, fight side by side with their teammates in order to complete the mission of their trusted superior, Shepherd. The repeated battles side by side deepen the friendship between the players and their teammates. In the conversations and work with the teammates, players will recognize the unique personality of each teammate, which deepens the players’ cognitive depth of the NPCs.</p>
<p>But in the later missions, the commander of Task Force 141, Shepherd, betrayed them and mercilessly killed or indirectly harmed the team members. All these changes will make players feel shocked, unbelievable, angry, sad, and broken down. The hatred for Commander Shepherd is high. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>The unfortunate “Ghost” and “Roach” are thrown into a pit and burned together.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is this plot that makes players remember the character “Ghost” who is not the protagonist. Even today, six years later, there are still a large number of players who feel sorry for the character “Ghost”, and its related peripheral products are in short supply.</p>
<h3 id="Drive-Emotions-with-Choices"><a href="#Drive-Emotions-with-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Drive Emotions with Choices"></a>Drive Emotions with Choices</h3><p>The above examples all use the simple and strong stimulation of players to generate rapid emotional fluctuations. However, sometimes we want some practices that are slower to take effect but have a longer-lasting impact. At this time, we can try to impact the players’ self-awareness to generate emotional fluctuations. There is a theory in psychology called self-discrepancy theory, which divides everyone’s cognition of themselves into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual self:</strong> Objective and true evaluation of oneself</li>
<li><strong>Ought self:</strong> Feeling that you should do those things, this is your obligation (such as calling 119 when you see a fire)</li>
<li><strong>Ideal self:</strong> What you would do in your ideal self (such as doing charity)</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a gap between the actual self and the ought self, you will feel that you have not fulfilled your responsibilities and obligations, and then you will have emotions such as guilt and shame. The most classic example is the “moral dilemma”. Taking <em>The Witcher 3</em> as an example, in the game, facing a woman who is heartbroken by the loss of her child, orphans who are suffering from hunger and cold, innocent villagers, and a wealthy but childless baron, no matter how the player chooses, they cannot save everyone. At this time, the player will inevitably feel the gap between the actual self and the ought self, and then generate the above emotions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F0425ab60-ce7a-4430-bc61-dd5c697a844b.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The classic Bloody Baron quest in “The Witcher 3”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Another classic case is <em>This War of Mine</em>. There is no difficulty option in this game. The difficulty of clearing the game is more based on the player’s code of conduct. Players can choose the human mode: take in every defector, help everyone who asks for help, don’t take a needle or thread from the masses… But the consequence of this is often to increase the difficulty of clearing the game, and eventually end in tragedy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Ff6ab6d9d-4ee6-4488-80a1-49acd68ca4c4.png/size/"></p>
<p>The lack of supplies throughout the game forces players to choose “violent” methods to solve problems. When players choose to abandon moral constraints and have the mentality of “it’s just a game” and “the game must be cleared”, the game also becomes “easy”. So you break into the mansion of the old couple and loot their supplies, because you are about to run out of food; you start to sneak attack other survivors in the ruins and take their weapons and bullets, because you need weapons to protect yourself; you will decisively abandon the injured companion, because the soldiers next door are about to find this place; you will keep the child who came to ask for medicine out of the door, because only these supplies are left. But in fact, making these decisions is not easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Febd12d6b-9526-4f82-930a-5b5d2994a575.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the face of such complex emotions, it is often difficult for people to make decisions. The reason why it is difficult is because people’s emotions are deeply touched and they experience the difficulty of choice. Therefore, designing complex emotional experiences, grasping the complex emotional factors in people’s hearts, and creating a difficult situation are very important in game design.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when there is a gap between the actual self and the ideal self, people tend to have emotions such as frustration and disappointment towards themselves. These emotions are usually not strong, because people often fail to reach their ideal self. After these emotions often appear, they will also begin to become numb.</p>
<p>So is the gap between the actual self and the ideal self not able to be used to generate strong emotions? Of course not, because conversely, once this gap is crossed and the ideal self is reached, people will feel great joy, satisfaction, and pride. These powerful and very positive emotions will also be addictive. “The bigger the gap crossed, the greater the emotional fluctuation”.</p>
<h3 id="Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion"><a href="#Sublimate-Experience-with-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Sublimate Experience with Emotion"></a>Sublimate Experience with Emotion</h3><p>So now the question is how to create this huge gap?</p>
<p>Self-sacrifice is a good way. Regarding self-sacrifice, the writer Somerset Maugham has a wonderful description in <em>The Razor’s Edge</em>: “Self-sacrifice is an overwhelming emotion. Even lust and hunger are insignificant compared to it. It makes people make the highest evaluation of their personality and drives people to destruction. It can be worthwhile, or it can be worthless. No wine is so intoxicating, no love is so destructive, and no sin is so irresistible. When sacrificing oneself, one instantly becomes greater than God.”</p>
<p>The most amazing game that incorporates “self-sacrifice” and allows players to complete the leap of the ideal self is <em>Nier: Automata</em>. In the ending of <em>Nier: Automata</em>, the task difficulty of the player fighting the production team is designed to be very large. But when the player is about to be shot down, they will see messages from all players in the world, encouraging you to persevere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2Fb7c86e61-363f-4145-97a3-7932d2f1351a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Then, you find that your plane is protected by 6 wingmen. Each plane is a player’s save file. Being shot down means that the save file is lost. In this process, you will feel the kindness from all over the world. So many players are willing to sacrifice their save files just to block a bullet for a stranger. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F58a1fe74-fba6-489c-98ab-a4531b40e9ea.png/size/"></p>
<p>After clearing the game, the game also gives players the opportunity to sacrifice themselves, but it is not a simple and direct option. This design is particularly clever. First, it allows players to leave messages, just like they were encouraged before, to encourage other players who are in a hard battle, immediately allowing players to complete the role transition from the helped to the helper. Then step by step, through a series of questions, the meaning of the player’s self-sacrifice is enhanced.</p>
<p>“Are you going to save the weak?” “Are you sure you want to use all your data to save someone you don’t know?” “That person may be someone you hate, are you still willing to do this?” “The chapters and functions you have worked so hard to unlock will also be unavailable, are you still willing to do this?” “In fact, you may not be thanked for doing this, you may be seen as hypocritical, are you still willing to do this?” Every time the player clicks [Yes], they reach an ideal self. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220913%2F4c65af59-145e-4d66-9d27-227eba7ac39a.png/size/"></p>
<p>This ending always controls the player’s emotions, appropriately uses the player’s “self-sacrifice” emotions, makes the player feel “participating in a great cause”, and thus generates a high evaluation of their own morality, reaching the “ideal self” in their heart, and completely deepening the experience of the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Designers create a real game world through various methods. The purpose of various gameplay, systems, and level settings is also to allow players to better immerse themselves in it, satisfy players’ various fantasies in real society, play the role of a hero to kill dragons, and play the role of a knight to save the world. Everything is to allow players to feel the beauty of the virtual world, gradually gain self-identification, emotional catharsis, and communication and resonance with others in the process of experiencing the game.</p>

    <title>Clocking In In The Virtual World Game Check-In System Experience Design</title>
    <url>/2022/09/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20220916_28584_1042734/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220916/28584_1042734.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When it comes to checking in, you must be familiar with it. From reporting to school as a child to clocking in at work now, checking in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. In games, we can often see this delightful and worrying check-in design.</p>
<p>We hope to get corresponding rewards through check-ins, but too many check-ins will make us feel bored. And check-ins do have a magical attraction for us. To exaggerate, as long as the “check-in” function is added, we will unconsciously check in to receive rewards. Nowadays, the “addictive” effect of check-ins has also prompted more games and mobile applications to add this function to their products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Ffb44828e-b915-4989-8afa-7197145bb36f.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Check-in Page in the Game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In game products, check-in means that the player has logged in to the game or participated in a certain activity. It refers to the player’s operation on the game interface at a specific time and conveys to the system that the product has been used. This method improves the user activity and retention rate of the game to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Nowadays, check-in activities have basically become a standard gameplay in every game, especially check-ins during special events or festivals, which play an important role in maintaining high player activity during the event. It is precisely because the check-in system in the game has a strong attraction to players, allowing players to obtain certain rewards after checking in, that makes players dependent on and “addicted” to check-ins.</p>
<p>Although check-ins will also bring an uncomfortable sense of restraint to some players, this sense of restraint is generally replaced by the pleasure of various rewards. Even if some players still cannot accept this method, it is undeniable that the design of the check-in function does have great appeal to players, while maintaining a high level of player activity in the game for a certain period of time, and even attracting some fans who are keen on checking in.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Design-a-Check-in-Function-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?"></a>1. Why Design a Check-in Function in Games?</h2><h3 id="Game-Perspective"><a href="#Game-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Game Perspective"></a>Game Perspective</h3><p>For game products, the design of the check-in function mainly serves to increase player activity, improve retention, attract new users, and promote revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Activity:</strong> Through the check-in function, the game allows players to log in to the game every day, increasing player activity in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> The check-in function allows players to form a habit of playing the game through this form, encouraging players to go online and receive rewards as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Attract New Users:</strong> Attracting new users means that players can share socially through check-in tasks, so that the number of players can be increased to a certain extent.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Revenue:</strong> Promoting revenue is to guide players to transform from non-paying players to paying players by differentiating rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Player-Perspective"><a href="#Player-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Player Perspective"></a>Player Perspective</h3><p>From the player’s perspective, the main purpose of players checking in is to obtain certain rewards. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, rewards are mainly divided into material and spiritual rewards.</p>
<p>First, players can get material rewards: that is, players can get game points, prizes, skins, props and a series of rewards that attract them to log in through check-ins. Second, players can get spiritual rewards: that is, the rewards obtained by players through check-ins make them emotionally satisfied (the need to be praised and recognized by others), and self-actualization (such as game rankings, achievement completion, obtaining medals, etc.).</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of whether it is from the game perspective or the player perspective, the check-in design meets the needs of both parties. It can not only meet the deep needs of players for material and spiritual rewards, but also bring high attention, activity and retention rates to the game. Therefore, the importance of designing check-in functions in products is self-evident.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players"><a href="#2-Why-Does-the-Game-Check-in-Design-Capture-the-Hearts-of-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?"></a>2. Why Does the Game Check-in Design Capture the Hearts of Players?</h2><p>After understanding what check-in is and why we should design check-in, we need to discuss why check-in design is so “magical” and makes players fall into the cycle of check-ins. We believe that two points are very important.</p>
<h3 id="Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol"><a href="#Check-in-Becomes-a-Super-Symbol" class="headerlink" title="Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol"></a>Check-in Becomes a Super Symbol</h3><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, check-in has been integrated into all aspects of our lives. It can be said that check-in has become a “super symbol” implanted in our brains. This forms that as long as it is any check-in design, players will unconsciously click to check in. Because they already have expectations for check-in in their minds, check-in will always have an attraction effect on players.</p>
<h3 id="Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in"><a href="#Psychological-Suggestion-of-Check-in" class="headerlink" title="Psychological Suggestion of Check-in"></a>Psychological Suggestion of Check-in</h3><p>Check-in behavior is generally considered to be continuous, so after players start checking in, they will tend to complete it continuously. And players have a clear understanding of check-in. If they complete the check-in, they will get rewards. If they continue to complete the check-in, they will get more rewards. This psychological suggestion will drive players to actively complete the check-in. The check-in function first deeply attracts players at the psychological level, and then through different check-in designs in the game, players are driven to complete the check-in by psychological inertia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F15ae2316-890d-4f65-998f-92bbc9ac8dde.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-a-Check-in-Function-that-Players-Will-Love" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?"></a>3. How to Design a Check-in Function that Players Will Love?</h2><p>Since check-in is so attractive to players, how should the check-in in the game be designed? In order to allow players to continue checking in for a long time and stay in the game, the “addiction” model can be incorporated.</p>
<p>The “addiction model” mainly includes four links: trigger, action, reward, and investment. Through the reward mechanism, it stimulates users to repeatedly start the game, cultivates players’ behavior habits, and makes players dependent on and惯性(guàn xìng - inertia) to the game; at the same time, the characteristic function design further improves the activity and retention of existing players in the game, allowing the check-in function to achieve a win-win situation for the game and players.</p>
<h3 id="Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance"><a href="#Trigger-Design-Player-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Trigger Design - Player Guidance"></a>Trigger Design - Player Guidance</h3><p>The game check-in has a guiding effect on players. When guiding players, it is necessary to use triggers to drive players to enter the “addiction” cycle of check-in in the game. Triggers can prompt players to take action and give them psychological hints before the player’s check-in behavior begins.</p>
<p>In the game, it is necessary to establish a more obvious check-in prompt to get the player’s attention and increase the exposure of check-in in the game. The commonly used prompt methods in the game are pop-up windows and non-modal reminders of icons. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, when players enter the game, a modal activity window will pop up to remind players of recent activities and activity check-ins. After entering the game, the icons on the right use bright light flashing to highlight the activities and check-in entrance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F3987c1ce-45ea-41f1-9c63-894670635bd0.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p>At the same time, on the left side of the game lobby, task guidance is used to allow players to view the tasks that can be completed every day and obtain corresponding rewards. The setting of simple tasks not only guides players to familiarize themselves with the gameplay, modes, etc. of the game, but also becomes an important auxiliary function for players to experience the game. At the same time, reducing the difficulty of tasks and the amount of stimulation for players, reducing the burden on players, encouraging players to experience the game, and obtaining corresponding rewards after completing tasks, all make the trigger effective and allow players to enter the next link of the “addiction” model. </p>

<h3 id="Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals"><a href="#Behavior-Design-Emotional-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Behavior Design - Emotional Goals"></a>Behavior Design - Emotional Goals</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Increase player motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A very important goal of check-in design is to influence player emotions and design player behavior. In the check-in process, it is necessary to provide players with a goal, so that players have expectations in their hearts, and hope that they can complete the goal at a certain stage. When players get closer and closer to this goal in the process, their actions will occur faster.</p>
<p>This effect of accelerating player actions through behavior design will have an impact on player emotions. When the player’s current goal is achieved, their motivation will be restored. Therefore, when the player completes the current stage goal, it is necessary to continue to set the next goal to stimulate the player’s emotional goal. In <em>My Dear Farm</em>, players can get a box of furniture by completing 7 days of check-in. In order to get special prizes, players will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the gift package, the rewards will gradually increase, thereby further increasing player motivation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fc09970fd-a8f5-4efa-8fc1-cecfe616d534.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《My Dear Farm》 Check-in Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the player’s check-in cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Another aspect of influencing player emotional goals is to reduce the player’s check-in cost. That is, when players face a large amount of information and choices, they will need more time to think, which will greatly increase the player’s burden and then reduce player emotions. Therefore, in the game, breaking down large goals into small goals that are achieved in stages will reduce the burden on players, increase players’ goal expectations, and enhance players’ phased sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the game divides the days of each month into a target cycle of 7 days (i.e., one week). Players will receive gold chips as a reward for accumulating 7 check-ins. In order to obtain this reward and exchange items in the game, everyone will insist on checking in, and the closer they are to the 7-day gift package, the better the gift rewards will be. This effectively stimulates the player’s interest, enhances their check-in motivation, and makes the probability of players breaking their check-in streak lower and lower. </p>

<h3 id="Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior"><a href="#Reward-Design-Strengthen-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior"></a>Reward Design - Strengthen Behavior</h3><p>Players obtain certain rewards through check-ins, which can enhance their check-in motivation. At the same time, the feedback of obtaining rewards reinforces this behavior. Check-in provides players with a new way to obtain game resources. Players only need to maintain loyalty to the game and perform simple check-in operations to obtain corresponding game resources. Of course, the design of rewards should also consider the gradual progress of the process, and it is necessary to meet the different needs of players according to different cycles.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s anniversary celebration interspersed different levels of rewards during the check-in period, fully mobilizing players’ emotions and making them unable to stop once they started checking in. At the same time, they can obtain advanced costumes for new characters during the check-in to guide and strengthen their willingness to experience new characters, and meet the needs of new and old players through other rewards. Even in some games, a complete set of equipment will be broken down into check-in rewards, so that players can continue to complete check-ins to collect the equipment. This method can also stimulate players’ collection needs. </p>

<h3 id="Investment-Design-Emotional-Resonance"><a href="#Investment-Design-Emotional-Resonance" class="headerlink" title="Investment Design - Emotional Resonance"></a>Investment Design - Emotional Resonance</h3><p>As the last link of the “addiction” model, the investment design makes players develop a habit for the game by generating emotional resonance with players. The more players invest in the game, the more they will value check-in. The game can start with investment design and mobilize players’ emotions. As the number of check-ins increases, the number of days players have checked in is displayed, and even a personalized check-in commemorative booklet can be customized for players, so that players have a different kind of emotion for the game.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>A Dream of Jianghu</em>, when a player reaches 666 days of check-in, the game thoughtfully prepares a personalized commemorative booklet for the player, visually displaying the player’s investment in the game. This design brings satisfaction and emotional resonance to the player’s emotional experience, and also makes the player unforgettable about the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F6f64a7c4-0690-4693-912b-6b244635ee70.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation"><a href="#Characteristic-Design-Theme-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation"></a>Characteristic Design - Theme Presentation</h3><p>In addition to the “addiction” model, attention should also be paid to the characteristic design of check-in. Common check-in activities are designed with regular check-in boards, but long-term presentation in this way will always give people a feeling of fatigue of looking at a calendar, which will cause players to have the burden of completing tasks. Therefore, breaking the conventional design can not only bring players a novel experience, but also highlight the theme of the game or the theme of new activities.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Onmyoji</em>, the design of its check-in interface is presented in the form of daily divination check-in, which is very consistent with the tonality of the game. The way of divination check-in also gives players a novel experience, driving players to unknowingly complete the check-in behavior during the divination process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F58baf0e2-e047-4efd-9284-c07273cb8ee4.png/size/"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the check-in interface of a certain period of activity in <em>Identity V</em>, players can check in by wiping the mirror, and they will also receive corresponding rewards after completing the check-in. In addition to the personalized design of the interface in combination with the game theme, the way of checking in by wiping the mirror is also very novel. At the same time, players will find that every time they wipe the mirror, the tasks in the mirror will change slightly, which hints at the development of the plot and makes players imaginative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fdcbd3439-cd1d-4b17-bbad-7fd7aa85b80e.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Identity V》 Event Check-in Page</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, if the check-in design wants to further attract players, make players develop the habit of logging in to the game every day, and complete the corresponding activity check-ins in the game to obtain rewards, it is necessary to guide players through trigger design, satisfy players’ emotional goals through behavior design, strengthen player behavior through reward design, and arouse player emotional resonance through investment design. And present novel themes with characteristic designs to improve event data.</p>
<p>Although too many check-in designs will make some players feel bored, a good check-in design will definitely not make players feel burdened. As long as the check-in design is integrated with the game and presented in various forms, everything can be used for check-in. If it can make players think of the game unconsciously and develop the habit of opening the game unconsciously, it should be a check-in that players will never forget and love, and it is also a great game that amazes players!</p>

    <title>Seeing is Not Necessarily Believing Optical Illusion Games</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20220916/28584_1042741.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The famous printmaker M.C. Escher’s painting “Waterfall” depicts a building that can make a water wheel run forever by relying on a “circulating waterfall.” At first glance, the viewer will feel that the waterfall in the painting is flowing, but upon closer inspection, it will be found that the waterfall in the picture will flow down continuously, but the falling water will flow upstream. This is an optical illusion picture that can be reasonably depicted in two-dimensional space, but cannot actually appear in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1321b0d6-56b4-4ab6-ada8-8c4bfba4d929.jpg/size/" alt="Escher&#39;s famous painting &quot;Waterfall&quot;"></p>
<p>Optical illusions make the viewer’s visual experience contradict normal reasoning, breaking the stereotype of human binary thinking and allowing the viewer’s imagination to break through the boundaries of natural physical laws. In recent years, optical illusion games have captured many players with their unique visual illusions and endless imagination.</p>
<p>In this article, we will mainly introduce three types of visual illusions: impossible spaces, perspective illusions, and Gestalt illusions, and analyze the reasons why optical illusion games attract players.</p>
<h2 id="1-Impossible-Spaces"><a href="#1-Impossible-Spaces" class="headerlink" title="1. Impossible Spaces"></a>1. Impossible Spaces</h2><p>The formation of impossible space utilizes the conversion and alternation of viewpoints, showing three-dimensional forms on a two-dimensional plane, but presenting ambiguous visual effects in the three-dimensional form, causing confusion in space.</p>
<p>The Penrose triangle is a typical impossible figure based on impossible space. It looks like a cube, composed of three cuboids with rectangular cross-sections. The three cuboids form a triangle, but the angle between two cuboids seems to be a right angle. The above properties can be drawn in a two-dimensional plane, but cannot be realized on any normal three-dimensional object. The painting “Waterfall” is precisely through the splicing of two Penrose triangles, making players have the illusion that the waterfall is flowing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F281fcf06-a82e-4b71-abba-bdbe71411201.jpg/size/" alt="Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>The game <em>Monument Valley</em> uses a large number of Penrose triangles as the game screen. The protagonist, IDA, shuttles through the impossible graphic space. Players only need to move or rotate the pillars in a certain order to reconstruct a feasible space and achieve the conditions for safe passage. As shown below, in this level, players need to overcome the three-dimensional illusion generated in the two-dimensional plane, help the protagonist of the game pass through the Penrose triangle corridor and reach another door. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F213753d3-ad61-4982-a425-ce317a9a39a6.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Penrose Triangle"></p>
<p>In addition, the well-known Möbius strip is also an optical illusion phenomenon based on impossible space. A Möbius strip is a paper strip formed by twisting a piece of paper 180 degrees and then gluing the two ends together. If an ant is placed on this ring, it can walk from the front to the back without crossing the boundary, and keep going, giving the viewer an illusion of infinite loop. Although the Möbius strip exists in the three-dimensional world, it only has the characteristics of two-dimensional space. It has only one single-sided surface, rather than two sides in three-dimensional space. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F5fa6cb5e-4eb4-42dd-8ce5-c4006278e61a.png/size/" alt="Möbius Strip"></p>
<p>The buildings in the game <em>Monument Valley</em> also draw on the Möbius strip. The protagonist IDA can change from standing vertically to standing horizontally through the twisted corridor, that is, gravity has changed, which is an impossible picture in three-dimensional real life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F0154d8f3-3c14-467e-a82f-98c6dee561be.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Möbius Strip"></p>
<h2 id="2-Perspective-Illusions"><a href="#2-Perspective-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="2. Perspective Illusions"></a>2. Perspective Illusions</h2><p>Perspective means that two objects of the same size appear larger when they are closer to the person and smaller when they are farther away. Generally, parallel projection is used in games. In parallel projection, even if the distance of the object changes, the size of the image will not change; but in perspective projection, the distance will affect the size of the image. As shown below, these are two yellow lines of the same length, but the human brain will judge its size according to the environment in which the object is located, and think that the yellow line in the distance is longer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F856c2e2b-fcec-4b22-aabe-88d41d7166f8.png/size/" alt="Perspective Illusion"></p>
<p><em>Superliminal</em> uses the relationship between perspective depth and reference objects as the two core elements of the game. Players must change their perspective and think unconventionally in order to wake up from their dreams. As a basic gameplay, players need to pick up specific props in the environment, change the reference objects, and use the most direct perspective relationship to enlarge or reduce objects, so as to adjust specific props to the appropriate size and achieve the conditions for passing the level. For example, players can use the depth relationship between the cheese and the corridor to enlarge the cheese slice and make it a slope to jump over the hole in the ground. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F1535552e-31f8-4b99-955b-46e6198b6cfa.png/size/" alt="Superliminal Cheese"></p>
<p>In the puzzle adventure game <em>Perspective</em>, perspective illusion is the main way to solve puzzles and explore the game world. Players can rotate the camera angle and use visual errors to create visual distance changes between platforms that are originally far apart, creating a path that does not exist to achieve the conditions for passing the level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F7e9803f9-96f6-4565-9367-0f86fc5c71b7.png/size/" alt="Perspective Game"></p>
<h2 id="3-Gestalt-Illusions"><a href="#3-Gestalt-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestalt Illusions"></a>3. Gestalt Illusions</h2><p>When people’s visual center focuses on a complex figure, the human brain will judge the object in front of it according to the familiar shapes or contours stored in memory. After obtaining relevant prompts, people’s visual experience will automatically complete the rest of the incomplete contours in the image. This is what is called Gestalt illusion in psychology. For example, in the figure below, the viewer seems to be able to automatically see a white triangle that does not actually exist. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F60da8bc7-2fb9-4f00-9a53-16b3ffc579b2.png/size/" alt="Gestalt Illusion"></p>
<p>In <em>Monument Valley</em>‘s “Ida’s RED Dream: AIDS charity special edition”, the third level uses the art of Gestalt visual illusion. This is a castle that cannot exist in the real world. Each light gray corridor can be completed by rotating the dark blue building. Players can rely on previous visual experience to automatically connect the corridors. In the game, once the light and shadow are unified, it means that a new path has appeared. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F33fea8c0-c1b0-4eec-9edf-1877fcc9a726.png/size/" alt="Monument Valley Ida&#39;s Dream"></p>
<p>In the game <em>Gorogoa</em>, the game screen is divided into four parts, and each area will present a scene for players to explore. Players can zoom in on objects in the picture and find clues that can be spliced or embedded with other scenes, so that the originally static picture will become an animation. This game cleverly uses the Gestalt illusion suspense formed by perceptual prediction and integrates it into the traditional jigsaw puzzle game rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2Fd5e1dc12-7b26-4569-a22d-31c14bf4b633.png/size/" alt="Gorogoa"></p>
<h2 id="4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players"><a href="#4-Why-Do-Optical-Illusion-Games-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?"></a>4. Why Do Optical Illusion Games Attract Players?</h2><p>Why can optical illusion games attract players with these wonderful visual phenomena? We have mainly summarized the following three aspects.</p>
<h3 id="Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene"><a href="#Increase-the-Interaction-Between-Players-and-the-Game-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene"></a>Increase the Interaction Between Players and the Game Scene</h3><p>When the game character moves in the game space, it generally faces a fixed, preset picture. The perspective centered on the picture rather than the player’s control can better present the picture content, and it is also an optimized design that can smoothly advance the plot development, but it can also be critically considered as a manifestation of technological dehumanization.</p>
<p>Video games are places that pursue interactivity, and creators are constantly looking for ways to break the restrictions that bind players’ hands and feet. Optical illusion elements provide this possibility for game creators. In optical illusion games, players are no longer bystanders of the game screen. By manipulating the game perspective, players can actively change certain elements in the game scene. Players enhance their sense of immersion and substitution through interaction with the game scene.</p>
<h3 id="Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes"><a href="#Break-Through-Conventional-Thinking-and-Find-the-Connection-Between-Different-Game-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes"></a>Break Through Conventional Thinking and Find the Connection Between Different Game Scenes</h3><p>In the game <em>Moncage</em>, players need to explore by interacting with objects in different worlds, and use visual errors to find a perfect angle to splice certain objects in the two worlds. The process of finding connections in different worlds in the game is not a blind trial and error, but players use their unique observation and imagination to break through the dimensions of time and space to find connections and unlock new spaces one by one. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20220916%2F2c79c833-1183-4980-8df2-c12dc74a8670.png/size/" alt="Moncage"></p>
<p>The core gameplay of optical illusion games is to change perspectives and use visual differences to find the connections between different scenes, which requires players to break through conventional thinking and explore the true connections between the visual illusions presented in the game screen from different angles. Players can also gain a strong sense of satisfaction after exploring and completing the level.</p>
<h3 id="The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving"><a href="#The-Dual-Pleasure-of-Aesthetics-and-Puzzle-Solving" class="headerlink" title="The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving"></a>The Dual Pleasure of Aesthetics and Puzzle Solving</h3><p>The pictures of optical illusion games are constructed from unique geometric figures and comfortable colors, and are supplemented by beautiful music to give players a beautiful sensory enjoyment. Through the combination of audio-visual elements, players can understand the artistic conception and gameplay of the optical illusion space as a whole, and discover and complete task plots during the interaction process to obtain psychological satisfaction. Players can get the dual pleasure of aesthetics and puzzle solving throughout the game process.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article introduces the main optical illusion phenomena, including: impossible spaces, perspective, and Gestalt illusions. The ingenious design of optical illusions can allow players to experience a visual feast that violates the laws of physics and the pleasure of exploration and puzzle solving. In the game, players need to use their own unique thinking, change perspectives, and use visual differences to combine seemingly unrelated scenes. Incorporating optical illusion elements into action, adventure, role-playing and other games to increase the fun gameplay may also allow players to gain a wonderful experience.</p>

    <title>The Use of Inclusive Language in Games and Their Localization</title>
    <url>/2022/10/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20221101_28584_1050173/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221101/28584_1050173.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>“Words have power, words are power, words could be your power.” — Mohammed Qahtani</p>
<p>In the process of games going global, we often rely on two types of text to communicate directly with players: one is in-game text; the other is communication within the community. These two types of discourse need to fully express the game maker’s game concept, creative ideas, and in-depth thinking, to avoid causing unintended discrimination and prejudice among players.</p>
<p>The game market research agency Newzoo once launched a player sentiment study on more than 1,500 people and released a report saying that diversity, fairness, and inclusion are becoming increasingly important in games. Many players do not necessarily feel a sense of belonging in the game or feel welcome in the game community, and these current situations are closely related to the use of inclusive language. This article will introduce inclusive language and its use in the game localization process.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process"><a href="#1-Why-Use-“Inclusive-Language”-in-the-Localization-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?"></a>1. Why Use “Inclusive Language” in the Localization Process?</h2><p>Inclusive language aims to avoid “expressions that express or imply ideas that are sexist, racist, or otherwise biased, prejudiced, or denigrating to any particular group of people.”</p>
<p>Inclusive language is based on the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI principles). It strives to avoid expressing or implying prejudice against any particular group of people, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups, and does not contain any content that may imply that a person is superior to another because of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability, or health status.</p>
<p>When we serve players from different backgrounds and of different types, of course, the producers do not want to form an opposition with a certain group because of this unnecessary or unintended language offense, which will have a bad impact on the game. It is a terrible consequence for the game to be opposed and boycotted, so it is particularly important to create an inclusive and diverse game environment and game community.</p>
<h2 id="2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve"><a href="#2-The-Fluidity-of-Language-Why-Did-My-Words-Hit-a-Nerve" class="headerlink" title="2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?"></a>2. The Fluidity of Language: Why Did My Words Hit a Nerve?</h2><p>The definition of euphemism is “the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant”. If the localization team does not know what is offensive or what is unpleasant, the definition of euphemism becomes problematic.</p>
<p>And with cultural shifts, some originally “safe words” may also be introduced with risks. For example, the word “genius” has also been listed among words with gender inequality, class, and racial assumptions.</p>
<p>A recent interesting example discussed gender-inclusive solutions related to the nouns “mother” and “father”, suggesting the use of “gestational parent” and “non-birthing parent” instead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F85630923-c730-4201-806d-20bbb960c33e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Twitter officially released some “problem words” and recommended replacement words</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The sensitive vocabulary mentioned above has also rapidly changed all aspects of game products. To avoid gender-sensitive words, EA went a step further in <em>The Sims 4</em> and directly removed the binary male and female categories from the creation menu. The localization practice of <em>The Sims 4</em> is also simple and effective: use non-gender-specific terms (for example, use “Police officer” instead of “Policeman” when describing “police”); look for neutral structures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fc3b88c23-584a-44de-8c85-e05461b86959.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Expressing-Friendliness-Four-Categories-of-Problems-and-Game-Practices"><a href="#3-Expressing-Friendliness-Four-Categories-of-Problems-and-Game-Practices" class="headerlink" title="3. Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices"></a>3. Expressing Friendliness: Four Categories of Problems and Game Practices</h2><p>In fact, many schools, publishing houses, etc. will organize “language guides” to serve diverse communities. Taking the “inclusive language guide” newly released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington in 2022 as an example, “problem words” are divided into four categories: racial, ethnic, national, religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native discrimination; disability discrimination; age discrimination; and gender and sexual orientation discrimination. When applied to games, we can also refer to them. The following are the problems that are prone to occur in each category.</p>
<h3 id="Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio"><a href="#Racial-Ethnic-National-Religious-and-Indigenous-Native-Discriminatio" class="headerlink" title="Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio."></a>Racial, Ethnic, National, Religious, and Indigenous&#x2F;Native Discriminatio.</h3><p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fa4938950-ba42-457f-8724-76092fa6aff5.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="“Inclusive-Language-Guide”-released-by-the-Information-Technology-College-of-the-University-of-Washington"><a href="#“Inclusive-Language-Guide”-released-by-the-Information-Technology-College-of-the-University-of-Washington" class="headerlink" title="“Inclusive Language Guide” released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington"></a><em>“Inclusive Language Guide” released by the Information Technology College of the University of Washington</em></h2><p>Using black and white to metaphorically represent good and evil is an offense. Associating white people with good and black people with evil is called the “black is black effect”. Muhammad Ali said in an interview in the 1980s: “…we got some things called White House cigars, White Swan soap, King White soap, White Cloud tissue… Angel food is white cake, and devil’s food is chocolate cake.”</p>
<p>Black and white are often considered to be derivatives of racist metaphors, with “black” representing undesirable, wrong, or bad things; “white” represents desirable, correct, and good things. These words perpetuate the concepts once used to oppress people of color. So in games, common inclusive language for term replacement includes: whitelist (changed to allowlist), blacklist (changed to blocklist), etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fef688944-7b9a-47c5-af8d-0cb87943a6c7.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In “Naraka: Bladepoint”, “Blocklist” is used instead of “Blacklist” to refer to the blacklist.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination"><a href="#Disability-Discrimination-Age-Discrimination" class="headerlink" title="Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination"></a>Disability Discrimination, Age Discrimination</h3><p>These two types of pitfalls do not appear frequently in the game. In the process of daily player contact or questionnaire design, we will use many words related to “people” and “identity”. By comparing the following, we can find that in the localization process, we should avoid describing people’s “aging” and “defectiveness”. </p>

This means that when we use words, we need to pay special attention to “gender-neutral words”. Newzoo also pointed out that “the old stereotype that games are only for boys or men no longer exists”. </p>

It has provided players with a third (genderless) option during the character creation process.</em></h2><p>There are many mistakes that are easy to make in gendered words. Let’s take the word “Guys” as an example:</p>
<p>The word “guys” originally referred to the English historical figure Guy Fawkes, but in the mid-18th century to the 20th century, the word began to be used in the United States to refer to “men” in general. Because there was no suitable phrase to represent the plural form of “you”, the plural form of “guys” eventually evolved into a colloquial form used to refer to a group of people.</p>
<p>Today, the word does not always mean “plural of men”, but critics believe that the word is sexist because, although it claims to be neutral, it actually positions men as the “default”. For women in male-dominated industries, using “guys” to refer to the whole reinforces their sense of being a minority. The word is also problematic for gender non-conforming people, for whom “guys” may be a misrepresentation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F4fb2b984-ab17-40e6-b4f1-bf67d5c781ad.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”"><a href="#“New-Rules—Never-Say-Hi-Guys”" class="headerlink" title="“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”"></a><em>“New Rules—Never Say Hi Guys”</em></h2><p>Similarly, you should not call a group of women “girls” at work, as this is demeaning and offensive. Phrases that should not be used when talking to or about women: Girls, Bossy, Feisty, Ball bust, Shrill, Sweetie, honey-bun.</p>
<p>In the community, instead of “hey guys”, we are more encouraged to use “hey everyone”, “hey everybody” or the simpler “hey all”. Of course, some games have more unique names for their players, such as players of <em>For All Time</em> being called “使君大人” (Shǐ jūn dàrén), and players of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> being called “forerunners”, etc. These words will give players a more intimate and inclusive feeling.</p>
<h2 id="4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism"><a href="#4-Inclusive-Design-of-Multilingualism" class="headerlink" title="4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism"></a>4. Inclusive Design of Multilingualism</h2><p>The relative flexibility of English allows us to successfully navigate these unsettling and exclusive terms and phrases and find alternatives. However, in other languages, this is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at an example from Lera’s Broditsky’s TED Talk: There are ten pictures of people to be arranged in order. The instruction is: “Arrange the pictures from the youngest-looking to the oldest-looking.”</p>
<p>People who speak European languages usually arrange them from left to right, but people who speak Mandarin may arrange them from top to bottom, while people who speak Hebrew or Arabic arrange them from right to left. These differences come from different languages’ perceptions and expressions of time, and the concepts and vocabulary that exist in certain languages. For people who speak the Australian indigenous language Kuuk Thaayorre, right and left do not exist, so if you ask them for directions, they will not tell you to go straight and turn right, but for example, go south and then west.</p>
<p>There are many similar differences. Some languages differ in how they divide the color spectrum, and the boundaries between colors are not universal. In English, we have the word blue, which includes any different shades of blue. However, in Ukrainian, there is no such word, because the language distinguishes between light blue and dark blue. Some other languages only have a few colors, such as “light” and “dark”. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2Fe4e796a6-4bd5-4cc4-96e5-2d25b11752d8.png/size/"></h2><h2 id="Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”"><a href="#Language-differences-between-“light-blue”-and-“dark-blue”" class="headerlink" title="Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”"></a><em>Language differences between “light blue” and “dark blue”</em></h2><p>Among the 6,900 languages in the world, more than 1&#x2F;4 of the languages make a distinction between genders. In addition to the differences in the use of color, left and right, etc. in different language environments mentioned above, in the process of multilingual localization, we can follow the following rules to use gender-related inclusive language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spanish:</strong> Use “@” or “X” to replace the letters that set the gender of words. Although not officially recognized, this has been a common usage in the past few years. But there is an inconvenience: these characters cannot be pronounced or read by text-to-speech applications, which will affect the dubbing of game audio and create obstacles for visually impaired people using such software.</li>
<li><strong>Italian:</strong> Using an asterisk (*) instead of –a (feminine) and –o (masculine) in words or using “@” for plural has become a common practice, especially online. However, this usage also has certain problems. If overused, the text will be full of asterisks, and symbols will appear every other word, causing reading difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>German:</strong> In German, the asterisk (<em>) can also be used to indicate that there are more variants besides the displayed variants. For example, “der</em>die Priester*in” represents all genders in the spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>French:</strong> In French, we are witnessing the reinvention of language. For example, creating gender-inclusive pronouns to merge known masculine and feminine forms into one (iel&#x2F;yel&#x2F;yelle&#x2F;ille&#x2F;ol), while creating new grammatical declensions for nouns and adjectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221101%2F4cf6e0e0-abb6-46ab-b083-2f0ca14d5352.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>With the large-scale increase in the number of global game players, games have penetrated into people’s daily lives. It is a concern for game manufacturers and even the entire game industry to allow every player to find a setting corresponding to themselves in the game, or to allow players of different attributes to feel equal, fair, and concerned in the game. Among them, the inclusive language of games is becoming increasingly important. We can use it to help build a fairer game world, so that the game can be suitable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, etc. At the same time, in the game localization process, we also need to take cultural differences into account, and adjust the content in combination with local culture, language habits, etc., so as to more accurately meet the needs of the target market.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221101/28584_1050175.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sports games have always been an important category in the global game market, and can be said to be a game genre that has run through a considerable period of history in the field of video games. No matter how the hardware environment changes or how the game market trends change, this type of theme has never been outdated. FIFA, NBA 2K, Pro Evolution Soccer, etc., these familiar and popular sports games for many gamers, also fully demonstrate the value of sports games.</p>
<p>For players, sports games can be regarded as a kind of casual game, occasionally playing a game of competition, or as a development game, where you can cultivate your favorite teams, players, etc.; and sports games also have the passion of fair competition that all games do not have, which is exciting. In foreign countries, the potential of the sports game market can be said to have been fully exploited, but in China, the situation seems to be not optimistic. With a large number of sports users, the corresponding market has been lukewarm, and the mobile game aspect is even worse. It seems that sports games have not yet found their track. Even big IPs from console platforms such as NBA 2K and FIFA have not been able to fully awaken the sports mobile game market.</p>
<p>Since the prospect of the sports game market is so promising and has been so stable for many years, why are there so few sports games that can stand out in China’s popular mobile game market?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products"><a href="#1-What-You-See-Is-Not-What-You-Think-Big-Market-Few-Products" class="headerlink" title="1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products"></a>1. What You See Is Not What You Think: Big Market, Few Products</h2><p>The direction of users’ attention determines the preference of developers and publishers for theme selection. The audience of global major sports events is undoubtedly concentrated in football, and the NBA, as one of the most popular sports events, also has a large audience. When it comes to games, football and basketball games are also the two most numerous sports game categories. Unlike other forms of entertainment, sports are more likely to inspire people’s passion and even generate emotional attachment.</p>
<p>However, in China, compared with other game categories, there have always been relatively few sports games on the market. This is related to the characteristics of sports games themselves. Sports games such as FIFA, Pro Evolution Soccer, NBA 2K, and NBA LIVE all have very distinct labels: professional.</p>
<p>This is mainly reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, most of the fans of sports games are themselves fans or fans of the sport, and non-fans rarely get involved; on the other hand, sports games have a high threshold for research and development, such as physical collisions, operating feel, adaptation engines, player AI, etc., which also greatly increases the difficulty of research and development.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About"><a href="#2-A-Big-Cake-That-No-One-Cares-About" class="headerlink" title="2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?"></a>2. A Big Cake That No One Cares About?</h2><p>Why is such a big cake, but the actual performance is not satisfactory?</p>
<h3 id="Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization"><a href="#Monotonous-Gameplay-Serious-Homogenization" class="headerlink" title="Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization"></a>Monotonous Gameplay, Serious Homogenization</h3><p>Because sports games rely on sports events, their basic gameplay is nothing more than PVP (player-to-player) around the event, especially in mobile games, which is also the most acceptable mode for most players. However, monotonous gameplay will accelerate boredom, and PVP is not a permanent solution. Production teams often enrich the player experience by adding game modes. However, the harsh reality is that no matter what kind of attempt, it cannot solve the fundamental problem of the game. Most players will still choose the most basic PVP mode. Of course, there are also many players who will play against the computer on console sports games.</p>
<p>In addition, the emergence of highly homogeneous products is also a need for market competition. When a manufacturer launches a new model, other manufacturers will subsequently “copy” one. After all, they are games of the same category, and they cannot let competitors have something they don’t have, so the products on the market are developing in an increasingly similar direction. Under such circumstances, when the gameplay of sports games is too monotonous and the homogenization of sports games is strong, the potential of the entire sports game market will naturally be difficult to explode.</p>
<h3 id="Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation"><a href="#Loyal-to-the-Project-Stick-to-the-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation"></a>Loyal to the Project, Stick to the Operation</h3><p>For sports game players, whether they are basketball fans or football fans, or fans of other sports, most of them continue to invest their energy in the game in order to continue the feeling of sweating on the field of their favorite sports, or to experience the operations that cannot be realized in real life in the game. In this way, even if our bodies are exhausted, we can still enjoy spiritual happiness. Therefore, sports players do not have a variety of types to choose from in terms of game selection like other players. They generally only play according to their sports hobbies. Even if new games appear, as long as they have nothing to do with their favorite projects, I am afraid they will not pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>In addition, for sports games that focus on operational confrontation, in order to reproduce the feel of the game on the real field through virtual programs and find a feeling of being on the scene, even if their operation methods are simplified, the operation difficulty is still higher than other competitive games, and it requires continuous improvement of self-operation to complete the game process to obtain a higher sense of accomplishment. Because there is a certain operational threshold, many mobile game players who are mainly casual will naturally not pay special attention to such games.</p>
<h3 id="Prone-to-Imbalance"><a href="#Prone-to-Imbalance" class="headerlink" title="Prone to Imbalance"></a>Prone to Imbalance</h3><p>The key to the gameplay of sports games lies in operating skills. The importance of skills in such games is self-evident. Its design will not only affect novice players, but also affect the operating manufacturers.</p>
<p>If the gameplay skills of a video game become very important, this will lead to many players being unwilling to spend money to buy game props. Most players will have such an idea: “Anyway, I can defeat my opponent with my ability, why bother spending that money”.</p>
<p>In this case, ordinary props are no longer attractive. In order to strive for a better return on investment in the limited business model of sports competitive games, games may launch more props that enhance attributes; and over time, the amplitude of attribute enhancement will become larger and larger, but this is the beginning of a game losing its balance. When more and more players spend a lot of money to buy high-attribute props, it may cause a group of players who enjoy fair competition to leave the game, because on the premise of relatively close skills, the improvement of props to attributes is like an insurmountable gap, which creates a serious vicious circle: “Reduction in the number of players - Difficulties in the income of agents - Agents make money on attribute props - Game imbalance”. In the end, it will become the original sin of player churn.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Do-Players-Want"><a href="#3-What-Do-Players-Want" class="headerlink" title="3. What Do Players Want?"></a>3. What Do Players Want?</h2><p>What kind of game do players who come from sports competitions need?</p>
<p>Looking at people who love sports, they have many things in common - love sports, pay attention to competitions, have a flamboyant personality, and trust teamwork. Therefore, if you want to capture the hearts of sports game users, you must start with professional needs, viewing needs, personality needs, and social needs.</p>
<p>Many players like to play the corresponding sports games of the projects they actually participate in in reality, because they want to replicate the feel of the hand&#x2F;foot in reality, or experience some elements that cannot be realized in actual sports projects. Therefore, to a certain extent, reasonably moving reality to the virtual world is always the pursuit of developers and players. In addition, some sports enthusiasts may not have been gamers before. The low threshold for getting started with the game, while having both technology and operational depth, can play a key role in expanding the player base, especially for mobile gamers. Of course, for some products that may not pursue IP, cool and gorgeous operations are always one of the biggest selling points to attract players: I wasn’t aiming for the players in the first place. If the actions are still plain, how can I be attracted? After all, for most gamers, the operation is only temporary, but being handsome is a lifetime.</p>
<p>In today’s era of increasingly developed hardware equipment, games with high-quality sound and pictures often have richer expressiveness and stronger appeal, and creating a sense of presence and immersion is also an important part of the game’s ability to attract players. Especially for sports games, the viewing value of the picture and action is more important. Regardless of whether it is related to sports feelings, or to IP and classic events, even if the audience is relatively fixed, the game also needs to arouse topics and awaken players’ attention. Players also hope to experience games with higher popularity.</p>
<h2 id="4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track"><a href="#4-Opening-Up-a-New-Track" class="headerlink" title="4. Opening Up a New Track?"></a>4. Opening Up a New Track?</h2><p>Even the best wine is not afraid of a deep alley. In the face of the dilemma of the sports game market, the quality of the game alone is not enough to break the situation. For a sports game, good game quality can attract fans of this series, but to seek breakthroughs, more sports enthusiasts and even sports pan-entertainment users need to know and accept it.</p>
<h3 id="Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events"><a href="#Synchronous-Operation-with-Physical-Events" class="headerlink" title="Synchronous Operation with Physical Events"></a>Synchronous Operation with Physical Events</h3><p>If you want to expand the coverage, how to promote it has become a difficult problem. It is necessary to find effective brand exposure methods to build momentum for the game before or during the corresponding sports events to attract fans’ attention.</p>
<p>Use promotion methods that are synchronized with the operation period of sports events, and use platform resources in many aspects, not limited to game platforms. This will help to spread the influence of the game itself, so that users of multiple platforms will continue to increase their favorability of the game. Sports games themselves, as a category with a potentially huge user base, everyone, regardless of gender, age, likes sports, loves sports, but how to subdivide and differentiate users of this magnitude, and operate them in a refined manner, is worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="Creation-of-eSports-Event-System"><a href="#Creation-of-eSports-Event-System" class="headerlink" title="Creation of eSports Event System"></a>Creation of eSports Event System</h3><p>Create an event system, and then go out of the circle, so as to attract more fans to enter the game and increase player stickiness. For sports competitive games, on the basis of the current widespread e-sports alliance, we can try to build a complete sports game e-sports event system, while broadening the channels for public participation, and complete a larger scale of sinking and penetration; combined with community operation experience, promote “small community” type events in the game, making it easier for the public to participate in e-sports, and then introduce in-game events to offline communities.</p>
<p>For a sports game, the things that test people are definitely not just the above. In the final analysis, it is necessary to return to the game itself. How to design each stage of the game so that players do not have the fatigue of constantly repeating the season; how to set up players, how to let players play an unforgettable game, etc., these are also tricky. After all, the key to measuring an excellent sports game is to see whether it can narrow the distance between the game world and the real sports competition, and at the same time take into account the operability of the game, so that players can truly get an immersive and pleasant experience from the game.</p>

    <title>How to Build Playability Experience with Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics</title>
    <url>/2022/11/10/netease-ux-articles/news_20221123_28584_1053891/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221123/28584_1053891.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the game market develops, various games are constantly seeking new gameplay and game mechanics, striving to bring players novel and high-quality experiences. Game mechanics are like thousands of ways of arranging and combining various game elements, and they are gradually moving towards a more complex direction.</p>
<p>If a game is a process where players voluntarily overcome unnecessary obstacles, then how can we design interactions to make players willing to pay for these unnecessary obstacles instead of feeling bored? This article will elaborate on this in detail.</p>
<h2 id="1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#1-Starting-with-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="1. Starting with Game Mechanics"></a>1. Starting with Game Mechanics</h2><p>In Wikipedia, the description of game mechanics is as follows: In tabletop games and video games, game mechanics are constructs of rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state, thus providing gameplay. In other words, the mechanics of the game effectively regulate how the game will serve the person playing the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, this concept can perhaps be divided into two parts: “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics.” The former represents the player’s actual operation when using the device, such as “pressing WASD on the keyboard respectively”; while the latter is the corresponding action of the virtual character in the game, such as “the game protagonist walks in various directions respectively.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Ff3f5f4e6-b559-4a5a-a0a9-db70af47ac1d.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Just Dance 2》| Rasputin - Boney M. | Gameplay</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is high, players do not need to spend too much energy on the conversion mechanism between real operation and virtual feedback. For example, in the <em>Just Dance</em> series, the actions of the virtual characters are consistent with the player’s real actions, so players do not need to think about “what kind of actions do I need to perform to get a higher score?” They just need to imitate the characters in the game, so the playability of this game is high. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fa995ed01-2602-4a8c-86b9-52b24cf45141.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Longsword Advanced Aerial Combo</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the similarity between concrete mechanics and abstract mechanics is not high, the playability of the game decreases, but it also brings more room for operation. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, in order for the character to execute the appropriate combo, the player needs to press a series of buttons at the appropriate time nodes in order to realize the conversion of real actions to virtual character actions, which has higher requirements for the player’s various comprehensive operations. In this kind of more complex game mechanics, how to create high playability is a test that designers must face.</p>
<p>“Playing a game” is “voluntarily overcoming unnecessary obstacles.” — Bernard Suits, <em>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</em></p>
<p>As the game market continues to expand, the game’s mechanisms have also become more complex in permutation and combination. How to make players voluntarily accept these complex mechanisms in the game? This requires interaction design to communicate “concrete mechanics” and “abstract mechanics”, efficiently complete the interaction between players and the game, that is, the game will give feedback in time according to the player’s input, helping players make operations in the most friendly and effective way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics"><a href="#2-Interaction-in-Complex-Game-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics"></a>2. Interaction in Complex Game Mechanics</h2><p><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, mentioned earlier, includes game mechanics such as scenes, teams, actions, confrontations, matching, and skills. Therefore, this section mainly uses the combat content of this game as an example to illustrate the role of interaction in complex mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics"><a href="#Novice-Tutorial-Auxiliary-Explanation-of-Complex-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics"></a>Novice Tutorial: Auxiliary Explanation of Complex Mechanics</h3><p>First of all, the most straightforward auxiliary explanation is the familiar “novice tutorial.” In games, it is very efficient and necessary to use the novice tutorial method for interaction with core or unfamiliar mechanics. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, because its combat contains a lot of information, in addition to the common team and poison elements of battle royale games, it also contains many hero characteristics, souljades and other content.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the novice tutorial, the UI of the interface is unfolded in sequence. It can be seen that the initial interface of the novice tutorial only contains basic information, orientation, and map information that players are familiar with, while other content will appear with corresponding UI information as the tutorial unfolds. This is to allow players to gradually understand the game’s combat mechanics, and try to avoid players experiencing frustration and resistance when encountering too much complex information. </p>

<p>The novice tutorial of this game can be opened by yourself when selecting the mode on the homepage, providing a quick entry to the novice tutorial, which is also a common method for games with more complex mechanics. However, games with simpler mechanics are more likely to enter the tutorial directly when entering the game for the first time, and no tutorial entry will be provided after that. In addition, no matter whether the novice tutorial mechanism is simple or complex, it is generally necessary to provide players with a channel to “exit&#x2F;skip” the tutorial immediately, such as pressing the Esc key at any time in the tutorial to return to the lobby.</p>
<h3 id="Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles"><a href="#Concretization-of-Abstract-Mechanisms-Rationalizing-the-Logic-of-Creating-Unnecessary-Obstacles" class="headerlink" title="Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles"></a>Concretization of Abstract Mechanisms: Rationalizing the Logic of Creating Unnecessary Obstacles</h3><p>The medium of player interaction in complex mechanics is almost still the keyboard and mouse or the controller, and the moves of the characters in the game in combat are very complex, so most of the abstract mechanics and concrete mechanics in combat are very dissimilar. To improve the playability experience of the game, interaction design can try to add concrete elements to abstract mechanisms to increase the similarity between abstract mechanisms and concrete mechanisms psychologically, so as to obtain a better immersive experience and playability experience.</p>
<p>For example, when using the grappling hook item in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players and the keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;controller obviously cannot interact like the grappling hook and the character, but the aiming feedback that appears after pressing the “Q” key, and the fixed feedback of the rope flying out after clicking the mouse, all improve the player’s playability experience through the concrete UI. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fb3af826c-3087-470d-a544-3749e412d68c.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 When using the grappling hook in the game, press “Q” and the aiming interaction feedback appears.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, sometimes in order to increase the challenge of the game, the game will adopt the opposite abstract and concrete mechanisms. At this time, it is very important to let players feel the rationality of the interaction method in the interface. Because essentially, this is the player voluntarily giving up the means to quickly achieve the goal, and voluntarily accepting certain restrictions, choosing a “low-efficiency” way to participate in the game.</p>
<p>For example, in the segment of driving a wooden boat in <em>It Takes Two</em>, when the player controlling Cody sprays honey backwards, the effect of spraying to the left is that the wooden boat moves to the right. At this time, the direction of the player’s operation and the direction of the wooden boat are opposite, but in the interface, the form of Cody spraying honey at the tail as power allows the player to understand the logic of the opposite operation and voluntarily accept this setting that increases the difficulty. This is the same principle in its famous airplane flying segment. </p>

<ul>
<li>Highlight the central area of the screen, leaving enough vision for combat;</li>
<li>Various combat information is classified and integrated, distributed in appropriate positions around the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fc1fae52b-7a9b-4c5b-acad-5e3567e503a8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Combat Interface Information Layout</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Here, in the combat interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the clotting salve, armor powder, and weapon box, which are also props, are displayed in different blocks, also out of consideration of content relevance, so that players can consider whether to use the weapon box to repair the weapon while paying attention to the weapon durability in the lower right corner, facilitating the player’s interaction process. In addition, there is a special key prompt block in this interface, and there are key icons at the skills, weapons, and map, also in order to make it easier for players to fight in complex mechanisms through efficient and reasonable interaction.</p>
<p>Complex game mechanics have limited the conditions for players to achieve game victory. The work of interaction design needs to facilitate players so that they can voluntarily accept these constraints and enjoy them. The classification and integration of information is very important here. Efficient information presentation enables players in the game to quickly retrieve the information they need on the screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F819d980e-0d7a-4199-b2c4-9c71c7be9c4c.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Replacing-Text-with-Images-Sounds-Serving-the-Player’s-Efficient-Information-Acquisition-Experience"><a href="#Replacing-Text-with-Images-Sounds-Serving-the-Player’s-Efficient-Information-Acquisition-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Replacing Text with Images&#x2F;Sounds: Serving the Player’s Efficient Information Acquisition Experience"></a>Replacing Text with Images&#x2F;Sounds: Serving the Player’s Efficient Information Acquisition Experience</h3><p>In fact, the core of “replacing text with images&#x2F;sounds” and “efficient arrangement of HUD information” is the same, that is, to achieve efficient information reading for players through the interactive interface and sound effects. Images are symbolic languages that are easier for people to process than text, and there are almost no localization differences; while the interaction of sound does not need to occupy additional vision in the interface.</p>
<p>Also taking the presentation of skill and prop information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example. The UI of the ultimate skill CD is the icon of Viper Ning, and the surrounding circular progress bar and the Arabic numerals above quickly inform the player of the CD status. After the CD is completed, the outer glow effect and key prompts appear, and at the same time, it is matched with the in-game character voice prompt. The visual presentation part is efficient and cross-language, and the auditory part is efficient and extremely immediate. This interactive presentation is very efficient, and it also connects different states of the UI, thereby building a user experience that serves the player. </p>

For example, adding a “character” mechanism to ordinary battle royale game mechanics requires attention to the character characteristics of oneself and the opponent in the game; adding “skills” and “ranged&#x2F;melee weapons” mechanisms is accompanied by the necessary presentation of skill and weapon information in the game. However, if too much information is presented in the interface, it is easy to make players daunting at the initial contact, or it is difficult to find the point where the line of sight needs to be focused in the game.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in the presentation of weapon-related information in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the visual effect is weakened by increasing the transparency of weapons that are equipped but not in use, which can more intuitively display the selected state of the weapon, and also save valuable screen vision. Hiding information does not mean reducing information, but making hidden information display when needed. The same is true for pop-up windows and folded pages in various game interfaces. Players do not need to see it directly on the main interface, they just need to be able to open it smoothly and independently when needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1b6bdb14-2456-408d-80e4-e340613da08e.png/size/"></p>

<p>When do you notice the presence of the UI during the game? - When the game UI is done very poorly.</p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is almost a UI-less interface. Only a prompt or icon will appear on the screen, but players do not feel that there is too little information or that the operation is not smooth in the game, which is also an effective hiding of information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F68d4c4f4-a491-4bb8-9375-8816e598b11c.jpg/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Playability, also known as gameplay, reflects the impact of all internal components of the game on the player’s gaming experience, and the components can include game rules, game interaction with the player, game challenges and difficulty, etc., that is, “what players can do.” In other words, the reason why a game can become a game is precisely because it has playability, allowing players to obtain fun in its limited mechanisms.</p>
<p>For the presentation of game mechanics, the UI is the player’s “mechanism translator”; for the playability of the game, the UI is the player’s “operation helper”. Whether it is game workers or players, they will be excited about more and wider unknown game mechanics. How to better interpret the new composite game mechanics and how to let the mechanics bring players a high-quality experience are difficult problems that UI design needs to consider.</p>

    <title>“Join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect” Don’t Let Game Trainers Ruin the Experience</title>
    <url>/2022/11/04/netease-ux-articles/news_20221123_28584_1053894/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221123/28584_1053894.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In competitive games, normal players are deeply disgusted by cheaters. However, when some players are enjoying the game, they encounter obstacles that they cannot bypass, or hurdles they cannot overcome. There are always some people who will take the wrong path, using third-party software to modify game data, directly cheating, or cutting off the opponent’s network cable. The act of running third-party software is usually not only strongly condemned by the majority of players, but will also be severely punished by the game officials, ranging from warnings to account bans. However, in single-player games, players seem to be more tolerant of modifying game values, and prefer to call the “cheats” of single-player games “trainers”.</p>
<p>For example, a very popular meme among players is - Join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, which is a trainer for a cultivation game. Because the game randomly generates many plots, some players are repeatedly chased or robbed and want to vent their anger, while some players’ Taoist companions are killed and want revenge. At this time, some players will ask them to join the Feng Ling Yue Ying Sect, that is, they suggest that the other party use a trainer. It seems that players are not resistant to this form, and even using it properly can enhance the game experience. So how should we correctly view and use trainers?</p>
<h2 id="1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification"><a href="#1-What-Behaviors-Can-Be-Called-Modification" class="headerlink" title="1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?"></a>1. What Behaviors Can Be Called Modification?</h2><p>On Steam, many games have “Workshop”, in which there are many player-made and provided game Mods. Mod is taken from the first three letters of the word modification.</p>
<p>There are many types of Mods. Fashion Mods are used to change the appearance of characters. In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, players can use fashion Mods to turn themselves into various different characters. Map Mods can change the in-game map or directly create a new map. In <em>CS: GO</em>, there are many players who spontaneously form community servers to play hide-and-seek modes that are not available on official servers. There are also many other game content Mods such as sound effects and skills. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1d879bc3-00e9-4283-9255-2c285db4be54.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p>Human Fall Flat, players use Mods to create custom skins</p>
<hr>
<p>The production of these contents is essentially a modification of the game. The existence of Mods is to increase the game content and allow players to experience things outside the game itself, and the continued popularity of many games is also due to the large number of Mods. Some people may think of DLC here, the content of which is similar to some Mods. To distinguish Mods from game DLC, Mods can be understood more as content spontaneously produced and released by players, and they are generally free to use. However, due to technical limitations, they may have some compatibility issues with the game or other Mods. DLC is officially produced and launched game expansion content, which usually requires payment to experience, and is naturally more compatible and stable than player-made Mods. </p>

<hr>
<p>Elden Ring wacky Mod that replaces the horse with Thomas the Tank Engine</p>
<hr>
<p>Compared with Mods, “game trainers” focus more violently on modifying game values and reducing game difficulty, so the functions are relatively simple and crude, with a list of several shortcut keys, players only need to move their fingers to completely subvert the game values. Common functions in trainers include infinite health, infinite mana, infinite money, and so on. I believe some people can still skillfully type Panzer, the cheat code for summoning tanks.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Want-to-Use-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?"></a>2. Why Do Players Want to Use Trainers?</h2><p>Different players may have very different pursuits and goals after entering the game, and these are also highly related to their different game experiences. In past research, we have summarized some reasons why players use trainers, and classified them.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Game-Difficulty"><a href="#Reduce-Game-Difficulty" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Game Difficulty"></a>Reduce Game Difficulty</h3><p>It is undeniable that many players have strong talents in gaming and can easily clear many difficult games. However, according to the player ability grading theory, these talented players only occupy a very small part of the top of the player pyramid. We can call them pro-gamers, some of whom are even close to the level of e-sports players. However, there are still many players whose game level is not so high, and the number of these players is much larger, and the overall ability level is also at the middle of the ability grading pyramid. They have certain operating strengths, but often want to experience more games in their spare time. However, the difficulty of some games is too high, and the outward ability performance based on experience and strength may not match this difficulty, which will cause them to spend a lot of time looking up guides, learning skills, and polishing moves.</p>
<p>However, leisure is their biggest purpose in playing games, not becoming stronger. Especially in single-player games, the appearance of trainers can help them experience the full content of the game more easily. Although the core content of some high-difficulty games is to experience hardship and become stronger little by little, if a player cannot persist in playing, then the follow-up of this game will have nothing to do with this player, including carefully crafted content such as plot stories, visual effects, and background music. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F354cb7c7-6356-48e8-8371-69273b40c560.png/size/" alt="The roguelike game Dead Cells, which sold 4 million copies, launched an official trainer in June 2022"></p>
<h3 id="Experience-Different-Game-Content"><a href="#Experience-Different-Game-Content" class="headerlink" title="Experience Different Game Content"></a>Experience Different Game Content</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, many game Mods or trainers can add a lot of new content for players to experience, even player-made BOSSes and side quests. The famous blacksmithing game <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> was released in 2019 and is still popular today. Some players are not satisfied with the normal + double difficulty content of the game itself, so some players have created a series of high-difficulty Mods such as Resurrection, Nightmare, and Gauntlets of Strength, among which Gauntlets of Strength even adds two side quests that are not in the main game. These game Mods have modified the difficulty of the game, added more moves to the BOSS, and allowed hardcore players to experience a cooler and more challenging <em>Sekiro</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F1790b6c1-fd60-41e2-89b0-11e7d98d662a.png/size/" alt="Sekiro Gauntlets of Strength Mod"></p>
<h3 id="“Protect-the-Liver”"><a href="#“Protect-the-Liver”" class="headerlink" title="“Protect the Liver”"></a>“Protect the Liver”</h3><p>Many RPG games have some extremely “grindy” tasks. These tasks either have extremely high material quantity requirements, or have difficulty and drop rate bottlenecks. Players often need to complete a large number of repetitive and boring farming processes to complete these tasks. Some players may not have any complaints about this repetitive step-by-step collection, but there are also players who do not like this boring collection process, and trainers can help players shorten the boring and repetitive game process, and can also provide some rest for the player’s “liver”.</p>
<p>For these players, the appearance of trainers is undoubtedly a godsend. The Japanese RPG game <em>Octopath Traveler</em> has a game mechanism where enemies may be encountered when moving, and the level limit is tied to the experience of the game plot. Players must repeat the mechanical farming and leveling to experience more of the plot, which makes many players call out that they are “tired”. Trainers can save some farming and leveling time for players who only want to experience the plot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Fbdbd84bd-42b2-4121-9c31-ad78a348c8e2.png/size/" alt="Octopath Traveler"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Game-More-Personalized"><a href="#Make-the-Game-More-Personalized" class="headerlink" title="Make the Game More Personalized"></a>Make the Game More Personalized</h3><p>Different players will have different preferences for game content, and game makers are not omnipotent and cannot cover the preferences of most players. Trainers can provide players with a “superpower” to quickly skip content they don’t like, allowing players to customize their personalized experience and focus more on the “boutique” content they really like to play.</p>
<h2 id="3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats"><a href="#3-Trainers-VS-Game-Cheats" class="headerlink" title="3. Trainers VS Game Cheats"></a>3. Trainers VS Game Cheats</h2><p>As mentioned at the beginning, many players are more tolerant of modifying game values in single-player games. This is the biggest difference between trainers and cheats - whether your behavior affects others, and whether your happiness is at the expense of other players’ gaming experience. The author believes that using trainers in single-player games only changes the game experience of the user alone. Whether it is increasing the difficulty or simplifying the process, most of them only affect the user himself; while using trainers in multiplayer battle mode will affect the game experience of everyone in the same game, and building one’s own happiness on the pain of others is extremely unfair to other players. Here, the multiplayer battle mode not only refers to the online multiplayer mode, but also content that is related to and competes with other players can be regarded as multiplayer mode, such as game leaderboards, speedruns, achievement acquisition, etc. Using trainers and other improper means to participate in this kind of competition will also not be recognized. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2F0ee7bcca-c1f8-4dc6-b211-0b4f75d05846.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers"><a href="#Disadvantages-and-Usage-Guidelines-of-Trainers" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers"></a>Disadvantages and Usage Guidelines of Trainers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Improper use will greatly accelerate the consumption speed of game content.</strong> When using trainers, direct numerical modifications should be reduced, and instead, some disliked game content should be reduced from the side. Different types of games have different core content. When using trainers, try to ensure that the core gameplay is not affected or is less affected. When experiencing survival games, when the player’s survival materials reach a level that cannot be used up, then the meaning of “survival” is lost. Therefore, in such games, try not to use trainers with unlimited resources; and when experiencing combat games, using trainers with unlimited health will distort the core experience of such games. The skipped process should be content that is meaningless to the user, not the core content of the game, to prevent the situation of being “invincible” but only being happy for half an hour, and then the whole game becomes boring.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221123%2Ff3a4a249-3426-44fd-8307-25c711b2f47b.png/size/" alt="The Dead Cells official trainer can choose the number of revives"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is easy to develop a dependence on trainers.</strong> The function of trainers is very powerful. Players only need to move their fingers to operate simple key combinations to solve almost all problems in the game. Such a simple and crude means of winning is easy to make people psychologically dependent. In fact, every time you use a trainer, you need to carefully consider which things should really be skipped with the trainer, so as to maximize the overall game experience. Excessive dependence and overuse of trainers can also easily make you miss important experiences and core fun points, and lose interest in the games that you originally expected and downloaded to play.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In order to obtain a “better” gaming experience, it is the original intention of most players to use trainers. In various game playthrough videos, there will be many “cloud players” who only watch game live videos and do not experience the game themselves. Some of them are because they don’t have time to grind, and some are because they are “handicapped” and can’t beat the game, so they can only see the excitement of the game in the video. Trainers do not have to be a target of criticism, but a tool that can be used well to help some players better enjoy the game. For players, if they can get more fun without affecting others, it is a successful modification.</p>

    <title>Is Fragmented Narrative Pretentious</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are many ways to tell a story. It can be expressed in novels, movies, plays, and many other art forms. Telling a story with a game has a very unique advantage, that is, interactivity. In the process of experiencing the game, players truly play the role of the characters in the story, connect with the characters in the story, and then advance the plot. In some games, the player’s behavior will also determine the final direction of the plot. The player is not only the listener of the story, but also the creator of the story. There are also many ways of game narration. This article will briefly introduce them, and focus on the advantages and disadvantages of fragmented narration and its application in games.</p>
<h2 id="I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration"><a href="#I-Common-Ways-of-Game-Narration" class="headerlink" title="I. Common Ways of Game Narration"></a>I. Common Ways of Game Narration</h2><h3 id="Linear-Narrative"><a href="#Linear-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Linear Narrative"></a>Linear Narrative</h3><p>Typical linear narratives include games such as <em>Death Stranding</em> and the <em>Call of Duty</em> series. These linear narrative games make players feel like watching a fine movie in terms of plot. There are a lot of main quests and cutscenes. Linear narrative sacrifices a certain degree of freedom in experience in exchange for the stability of players’ acceptance of the plot. Players are more passive in receiving plot information, such as watching a cutscene after completing a main quest to get the plot. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>The “Call of Duty” series uses a lot of game cutscenes, and the plot will be triggered after the player plays for a period of time</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Branching-Narrative"><a href="#Branching-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Branching Narrative"></a>Branching Narrative</h3><p>The overall structure is similar to linear narrative. The biggest difference is that branching points are added to the game. Players make different choices and enter different plot lines, such as <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, <em>Quantum Break</em>, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fd41affaa-872e-457b-99c8-a225bb512a4b.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="Fragmented Narrative"></a>Fragmented Narrative</h3><p>Literally, fragmented narrative is to split the overall plot into fragments and integrate them with various contents in the game. For example, after a player obtains a certain item, they obtain key clues about the relationship between characters in the game or the plot from the item description; when a player encounters a BOSS under certain conditions, they trigger hidden dialogues to obtain information; the main line of the fragmented narrative game will not be very clear. Players need to actively discover the information hidden in various corners and piece them together (sometimes requiring some imagination) to obtain a plot story understood and created by the players themselves. The following will also focus on examples.</p>
<h2 id="II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games"><a href="#II-Fragmented-Narrative-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="II. Fragmented Narrative in Games"></a>II. Fragmented Narrative in Games</h2><p>The application of fragmented narrative in games is very common. For example, in <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, a large amount of information is integrated with props, injecting this method of finding information in props into the player’s subconscious at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>The Wolf, played by the player, receives a letter from an unknown person at the beginning of the game. The description of this letter not only contains the content of the letter, but also a sentence “A letter thrown to the bottom of the well by someone”. It not only wants to inform the player of the content of the letter, but also wants the player to understand where this item comes from, what information is related to the item, who is it related to, and why. So that players slowly get used to this narrative method of integrating information into props, and gradually arouse their curiosity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F2db2a1ba-503d-4265-92f3-55f4dacddc20.png/size/"></p>
<p>Many settings in the game are not directly presented to the player in the form of animation or text, but are recorded in various items obtained by the player. Players will have a more cherished attitude towards the items obtained through difficult battles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F8d343e54-ca9d-4b7d-86e6-e96903e9d5d2.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F96db1573-f74a-4ea3-877d-7c3d943e42fd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Sekiro uses various props to tell the history of the Sekiro world</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the most direct plot is only the introduction of the game’s background, that is, heroes from all walks of life gather in Morus Isle to compete for the Immortal Mask. But are these heroes related to each other? For this reason, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also uses some fragmented narrative techniques to introduce the background of the characters and the connections between them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F4b98449a-9dfb-476f-b5fe-8067acfecbbc.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F902a4aed-7145-40a1-ad71-381228d1356b.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, in the fashion description, the origin and story of this fashion are added, telling the background of Kurumi and her best friend Viper Ning becoming enemies. This setting also attracts many players to explore the reasons why Viper Ning and Kurumi changed from best friends to enemies.</p>
<h2 id="III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative"><a href="#III-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fragmented-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative"></a>III. Advantages and Disadvantages of Fragmented Narrative</h2><p>Fragmented narrative has received widespread attention in recent years with the popularity of games such as <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Due to some of its characteristics, it has corresponding advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-Players"><a href="#Advantages-for-Players" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for Players"></a>Advantages for Players</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Extends game time and has a better new game plus experience</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative splits a lot of information into various corners of the game, and players can have a richer experience in exploration. In contrast, when experiencing linear narrative games, many players may leave the game after experiencing the main quest once, and will not open it a second time. Fragmented narrative gives players a lot of room for exploration. Players who want to piece together a more complete plot need to explore more carefully in new game plus, obtain more props and clues, enhance the player’s experience in subsequent playthroughs, and alleviate the repetition of multiple playthroughs. Players can be pleasantly surprised to discover more game details and plot connections.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High degree of freedom, players can choose the plot direction they want to explore</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative does not directly present the plot to the player like linear narrative, but lets the player explore it themselves. This gives the player a higher degree of freedom, that is, what information they want to obtain is determined by the player’s own initiative. The plot is lengthy, unimportant, or uninteresting. Content can be chosen not to be explored, and plot connections that are of great interest can be chosen to be explored first.</p>
<p>When players piece together clues, they often add a process of imagination, which allows different players to have different understandings of the game plot. Under the official setting, various understandings can be made, as long as the logic is complete and reasonable. It can become the perfect story in the player’s mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F215377a7-9834-4eab-b576-e52624005b41.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In “Elden Ring”, players are allowed to interpret the story themselves. It is not just the order of reading the story, even the internal logical order of the story is not fixed</em></p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Stronger sense of immersion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In fragmented narrative games, players not only need to complete combat levels, but also need to complete the collection and piecing together of the plot, and even some imagination. The process of exploration further enhances the player’s sense of immersion. Players need to actively recall, think, and piece together a complete plot, rather than passively accepting the instillation of cutscenes.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-for-the-Game"><a href="#Advantages-for-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Advantages for the Game"></a>Advantages for the Game</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Relatively low cost and flexible development</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of fragmented narrative can use a large amount of text bound to props, NPCs, etc., reducing the production of cutscenes and real-time rendering, thereby reducing costs. At the same time, the content of fragmented narrative is relatively discrete, and the content connection in the plot is relatively less tight. It will be more natural to modify or delete during the development process, and the overall impact on the plot is smaller.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Different players have different understandings of the plot, which will trigger higher discussion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the plot of a fragmented narrative game requires players to collect, piece together, and imagine. Players will have different understandings of the plot, and the collision of their views will cause intense discussions. Players’ reposts and discussions on social media can increase the popularity of the game and attract more fresh blood.</p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>It should be noted that some of the above advantages of fragmented narration are also double-edged swords, which may become disadvantages for different players.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Friendly to new game plus players, but not friendly to light players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The plot of the game takes a lot of time to dig out. Some places may need to be revisited, and some clues may be deeply buried. These are of course a great pleasure for players who are keen on exploring, but for some players who just want a light experience, The game burden is relatively heavier. For such players, the linear narrative movie-like plot flow experience will be better.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>High requirements for plot copywriting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fragmented narrative presents players with one point after another, but in the eyes of copywriters, it must be a rigorous logical framework. A large number of clues must be guaranteed to be free of contradictions and contain a certain amount of information. If the game is full of useless clues, players will question it as being pretentious and unintelligible.</p>
<p>If there is a deviation in the focus of the game plot, it will be difficult for players to experience the core plot that the game really wants to convey. Excellent copywriting can ensure that more players move towards the key clues and plots, and ensure the player’s experience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Higher memory cost for players</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Although many games can take out props at any time to view descriptions and clues, a large amount of text content describes the background of the story and the relationship between characters through props or NPCs, which still brings a certain memory burden to players. Players need to recall in a large number of props which props describe which characters can piece the fragments together.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Conclusion"><a href="#IV-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="IV. Conclusion"></a>IV. Conclusion</h2><p>The fragmented narrative method has become familiar to more players with the popularity of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> in recent years. Its advantages and disadvantages are obvious. Players who like this method will be very obsessed with exploring the plot, so that there are so many “Soul scholars”, “Sekiro scholars”, and “Elden Ring scholars” constantly exploring and producing content to share and discuss.</p>
<p>Optimizing the experience of light players in the plot, while ensuring the exploration experience of deep players, can allow more players to change from light to deep, and explore those mysterious worlds. Excellent fragmented narrative plots are carefully arranged by copywriters to present players with an epic story. Those games that use the name of fragmented narrative but actually have fragmented plots, far-fetched connections, and obscurity are “pretentious”.</p>

    <title>The Renaissance of Nostalgic Games - Nostalgia That&#39;s Not Necessarily Long-Lasting</title>
    <url>/2022/08/21/netease-ux-articles/news_20221128_28584_1054990/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221128/28584_1054990.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>Nostalgia is good business.</p>
<p>On June 16th, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> was officially released and achieved good results. When the theme song of the 1987 TV animation <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> is played, you will know that the main theme of this game is nostalgia. Everything in the game now seems to have a sense of age, and it can immediately take people back to the time when they were sitting in front of the TV watching cartoons or playing cartridge games years ago. Its target users are also very clear, namely the audience of the animation at that time and the arcade game players in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Now it seems that these products born for nostalgia still have countless old players paying for them, which makes more manufacturers today see this good business. We can also see that by 2022, there are more and more products that use nostalgia to attract users. So, how to use nostalgia to attract players? And why do people love “nostalgia” so much?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work"><a href="#1-How-Does-“Nostalgia”-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?"></a>1. How Does “Nostalgia” Work?</h2><p>Nowadays, players who are attracted by sentiment have a relatively high tolerance for the quality of games, but with the development and maturity of sentiment, players’ demand for the quality of such games is also rapidly increasing. Many game manufacturers that play the nostalgia card have also realized the development and changes of players’ current needs, and have begun to carry out more detailed operations for the theme of “nostalgia”. From the player’s point of view, even if they have long realized that the manufacturer is using the banner of nostalgia to make money, when they see those familiar scenes and characters, they will still involuntarily feel a surge in their hearts and open their wallets.</p>
<p>So, how do manufacturers manipulate “nostalgia”?</p>
<h3 id="Original-Flavor"><a href="#Original-Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Original Flavor"></a>Original Flavor</h3><p>In August 2019, <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> was launched, which can be said to be a milestone of the “original flavor” school. Behind the popularity, the nostalgic culture has set off another wave of trends in game media, live broadcast platforms, and video websites. The player group and the capital market have given double certification to Classic. The concept of “original flavor” has also been further consolidated in the minds of many game manufacturers. After all, before this, very few online games were willing to bring out old content from more than ten years ago almost unchanged and sell it, even if they wanted to sell it, they would carry out a series of operations such as “HD remake”, “gameplay optimization”, and “introduction of innovation”.</p>
<p>Now it seems that Classic can bring huge benefits. The rough pictures and immature designs of the original flavor not only did not expose their shortcomings, but instead became a weapon to evoke players’ feelings at the first time. While everyone complains about the imbalance and inconvenience, they don’t forget to add a sentence “It was like this back then”, and then happily eat the meal of remembering the past.</p>
<p>The success of all this also proves the feasibility of “original flavor” restoration from the side. If players are given the opportunity to play again from scratch, most people will burst out with a higher desire to consume than before, with a yearning for the past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fb31a4b1f-2848-43a5-8f58-fdab99a2e095.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Old-Formula-New-Taste"><a href="#Old-Formula-New-Taste" class="headerlink" title="Old Formula, New Taste"></a>Old Formula, New Taste</h3><p>Different from the “true original flavor” of Classic, there are also some nostalgic products that focus more on providing players with the first impression of “the same as before”, and adding new elements that meet current trends in gameplay design, functional modules, and social systems. Many of the gameplay and functions of these games are now considered to be in the category of “dead on arrival”. After years of exploration, manufacturers have also researched their own solutions that both capture the nostalgic mentality of old players and adapt to the current market.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the production team deliberately restored the previous rich scene interaction and exaggerated and humorous plot settings in the game. For example, in the previous <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> series, players could hit the manhole cover thrown by the enemy to defeat the opponent; enemies would suddenly burst out of the window from the shops on the street; when players encountered various trap scenes, they might also be crushed into slices, smashed into pieces, burned into small black figures, and even rubbed their eyes when they were splashed with sand, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F3755c316-84a4-4a3d-b804-6be5a3fb21a6.png/size/"></p>
<p>But while restoring the former flavor, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> also added a lot of new things. In terms of design, an attribute system has been added. The three attributes of range, speed, and power are different according to the characteristics of the character itself; in terms of operation, more operation commands have been added, such as double jump, dodge and other actions; in terms of gameplay, the “ultimate skill” has added an energy bar design, and a blocking system has also been introduced for monsters; in terms of social interaction, more cooperative gameplay has been added, such as combos, interactions, rescues, and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F92ec7849-718a-4d4a-9a41-5f3a39b7c283.png/size/"></p>
<p>For individual players, when this game reappears in front of them “unchanged” after many years, they will feel somewhat unclear. The players still want to play this game, but because people’s aesthetics and mentality are constantly changing, now it has put on a more “fashionable coat” and appeared in front of the players in a brand new posture, which must be more fascinating.</p>
<h3 id="Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”"><a href="#Creating-a-Social-“New-Trend”" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Social “New Trend”"></a>Creating a Social “New Trend”</h3><p>For manufacturers, longer-term nostalgia is not only efficient harvesting of feelings, but also allows themselves to become a new topic of trend. In the business of nostalgia, social attributes, as a positive factor that can connect players’ emotions and promote the spontaneous spread of the game among players’ communities, can to a certain extent amplify the symbolic marketing of nostalgia and make it a new trend for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mole Manor</em>, as a childhood memory of the post-90s generation, was originally a children’s game for elementary school to junior high school students. Therefore, when the game manufacturer relaunched this game, they needed to consider how to satisfy the feelings and attract the adult group. Based on this, the operation of <em>Mole Manor</em> mobile game is to push topics such as “working in the game”, “checking in at internet celebrity shops and internet celebrity attractions”, and “establishing a fan community” to the vast social platform. By fitting the current state of the players who have grown up, the social attributes are amplified, and a certain degree of gameplay is abandoned, leading to a wave of “nostalgic new trends”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F9bd18d2b-0d20-44e2-b0c6-45be4bbb172b.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun"><a href="#2-Is-“Nostalgia”-More-Fun" class="headerlink" title="2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?"></a>2. Is “Nostalgia” More Fun?</h2><p>In general, this type of game is still more about nostalgia than gameplay. So why is it that playing a game from many years ago feels more fun than modern games?</p>
<h3 id="Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment"><a href="#Unburdened-Pure-Enjoyment" class="headerlink" title="Unburdened Pure Enjoyment"></a>Unburdened Pure Enjoyment</h3><p>Today’s games are constantly improving in quality, and the game content is becoming more and more detailed, and the requirements for players are also increasing. When playing games, players have more information to receive and process: more refined graphics, more detailed music, more realistic animations and interactive systems. Although these elements make the game as a whole more refined and beautiful, it has to be admitted that they also bring more burden to players.</p>
<p>In other words, more delicate motion animations and more realistic sound effects bring players a “real” sense of immersion; but at the same time, the problem is that the difficulty of game operation will also increase, which requires players to adapt to the operation. In comparison, sometimes it is indeed not as good as the pure enjoyment brought by easier-to-use game operations and higher fun, which is more popular with players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F82ca5657-2dc3-43cb-ad46-7d00a042871d.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again"><a href="#Finding-the-Joy-of-Playing-with-Friends-Again" class="headerlink" title="Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again"></a>Finding the Joy of Playing with Friends Again</h3><p>The irreplaceable emotional value can help nostalgic games recall the most loyal core players. This value is partly given by the unique gameplay of the game itself, and on the other hand, it is also deeply hidden in the emotional connection of playing games with friends in the past.</p>
<p>For players, when mentioning a certain game, the biggest nostalgic memory may be around playing with friends, making friends in the game, sharing interests, and enjoying the experience of mutual competition and cooperation. So when a nostalgic game is relaunched, players can’t help but recall the happiness that this game once brought them, and they will think of the time when they left their friends in the game or cooperated with them in the process of completing tasks. These experiences allow players to have a deeper social connection with others, and naturally they will pour deeper emotions into this game, prompting them to download the game again even after so many years, and then poke the friends who played with them back then: Hey, do you want to play another round together?</p>
<h3 id="Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics"><a href="#Insisting-on-Gameplay-and-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics"></a>Insisting on Gameplay and Mechanics</h3><p>In today’s various AAA games, when the game has a set of movie-level graphics and narrative, resources must continue to tilt towards the most prominent parts of the game, such as the sense of impact, the sense of substitution, the audio-visual sensory experience, etc. to improve the quality of the game in all aspects. On the contrary, some of the gameplay and mechanics have not improved with the development of the game. Such games are like a production line, one generation after another. For most players, it may just be that the graphics and actions are more realistic, and the map is larger. The old games of the past, although the game content is not so close to reality, but because of this, the excellent old games that have been passed down are more purely because of their advanced core gameplay, which is addictive.</p>
<p>Therefore, when facing countless masterpieces, players will unconsciously feel that they want to play every game, but they don’t want to click on any game, or they want to turn it off and scroll through their phone after playing for 40 minutes. However, playing the “nostalgic” remake with a nostalgic mentality is so fond of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F22245a29-6bbe-448f-a70a-a4bfed210737.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely"><a href="#3-Childhood-is-Back-But-Not-Completely" class="headerlink" title="3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely"></a>3. Childhood is Back? But Not Completely</h2><p>“Fun, not necessarily long-lasting”, best describes the state of this type of nostalgic game. For players, their happy experience of this type of game may only be 2 hours.</p>
<p>Take <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> as an example, the game has the feeling of playing through arcade games before, but it cannot provide enough motivation for repeated play. Even if each level is made to feel uniquely “new”, due to the repetitive mechanism, if you play more than 10 levels in a row, you will still feel tired.</p>
<p>When players play, they may lose interest after playing two levels with different characters, and the gameplay lacks stamina. If you try to solve the problem of repeated play motivation through the plot, such as branch plot drive, <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> does not even have a decent main plot, and it is difficult for players to have the motivation to repeatedly play levels.</p>
<p>However, if you want to continue to get game fun, the ideal situation is to play multiplayer online with friends you know in real life. Combined with the original intention of game development, multiplayer online can also better reproduce the feeling of playing happily with friends in the living room, arcade hall and other places when you were a child. This may be the best and most correct way to open <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. Once you can’t find friends to play with, after playing a few times with random matches, you may still quickly lose motivation due to the aforementioned factors.</p>
<p>Back to what was said at the beginning, nostalgia is good business. It’s okay to make nostalgic games. What is really difficult to reproduce is the days of playing games in the past.</p>

<p>With the improvement of living standards and changes in consumption habits, games have gradually become the mainstream leisure method and social activity for consumers. In 2021, the actual sales revenue of China’s game market was 296.513 billion yuan, an increase of 17.826 billion yuan compared with the previous year, but the growth rate decreased by nearly 15% year-on-year. Affected by the epidemic and the global economy, China’s consumer confidence index has fluctuated significantly in the past two years. </p>

<p>In terms of game payment, the current game market in China presents the characteristics of “low payment rate and high payment amount”. In 2021, the number of game users in China was 666 million, a year-on-year increase of 0.22%, and the number of users is gradually saturated. The penetration rate of mobile game users reached a peak of 75.9% in 2016. Due to policy tightening and other entertainment methods such as short videos grabbing potential game users, it fell to 66.3% in 2020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F854192e8-02c5-48d0-a2d8-f7a983e7d3ea.png/size/" alt="Simple Calculation Formula for Mobile Game Revenue"></p>
<p>Young people, mainly Generation Z, will gradually become the mainstream group of game consumption. “Pursuing fashion”, “expressing self-personality” and “focusing on emotions” are all their consumption labels. To sum up, there are four obvious characteristics of the consumption upgrade phenomenon of young consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the “low-desire society”, consumption is polarized: rationalization of rigid demand and high frequency of spiritual demand;</li>
<li>Consumption upgrade enters the 2.0 era: from material consumption upgrade to spiritual consumption upgrade, users are more likely to be touched by feelings and pay for the spiritual world; pursue refinement and aesthetics; improve their own literacy through consumption, etc.;</li>
<li>Cultural belonging and national trend identity are increasingly prominent</li>
<li>Consumption circles in urban and rural areas and between generations are increasingly solidifie.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F9a2a7d35-d446-4076-a038-776b459453ce.png/size/" alt="Generation Z Online Consumption Survey (Have you ever had the following payment behaviors)"></p>
<p>The consumption upgrade characteristics presented by this new consumer group will also lead the trend of changes in the game industry, including changes in game pricing power (consumption is tilted towards high-quality game products, paying more attention to the multi-dimensional and deep-level added value brought by the product such as experience, feeling, and atmosphere), changes in game mode (“content + form” games and strong rule games with storylines as the main body), changes in integration paths (“game +” and “+ game” forms) and changes in experience methods (breakthrough of circle layers and fragmented time game collaboration).</p>
<p>In other words, the current demographic dividend of the domestic game industry has receded, but in the future, with the increase in China’s per capita disposable income and the strengthening of young people’s willingness to pay for online entertainment, the industry’s payment rate still has a large room for improvement. Next, this article will start from the perspective of consumer psychology to talk about why you are willing to pay in the game, and what factors will affect your payment decision.</p>
<h2 id="1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention"><a href="#1-Consumer-Psychology-and-Purchase-Intention" class="headerlink" title="1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention"></a>1. Consumer Psychology and Purchase Intention</h2><p>Consumer psychology mainly studies the psychological phenomena and behavior patterns of consumers in consumption activities. Simply put, consumer action &#x3D; consumer psychology + consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Common consumer psychology includes seeking practicality (the use value of goods &amp; services), seeking beauty (the artistic value and appreciation value of goods), seeking convenience (convenient to buy or carry), comparison (satisfying curiosity and not falling behind), herd mentality and so on.</p>
<p>Purchase intention is the possibility that consumers will buy a certain product or service, and the probability of being willing to take a specific purchase behavior is high or low. It is the subjective tendency of consumers to choose a specific product, and it is an important indicator for predicting consumer behavior. Factors that affect purchase intention are often:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer personality characteristics:</strong> including demographics (gender&#x2F;age&#x2F;occupation&#x2F;income&#x2F;education level) and specific factors (such as the purchase intention of food is related to the consumer’s health status);</li>
<li><strong>Product internal cues:</strong> attributes related to the use value of the product, such as use value, quality characteristics, etc. That is, consumers are to obtain the products they need to meet their own needs, which is the main driving force for consumers to take purchasing behavior;</li>
<li><strong>Product external cues:</strong> relative to internal cues, external factors unrelated to the product’s own attributes, such as price, brand, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Consumption situation factors:</strong> Consumers’ purchasing decisions will change with changes in the situation factors they are in, such as store design, surrounding environment, salesperson performance, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> When the level of purchasing power is constant, market demand is a function of purchase intention. From a macroeconomic perspective, the lack of purchase intention of residents within a certain period of time is due to the decline in the growth of residents’ immediate income and expected income.</li>
</ul>
<p>For consumers, the purchase decision is usually a progressive thinking: whether it can meet my needs, whether I have enough money to buy, and whether it is affordable among similar choices.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the real economy &amp; e-commerce, there are many common situations related to consumer behavior and psychology.</p>
<h3 id="Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’"><a href="#Case-1-Set-Membership-Prices-Through-the-‘Decoy-Effect’" class="headerlink" title="Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’"></a>Case 1: Set Membership Prices Through the ‘Decoy Effect’</h3><p>When making decisions, consumers rarely buy directly without comparison. At this time, in order for consumers to make purchase decisions better and faster, merchants often provide a “decoy” for the target product to encourage consumers to buy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Ff4a929d9-dd36-4e18-b194-97ad2ba2b8c7.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Case-2-Pay-Attention-to-the-‘Ambiguity-Effect’-to-Promote-Ice-Breaking-Consumption"><a href="#Case-2-Pay-Attention-to-the-‘Ambiguity-Effect’-to-Promote-Ice-Breaking-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="Case 2: Pay Attention to the ‘Ambiguity Effect’ to Promote Ice-Breaking Consumption"></a>Case 2: Pay Attention to the ‘Ambiguity Effect’ to Promote Ice-Breaking Consumption</h3><p>People tend to choose clear options and avoid unknown options. If users don’t understand your product, or a particular feature, they won’t choose it. If you want to design a mall gift package for the game, you need to give players a full understanding, especially for those new players who are just starting to experience the game, what props they can get in the gift package, and what price advantages they have, need to be fully described.</p>
<h3 id="Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props"><a href="#Case-3-Use-the-‘Anchoring-Effect’-to-Highlight-the-Value-of-Props" class="headerlink" title="Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props"></a>Case 3: Use the ‘Anchoring Effect’ to Highlight the Value of Props</h3><p>When people make judgments about something&#x2F;someone, they are easily dominated by first impressions or the first information they receive, just like an anchor sinking to the bottom of the sea, fixing people’s thoughts somewhere. For example, if a consumer sees the price of a certain product for the first time, then the price of this first impression will have a huge impact on her.</p>
<p>In the game, the pricing of the mall often plays the role of “anchor”. Perhaps the sales of direct purchases in the mall are not high, but when the event gift package is launched, players will compare the price in the gift package with the mall pricing, thus feeling cheap and affordable.</p>
<h2 id="2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation"><a href="#2-Game-Motivation-and-Payment-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation"></a>2. Game Motivation and Payment Motivation</h2><p>Currently, more and more people believe that games are closer to a service industry. Players experience the game, in fact, they are enjoying the service content designed by the game developers and paying for it. Not only the game play design itself, its social atmosphere, operation mode, and economic system are all part of the player’s evaluation. With the weakening and disappearance of the demographic dividend, the game industry has turned to competition for existing players. Doing a good job in the game and doing a good job in experience is also more important for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>To understand players’ payment motivation, we can start by understanding players’ game motivation. Many organizations and individuals have studied players’ game motivation, mainly out of personal self-satisfaction, social needs, etc. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F5b51d3f6-b095-41b8-ba47-31e534eed36c.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In order to meet the game needs of different types of players, the paid content in the game has become increasingly diverse, and players with different motivations can find the one that suits their needs in the game. For example, players whose main game motivation is “achievement” are more likely to pay to achieve the goals of the achievement&#x2F;collection system; players who value “social” have a greater willingness to buy appearance items; players who want to “crush others” are more interested in ability-enhancing paid content.</p>
<h2 id="3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment"><a href="#3-Factors-Affecting-In-Game-Payment" class="headerlink" title="3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment"></a>3. Factors Affecting In-Game Payment</h2><p>Game products can be divided into hardware products (game consoles, accessories, etc.) and software products (online games, mobile games, etc.). Here, we will mainly discuss game software products, especially the payment design in non-buyout games, that is, the payment content related to the game itself.</p>
<p>Games are no longer a “one-shot deal”. Paying attention to the player’s full-process experience in the game, putting users first, and improving user experience are one of the tenets of most game manufacturers. Combining factors such as game motivation, game design, and consumer psychology, we can also extract some factors that may affect players’ payment in the game, so as to better understand why players choose to pay in the game, and what kind of game experience they hope to obtain through payment. In addition to the theme characteristics of players (gender, age, education, etc.), the following factors are worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment"><a href="#Social-Entertainment-Self-Fulfillment" class="headerlink" title="Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment"></a>Social Entertainment &amp; Self-Fulfillment</h3><p>In an analysis of the online game consumption behavior of college players, researchers found that “entertainment and sociality” is the biggest influencing factor. Players are eager to make new friends, maintain and deepen existing friendships while enjoying online games. At the same time, they hope to gain a sense of existence and achievement that cannot be satisfied in the real world through self-participation.</p>
<p>In addition, players also hope that the game can entertain themselves and relieve pressure. They hope to express themselves through better dressing&#x2F;strength, or show their economic strength and attract attention.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Practical-Value"><a href="#In-Game-Practical-Value" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Practical Value"></a>In-Game Practical Value</h3><p>Most in-game paid content has practical value in the game, such as improving character abilities, saving game time, accumulating game resources, facilitating certain game activities, helping to complete certain tasks, etc. For these reasons, players may take payment actions.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Quality-Itself"><a href="#Game-Quality-Itself" class="headerlink" title="Game Quality Itself"></a>Game Quality Itself</h3><p>According to the statistics of Gamma Data, among the top 250 games in China in 2019, only 15.3% were “obviously innovative” types, but they contributed 62.3% of the total revenue of these games. Chinese players are obviously more willing to pay for games with excellent graphics and innovative gameplay. With the tightening of policies, some homogenous games with ordinary graphics, monotonous content and gameplay, and short player life cycle value will gradually disappear. The increase in the proportion of high-quality games will hopefully drive the overall ARPU value of the industry.</p>
<p><em>ARPU, that is, average revenue per user, is an indicator used by operators to measure the revenue from each end user.</em></p>
<p>Whether the game is innovative and refined enough (including picture quality, gameplay content, story theme, game style, plot characters, etc.), whether it is easy to get started, and whether the quality of related services is timely and effective will affect players’ payment decisions.</p>
<h3 id="External-Market-Impact"><a href="#External-Market-Impact" class="headerlink" title="External Market Impact"></a>External Market Impact</h3><p>The game industry is not operating independently. Players also pay attention to the legal and policy environment, such as the anti-addiction regulations for minors that manufacturers have been working to optimize in recent years; marketing such as celebrity effects, IP linkage, etc.; and hardware configuration, players’ network speed, and the dependence of game products on device configuration.</p>
<h3 id="Consumption-Preferences"><a href="#Consumption-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Consumption Preferences"></a>Consumption Preferences</h3><p>Game payment is no different from other payment behaviors. As consumers, players will first consider the economic value of their content: whether the price is affordable, whether it is reasonable, and whether it is affordable; some game prop content also has a certain ‘investment value’, and players consider whether they can sell it at a higher price in the future; there will also be some players who regard game payment as ‘one of the necessary game processes’.</p>
<h3 id="Other-Payment-Experiences"><a href="#Other-Payment-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Other Payment Experiences"></a>Other Payment Experiences</h3><p>Game payment can also learn from the experience of e-commerce payment. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of website speed (purchase process): As long as the waiting time exceeds three seconds, 57% of consumers will give up browsing the webpage, and 80% of consumers will not return to the website;</li>
<li>Overall website design (payment design UI): 92.6% of consumers said that visual enjoyment is the main factor affecting purchasing decisions, and they will decide whether to consume in just 1 and a half minutes;</li>
<li>Price discrimination: In the口碑崩盘 (kǒu bēi bēng pán - reputation collapse) incident encountered by the game “Invisible Guardian”, “inconsistent pricing” triggered a lot of negative reviews from players.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F897199a2-e97a-45c3-8c3b-13f3567b59e7.png/size/" alt="Selected Reviews of &quot;Invisible Guardian&quot; - Steam Version"></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In general, paying in a game is not a one-way request, but providing high-quality services to meet the needs of players. Game as a Service (GAAS) on the one hand means that the game is no longer a one-time purchase for consumers, but a longer-term participation, and it is a commitment by game developers to provide players with continuous operation and continuous updates; on the other hand, it also requires developers to pay attention to the full-process and all-round experience of players in the game journey, and continuously polish products with the goal of “providing a better game user experience”.</p>

    <title>How to Read Minds Through the Eyes Using Eye Tracking in Game Research</title>
    <url>/2022/08/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20221128_28584_1055096/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20221128/28584_1055096.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In user research, researchers often encounter this situation: a player, after experiencing a process, cannot answer any questions during the follow-up interview: Was there this feature? Did I perform this operation? Why did I do this at that time? Whenever this happens, researchers feel a tinge of helplessness, wishing they could read minds at this moment.</p>
<p>Once players forget details, making it impossible to describe their behavior, the problems observed by the user researcher may not be solved. Fortunately, eye-tracking testing, as an objective measurement method, can measure players’ pure experience responses, supplement players’ physiological response data, and combine with traditional subjective research, which can, to a certain extent, avoid some biases caused by players’ subjective feedback. So, from the perspective of user research practice, how can visual attention data be applied to product design and user experience research?</p>
<h2 id="1-Principles-and-Characteristics-of-Eye-Movement"><a href="#1-Principles-and-Characteristics-of-Eye-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1. Principles and Characteristics of Eye Movement"></a>1. Principles and Characteristics of Eye Movement</h2><h3 id="Player-Attention-Distribution-Can-Be-Derived-from-Gaze-Point-Movement-Data"><a href="#Player-Attention-Distribution-Can-Be-Derived-from-Gaze-Point-Movement-Data" class="headerlink" title="Player Attention Distribution Can Be Derived from Gaze Point Movement Data"></a>Player Attention Distribution Can Be Derived from Gaze Point Movement Data</h3><p>Eye Movement is the process of the eyeball discovering, fixating, and tracking visual stimuli through movement. Eye tracking, which sounds very sophisticated, from observing the player’s eyes to reading the player’s mind, can actually be understood in two steps:</p>
<p>First, the prompt is right in front of you, where exactly are they looking? In other words, how do we measure the player’s eye movements?</p>
<p>The answer is Gaze Point. Modern eye-tracking instruments can calculate the movement of the eyeball through infrared light reflection, and we can see in real time where the player’s gaze point is and what they are looking at. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F4ec35219-213f-4253-9c28-66dad0d2c908.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Schematic Diagram of Eye Movement Gaze Point</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Second, they clearly saw the prompt, where is their attention actually?</p>
<p>In fact, the player’s eye movements and their attention distribution are closely related. By observing eye movement trajectories and behaviors, we can还原(huányuán - restore, reconstruct) the reasons why players did not operate in time, such as more urgent incentives (monsters rushing towards them, pickups not far away).</p>
<p>Simply put, eye tracking is to display the test subject’s gaze point on the screen in real time, and present this performance in the form of data afterwards; researchers or products can intuitively understand what information the test subject looked at, what they didn’t look at, how long they looked at a certain piece of information, etc. It can be used as direct evidence for interface and prompt optimization.</p>
<h3 id="Eye-Movement-Research-Can-Supplement-Objective-Behavioral-Data"><a href="#Eye-Movement-Research-Can-Supplement-Objective-Behavioral-Data" class="headerlink" title="Eye Movement Research Can Supplement Objective Behavioral Data"></a>Eye Movement Research Can Supplement Objective Behavioral Data</h3><p>At first glance, eye movement seems to be able to obtain a lot of detailed data, but what are its advantages or differences compared with commonly used research methods? As a kind of behavioral data measured by technology, eye movement can solve the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The reading cost of measurement results is too high:</strong> Eye movement data can be intuitively presented with a heat map, which greatly reduces the reading cost of the original data, and even people who have not been exposed to eye movement can easily read it;</li>
<li><strong>Players subjectively speculate on behavioral details:</strong> Through eye movement data, the situation where players recall and explain specific details is avoided, preventing players from hypothesizing details afterwards;</li>
<li><strong>The experimenter needs to frequently interrupt the process:</strong> Using other methods, the experimenter may need to frequently interrupt the player to ask for details of the experience, while eye movement can ensure that the player is tested without interference, especially suitable for scenarios that emphasize immersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The limitations of eye movement are also very obvious - in essence, eye movement obtains behavioral data and cannot provide explanatory information about the cause of player behavior. In order to understand the complete link of players’ “behavior-eye movement-motivation-cause”, it is often necessary to add post-test follow-up, ask players’ subjective attitudes and experience, and supplement with demographic characteristics and related experience, in order to obtain relatively complete research insights.</p>
<h2 id="2-Commonly-Used-Eye-Movement-Indicators-in-Practical-Applications"><a href="#2-Commonly-Used-Eye-Movement-Indicators-in-Practical-Applications" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly Used Eye Movement Indicators in Practical Applications"></a>2. Commonly Used Eye Movement Indicators in Practical Applications</h2><p>As mentioned above, the data obtained by eye movement methods has a very high granularity and is very comprehensive, and various types of analysis can be realized according to the needs of researchers. In user research practice, there are three types of data that are frequently used (taking Tobii Pro Lab analysis software as an example):</p>
<h3 id="Eye-Movement-Video-High-Analysis-Efficiency-Can-Discover-More-Than-80-of-Problems"><a href="#Eye-Movement-Video-High-Analysis-Efficiency-Can-Discover-More-Than-80-of-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Eye Movement Video: High Analysis Efficiency, Can Discover More Than 80% of Problems"></a>Eye Movement Video: High Analysis Efficiency, Can Discover More Than 80% of Problems</h3><p>Eye movement video is a screen recording of the player’s experience process + the player’s real-time eye movement gaze point data. Through the software, researchers can clearly see the landing point of each gaze of the player. By watching the video, researchers can restore the changes in the player’s attention at any time during the test, which is the simplest and most efficient way of eye movement indicators. In specific use, researchers can see: where the player looked, where they didn’t look, what content they were more concerned about, and the order of attention.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, when a player was experiencing the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> novice tutorial, because of personal operation, they did not see the AR prompt text, resulting in not using the “Sprint” button for a long time. The eye movement video allows the experimenter to intuitively identify that the player did not operate as expected here, and focus on the impact caused by this in the subsequent game process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F5b6ab7a3-9576-478e-8a46-be80c6b4fc92.gif/size/"></p>

The longer (more times) the player gazes, the more it is displayed as red on the heat map, emphasizing the overall situation and relative density of attention. The gaze plot can show the order and trajectory of all the player’s gaze points. This indicator is mainly used for the verification of existing interface design, and the usage scenario is usually to study relatively static area combinations. </p>

<p>For example, in the picture above, when observing the player’s understanding of the merchant tutorial, it can be seen from the heat map that the player pays extra attention to the merchant sign on the map (the red highlighted area in the picture above), and from the trajectory map, it can be seen that the player looks at the text and video对照(duìzhào - in comparison) (the numbers of the gaze points in the figure below).</p>
<h3 id="Quantitative-Indicators-Time-to-First-Fixation-and-Fixation-Duration-are-Most-Commonly-Used"><a href="#Quantitative-Indicators-Time-to-First-Fixation-and-Fixation-Duration-are-Most-Commonly-Used" class="headerlink" title="Quantitative Indicators - Time to First Fixation and Fixation Duration are Most Commonly Used"></a>Quantitative Indicators - Time to First Fixation and Fixation Duration are Most Commonly Used</h3><p>Quantitative indicators can be exported through software, and the obtainable indicator data is divided into Fixation, Visit, Saccade and other series of data. These indicators are often used for quantitative user behavior research. If necessary, the most commonly used and easy-to-use ones are the following two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixation Duration:</strong> That is, the duration of the player’s gaze within a certain period of time. It is generally understood as the player’s degree of interest. The longer the fixation duration, the more interested the player is in the corresponding position.</li>
<li><strong>Time to First Fixation:</strong> That is, the time when the first fixation occurs. It can be seen whether the player pays attention to the content in the first place and the time spent. According to the time to first fixation, we can analyze the cause of the player’s time consumption, the distribution of stimulation points, etc., so as to adjust the prompt position, intensity and other related UI design elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above three types of indicators have their own focus and can complement each other. The recommended analysis method is: first watch the eye movement video to find possible problems; then use heat maps and gaze plots to visually compare specific problems; if necessary, in-depth analysis can be carried out through quantitative data.</p>

Combining player behavior, eye movement, and interface information can reveal problems.</p>
<p>The following is a player experiencing the novice tutorial of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on console. After defeating the enemy, the player does not know what to do, walks around randomly for a period of time, suddenly releases the Y skill once, and then enters the next stage. Through eye movement, we can find that in this stage, the player only sees the prompt requirement in the upper left corner of the screen at the end, resulting in not achieving the task goal and getting stuck. From this, we can judge that this player did not find the task prompt in the first place as expected, and the researcher may need to further verify the existing UI design for repeated testing. </p>

<h3 id="Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Players"><a href="#Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Players" class="headerlink" title="Comparative Analysis Through Different Players"></a>Comparative Analysis Through Different Players</h3><p>Through comparison, we can also use certain player attributes as variables to see the characteristics of a certain type of player group and the problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>For example, in the eye-tracking test of the mobile game <em>Meteor Butterfly Sword</em>, experienced players are familiar with the game UI and task flow, so their eye movement trajectory can be used as a reference for players in use. Comparing it with the eye movement of new players, we can find the difference in attention between novices and experienced players. </p>

<p><em>《Meteor Butterfly Sword》 Mobile Game Novice&#x2F;Experienced Player Battle Level Three-Star Task Eye Movement Heat Map and Table</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It can be seen from the eye movement data (the numbers in the figure below indicate the number of fixations (time to first fixation)) that experienced players will pay attention to the requirements of the three-star task from the beginning, while novices do not pay attention to it throughout the process; experienced players pay attention to it, indicating that this is a relatively important goal when clearing the level, while new players do not see it, indicating that the information is not conspicuous enough when used for the first time. By comparing the focus of new and experienced players, it is helpful for the product to adjust the problems in terms of player onboarding.</p>
<h3 id="Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Materials"><a href="#Comparative-Analysis-Through-Different-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Comparative Analysis Through Different Materials"></a>Comparative Analysis Through Different Materials</h3><p>We can also discover the similarities and differences in player behavior through the comparative analysis of different materials. This method can be used for the comparison of similar processes.</p>
<p>Taking the video teaching in the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> novice tutorial as an example, players will experience the “Merchant” and “Whirlwind” tutorials (both of which are in the form of text + dynamic video). A certain player showed that he carefully watched the previous video, but did not pay attention to the latter video at all, but the final result was the same - the player’s actual operation was very smooth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F3dbafbc2-ae68-4b3d-8473-1244358a8acd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Gaze Plot - Merchant Tutorial (Left) and Whirlwind Tutorial (Right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Why does this happen? Through the player’s attention to the content of the page, we found that in the Whirlwind tutorial, there is a description of the display content of the small map, and the player does not need to watch the video to know the approximate style of the icon; while in the Merchant tutorial, the text description does not prompt the icon style, which leads to the above eye movement behavior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2Fdc3817c1-e657-496c-aeee-abee839dd166.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221128%2F2612aebe-9ad1-4d89-9922-8c767a478da0.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Eye movement is behavioral data, which can complement traditional interviews. Through eye movement videos, visualizations, etc., researchers can accurately and meticulously identify and analyze problems. Eye tracking can not only be used directly for analysis, but also can be combined with experimental design for targeted exploration.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, eye tracking, like other user experience research methods, requires a clear research plan, reasonable and measurable assumptions for the problems to be explored, and targeted player interviews after the test, in order to draw convincing conclusions and form inspiring insights. In user research work, any technical means are only auxiliary. Understanding the player’s motivation, needs, and cognitive process, experiencing and understanding with empathy, is the so-called “mind reading”.</p>

<h2 id="1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-“Little-Red-Dot”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games"></a>1. The “Little Red Dot” in Games</h2><p>“Red dot notifications,” as a simple and eye-catching reminder, are ubiquitous on today’s smart device platforms. It can attract everyone’s attention with a strong visual presentation in the interface, convey the content of the prompt information, especially in the multi-level menu jump, it can also clearly guide the user, and it is the key to attracting users to obtain information. It can be seen that the role of the little red dot is self-evident. There is a big role hidden in the small red dot. In fact, “little red dot” is our popular and vivid term, and its official name is “Badge.” So, what is a badge?</p>
<p>A badge refers to a red dot, number, or text that usually appears in the upper right corner of an icon or text, indicating that there is new content or information to be processed. Its purpose is to guide users to operate and increase clicks, thereby increasing business exposure. A small number of red dots can provide effective information prompts for everyone, but when red dots appear all over the screen, it will become a disaster for obsessive-compulsives.</p>
<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Mobile-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones"></a>Little Red Dots in Mobile Phones</h3><p>There are many theories about the origin of the little red dot badge, but the most widely accepted theory is that the badge originated from the BlackBerry mobile phone system. In 2009, in the 9700 series mobile phones launched by BlackBerry, a small red dot with an asterisk (*) appeared in its system. Later, in 2013, Apple used the small red dot in its system and registered related patents. Since then, the small red dot has been carried forward in the iPhone. Later, the Android system also adopted the visual presentation of the “little red dot”. Until today, we have become accustomed to the appearance of the little red dot. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fec95d72c-1d82-4e54-ad14-c11aeacc7017.png/size/" alt="BlackBerry 9700 Series Phone"></p>
<h3 id="Little-Red-Dots-in-Games"><a href="#Little-Red-Dots-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Little Red Dots in Games"></a>Little Red Dots in Games</h3><p>In games, in order to effectively remind players to pay attention to function activation, content updates, reward collection, mail notifications, and other information, game developers are also very fond of small red dots, wishing that the interface was full of red dots. Even for players, playing games every day is to regularly clear the refreshed small red dots.</p>
<p>Of course, in the game, the more red dots, the better. If red dots appear all over the screen, it will make players feel confused, unable to distinguish the importance of the information conveyed, and confused. It will also strongly force players to eliminate a large number of red dots, causing players to be bored and reducing the game experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F8fee83ee-bf20-4e3b-bf32-47ec0a30f587.png/size/" alt="Onmyoji Game Interface"><br><em>《Onmyoji》 Mobile Game Interface</em></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot"><a href="#2-The-Big-Role-of-the-Little-Red-Dot" class="headerlink" title="2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot"></a>2. The Big Role of the Little Red Dot</h2><h3 id="From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-perspective-of-the-game-itself-Why-have-a-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?"></a>From the perspective of the game itself: Why have a little red dot?</h3><p>The eye-catching way of the small red dot can undoubtedly quickly attract the attention of players. From the perspective of the game itself, it can not only effectively improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition, but also guide players to perform expected behaviors. For players, the appearance of the small red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, and the “discomfort” it brings will greatly attract players and induce them to click to eliminate the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reminder and attraction:</strong> Improve the efficiency of players’ information acquisition</p>
<ul>
<li>In the game, the use of small red dots is mainly for reminders and attraction. Reminders refer to promptly delivering new messages, gameplays, updates, and other information in the game to players, allowing players to obtain new mail information, notifications, discover new costumes, skills, equipment, attributes, and other content. Attraction is to further guide players to click to increase clicks and exposure on the basis of basic reminder functions.</li>
<li>At the same time, because players’ game time is becoming more and more fragmented, developers must provide players with more convenient ways to use small red dots to allow players to obtain more content within a limited time, reducing invalid exploration and searching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Guidance and expectation:</strong> Guide players to perform expected behavior operations</p>
<ul>
<li>Another important role of the small red dot is to guide players to perform expected behavior operations. In the game, if the guidance is done well, it can allow players to obtain a smooth experience, but if it is not done well, it will make players feel bored and irritable. For example, in the hero interface of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a “plus sign” shaped red badge is used in the upper right corner of each hero to allow players to click to view new heroes and updated costumes, equipment, etc. of heroes, guiding players to click step by step to view updated content and understand the details of items. After the player clicks to view, the red dot will disappear, which can effectively guide the player to obtain information, and also clear the “red dot” in time, so that the player has a clear and smooth experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot"><a href="#From-the-player’s-perspective-Why-deal-with-the-little-red-dot" class="headerlink" title="From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?"></a>From the player’s perspective: Why deal with the little red dot?</h3><p>From the player’s point of view, why do players always can’t help but click on the little red dot?</p>
<p>This is mainly because the appearance of the red dot breaks the balance of information transmission, distinguishing and enhancing the primary and secondary relationship of information. At the same time, it brings players the discomfort of breaking the stability, so it will force players to “deal” with the small red dot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Break the balance of information transmission</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The principle of similarity mentions that objects with common elements appear to be more related, usually manifested as visual elements such as shape, color, and size. We also tend to regard similar objects as a group when observing things. When there is no small red dot in the normal state, the information is in equilibrium. The appearance of the small red dot makes it different from other content in the group, breaking the original information balance, efficiently presenting information to players, and allowing players to quickly obtain information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bring “discomfort” to players</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of small red dots in the game can be said to take advantage of the player’s obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology. When there is disharmony, abnormality, and other content in the interface, it will make players feel bored, and they will try to clear and correct these “errors”. The “discomfort” brought to players will greatly attract players, making them actively click to eliminate it, and also complete the game guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”"><a href="#3-How-to-Design-the-“Little-Red-Dot”" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?"></a>3. How to Design the “Little Red Dot”?</h2><p>After understanding the origin and role of the little red dot, we will next explore how to better design and utilize the little red dot in the game interface to provide players with an efficient, smooth, and comfortable experience.</p>
<h3 id="Reduce-Excessive-Appearance"><a href="#Reduce-Excessive-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Excessive Appearance"></a>Reduce Excessive Appearance</h3><p>The little red dot is not a panacea. When there are many small red dots in the interface, the red dot loses its original meaning. Red dots all over the screen will make players confused. Perhaps some players will click on them one by one under the guidance of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but more players will choose to ignore the existence of red dots, and even feel disgusted. Therefore, the excessive appearance of red dots should be reduced in the interface, the number of displays should be controlled, and key information should be selected for prompting, so that the small red dot can show its due value.</p>
<h3 id="One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate"><a href="#One-time-and-Easy-to-Eliminate" class="headerlink" title="One-time and Easy to Eliminate"></a>One-time and Easy to Eliminate</h3><p>Many players encounter situations in the game where they cannot eliminate the small red dot, which will cause them to feel extremely irritable. Therefore, in the design, players need to be able to easily eliminate the red dot and make it disappear with a simple operation, restoring a concise and refreshing interface. In some games, this is ignored, and the red dot that is always on will greatly affect the player’s game experience. The red dot elimination principle should meet the following 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-time reminder, disappears after clicking</li>
<li>Click to disappear, reset after re-login</li>
<li>Can be cleared when conditions are met</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path"><a href="#Ensure-a-Clear-Guidance-Path" class="headerlink" title="Ensure a Clear Guidance Path"></a>Ensure a Clear Guidance Path</h3><p>When there are new content updates or reminders for players to collect rewards, it is necessary to use red dots to attract players and guide them to the final page. In the process, if there is a guidance break or a sudden stop, it will cause players to be confused. Therefore, when using small red dots, it is necessary to ensure the clarity of the guidance path. For example, in the reward collection guidance of <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, the appearance of red dots well guides the reward collection path. When the player enters the final page, the red dot disappears, and the collection of the gift package is displayed in the form of special effects. When the player takes the wrong path, the red dot will appear again to correct the player’s path. </p>

<h3 id="Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style"><a href="#Performance-in-Line-with-the-Game-Style" class="headerlink" title="Performance in Line with the Game Style"></a>Performance in Line with the Game Style</h3><p>In the game, the appearance of the small red dot provides players with clear information reminders, but in different scenes, the form of the small red dot should also be different. Of course, no matter what form it appears in, it should have a strong visual effect. In the design, it should also be considered comprehensively from three aspects: color, shape, and form of expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Not just red<ul>
<li>Usually, the appearance of small red dots is mainly red. This is because red will give people a sense of warning, danger, and eye-catching, and it can form a strong contrast with other information, thereby attracting players’ attention. Therefore, designing small red dots in red can well attract players to click.</li>
<li>Of course, in games, due to the different styles and theme colors of different games, the use of “small red dots” can also be flexibly designed. For example, in <em>Knives Out</em>, the theme color of the game is mainly yellow, so in order to fit the theme color, yellow is also used in the design of the “small red dot”. At the same time, the bright yellow can also attract the attention of players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 Interface</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Diverse styles<ul>
<li>Also in the choice of shape, especially in games, it is not limited to circles. In the design of the shape, it can be set according to the worldview and style of the game itself, making the interface more holistic. For example, the “small red dot” in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em> adopts a pentagonal design, which is selected from the packaging of candies in the original work; the “small red dot” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> adopts the form of a “+” to indicate update reminders; in <em>Onmyoji</em>, although the red dot method is also used, its shape is integrated with the game style, and it is also more unified in the interface.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F5068f15f-511b-4687-b409-a68f735b195b.png/size/" alt="Harry Potter: Magic Awakened &#x2F; Naraka: Bladepoint &#x2F; Onmyoji"></p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form of expression:</strong> Vivid and image<ul>
<li>In terms of expression, the shape of the small red dot can also be more vivid and image. The combination of pictures and text, the presentation of text, and the performance of micro-motion effects can all enrich the style of the “small red dot”. For example, in <em>UNO!</em>, the small red dot becomes the form of a bubble, and an exclamation mark is displayed in it to indicate information reminders, which can easily attract the attention of players; in the <em>Onmyoji</em> store, the text form is directly used as a badge, which also effectively conveys new information; in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em>, the friend badge adopts the form of mail and is presented in the form of micro-dynamic shaking, which can also vividly display the reminder information in front of the player, thereby attracting the player to click. The diverse forms of expression make the “small red dot” more emotional and interesting, and it is also easier to bring players a pleasant experience.</li>

<h3 id="Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click"><a href="#Allow-Players-to-Eliminate-with-One-Click" class="headerlink" title="Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click"></a>Allow Players to Eliminate with One Click</h3><p>In the game, in order to allow players to get a good experience, the function design that allows players to eliminate red dot prompts with one click can be described as a boon for obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. In the interactive interface, you can design an interactive button to eliminate red dot prompts in a more conspicuous position, or you can put it in the settings for players to choose the red dot message reminders that need to be eliminated. One-click elimination of red dot prompts is not to close it once and for all, cutting off players’ reminders to get messages, but to provide players with more choices, slow down players’ irritability experience, and red dot prompts will also appear again after re-login to the game (but one-click elimination will also inevitably bring some mistakes).</p>
<p>Of course, when designing the interaction of the one-click elimination button, it can also be more interesting. For example, as early as 2014, QQ added the “drag and disappear” interaction method to eliminate red dots, which is both convenient and interesting, and at the same time can avoid the embarrassment caused by one-click elimination.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, the little red dot has become an effective way of information reminders in the game. Although different forms will be adopted in different functions and usage scenarios, the design of small red dots in games should be more efficient and friendly, effectively reminding players to obtain information. It should not appear casually in order to cope or excessively highlight certain information, which will eventually lead to the proliferation of red dots, causing confusion to players and affecting the player’s game experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, when designing the “little red dot”, you should also consider the necessity of the appearance of the red dot, as well as the consistent form of expression with the game style, and increase the fun of the “little red dot” dynamic effect performance in appropriate circumstances, so that the small red dot can play a big role, truly and efficiently transmit information for players, and reduce players’ boredom with the “red dot”.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do we love playing games? Because they provide us with the opportunity to satisfy our inner psychological needs. For MMORPG players, satisfying social needs is an important factor that drives them to the virtual world. In the joyful world of resolving grudges with a smile, we can choose to play completely different roles and interact with others. “Being yourself” or “no longer being yourself” are both choices. And the premise of “playing” is “personalization.” Fashion appearance is one of the most direct personalization systems in the game.</p>
<p>How players dress up their characters is also a part of self-expression in social interaction. Therefore, players’ needs for fashion appearances in the game may also reflect their expectations for the image presented by the characters they control in social interaction. So, in MMO games, what is the relationship between players’ choices of fashion appearances and players’ self-expression in the virtual world?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”"><a href="#1-“Compared-to-Being-Good-Looking-I’m-More-Unique”" class="headerlink" title="1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”"></a>1. “Compared to Being Good-Looking, I’m More Unique”</h2><p>With the iteration of the overall quality of games, the character images in MMO games are becoming more and more refined and beautiful. Players also have more methods and channels to pursue beauty and individuality. For example, in <em>Revelation M</em>, players can customize the colors and patterns of certain fashions, presenting different styles with the same tailoring and design through their own thinking. Players can also trade in the store and earn income by selling their creations. </p>

<p><em>Revelation M’s Stylist System (top) and Player Styling Store (bottom)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In such a highly free customization system, some players have begun to pursue another extreme of aesthetics (as shown below). The left side is created by players through dyeing and printing on the basis of the clothing on the right side. Why do players pursue to emulate the “Shamate” (杀马特 - shā mǎ tè, a Chinese subculture known for its extravagant and often garish fashion) style, and even take photos and share them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F2bd33211-f437-4ca0-90c8-fed1d48ef591.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Player-customized Shamate style (left) and the corresponding original clothing (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Because the “Shamate” style does not mean that players lack aesthetics, but is a way for some players to pursue social recognition.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, personalization is an important prerequisite for social interaction. In <em>Revelation M</em>, where even NPCs are handsome men and beautiful women, “good-looking” does have a thousand faces. But when everyone is as beautiful as a banished immortal, the extreme <em>tuwei</em> (土味 - tǔ wèi, meaning “rustic” or “tacky”) is more eye-catching and more impressive. This kind of behavior is no different from the pursuit of “riding a server-limited mount and swaggering through the streets”. Both are self-expression in social interaction. The only difference is that the former tries to seek recognition by showing personality, because such a dress conveys the message “I am very interesting, I have a personality”.</p>
<p>In fact, after the aesthetic significance is greatly reduced, it is not difficult to see that such a dress is completely for social needs, and it may lose its meaning if it is not seen&#x2F;commented on by others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F62121856-dac6-4362-a0c0-e005e664a1e7.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Revelation M players in groups, all dressed in Shamate style</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is worth noting that there is a subtle difference between such personalized customization and what is called “not good-looking”. First, Shamate dress is often high-profile and direct. When customizing fashion in <em>Revelation M</em>, you can adjust the color temperature and hue to make the entire fashion emit fluorescence, announcing at the first time that “this dress is <em>tuwei</em>“. Second, others can see that the Shamate appearance is intentional by the player, and not really a lack of aesthetics. It can be seen that the two players dressed up in the picture above actually put a lot of effort into it. The male character in fluorescent yellow in the picture above needs to adjust the hue and color temperature of all the color blocks on the whole body to be uniform to achieve a harmonious <em>tuwei</em>; while the player on the far left, who dyed and printed each part of the clothing with reference to the “Northeast China floral袄” (dōng běi dà huā ǎo, a traditional Chinese jacket with a bold floral pattern), carefully chose suitable prints and adjusted their positions.</p>
<p>In contrast, players rarely choose appearances like the one below, where it is difficult to tell whether it is “intentional” or “just their aesthetic”, as a symbol of showing off their personality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F2b050c0a-b621-4865-a110-0381325f55c2.jpg/size/"></p>

<p><em>A fashion in Revelation M that has received negative reviews</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”"><a href="#2-“This-is-My-Wife-He’s-So-Handsome”" class="headerlink" title="2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”"></a>2. “This is My Wife, He’s So Handsome”</h2><p>Games are a virtual world, and players can choose to play a role that is completely different from themselves, even including gender. In MMO games, it is very common for the player’s gender to be inconsistent with the character’s gender. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F340486c3-3b21-474b-a63f-554e06bdc77e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The character’s appearance, the player’s gender, and his custom tag</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Taking male players as an example, a typical dress for the female characters they control is a fair, youthful, and pure image. For example, in the figure below, the two dresses are from characters controlled by players of different genders. It is not difficult to see that the left picture is a character controlled by a male player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F4cb49cd6-f9ee-4594-b25c-9372d76054ef.png/size/"></p>
<p>If you think about it carefully, the way male players meticulously dress up their characters seems to be no different from girls playing with Barbie dolls in terms of expression. This kind of behavior may be considered by some to be detrimental to traditional masculinity. Similarly, looking at female players, choosing a male character means giving up the exquisitely detailed dresses. Given the high opportunity cost and potential risks, why are players still enjoying choosing opposite-sex characters?</p>
<p>Because when the player’s gender is inconsistent with the character’s gender, the character image is no longer equivalent to the player’s social image in the game, but a projection of personal aesthetics. In other words, at this time, “I am no longer me”, and the player and the character have a subject-object relationship.</p>
<p>Taking the “Ni Su” (逆苏 - nì sū) culture, which has often been mentioned in recent years, as an example, Ni Su, that is, “reverse Mary Sue”, originally meant that in the fan circle, fans gave traditional female qualities to their favorite male artists through secondary creation of materials related to them, reconstructing the gender roles of themselves and the artists, and forming a new dominance relationship. For example, calling a male artist their “wife” is a typical “Ni Su”.</p>
<p>In MMORPGs, some female players also have similar behaviors when manipulating male characters. In their gaming habits, the male characters they manipulate are more like the image of the opposite sex they idealize, and they will dress them up according to their own aesthetics. But in game social interaction, no matter whether the character’s appearance is cold or noble, female players often have distinct personal characteristics. They have no intention of playing “a翩翩公子 (piān piān gōng zǐ, a handsome and elegant young man)”, but comfortably reveal their own personalities as social beings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F2810975e-888f-46fd-9f87-216ee0750737.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>A female player’s dress-up of her male character in Justice Online (Source: Weibo Justice Online Super Topic)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In this case, players have fixed expectations for the characters they manipulate, which contain the player’s own aesthetic preferences. The player’s main consideration is no longer the group’s aesthetic standards, but whether they like it and whether it exceeds their expectations.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”"><a href="#3-“Talented-Scholars-and-Beautiful-Ladies-Naturally-White-Clad-Officials”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”"></a>3. “Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies, Naturally White-Clad Officials”</h2><p>In the fashion stores of various MMO games, there is always a white fashion that sells very well. “Fairy”, “elegant” and “noble” seem to be eternal keywords. In the research, we found that when players evaluate the aesthetics of fashion, they pay more attention to the temperament shown behind the fashion. In today’s extreme pursuit of personalization, why do many female players have such similar preferences. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F517131d9-1b7b-4591-a65e-41d6e72481a5.png/size/"></p>
<p>Because in the pursuit of white clothes, players also become more “beautiful” people, to ultimately gain public (social) recognition.</p>
<p>Many MMO themes in China are based on various martial arts&#x2F;xianxia masterpieces. Most MMO players are from the 80s&#x2F;90s generation and have been deeply influenced by martial arts writers such as Gu Long and Jin Yong. They have a similar understanding of the events of the <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, the martial arts world), for example, when it comes to the true, good and beautiful female image in the <em>jianghu</em>, there are the following descriptions:</p>
<p><em>“Her appearance is peerless, both beautiful as a fairy and bright and gorgeous, with skin like ice and bones like jade, as pure as a fairy from Gǔyè, with a natural and spiritual beauty; her martial arts are light and elegant, defeating enemies and winning in a graceful and charming way.” “She is upright and bright, broad-minded, and repays grievances with virtue.”</em></p>
<p>The above is Mr. Jin Yong’s description of Xiaolongnü in the original novel “The Return of the Condor Heroes”. In fact, if you read carefully, you will find that these two descriptions do not mention clothing and appearance, but the association given to people is a female image with white clothes and black hair like a waterfall. When the entire group has been influenced by a certain culture, individual aesthetic preferences may also be assimilated.</p>
<p>From this perspective, we have formed a connection between qualities such as “natural and spiritual beauty” and “bright and gorgeous” and concrete features (“white clothes” and “skirts”), because in too many film and television&#x2F;artistic images we have seen, white-clad swordsmen who uphold justice, that is, elegant women in white clothes, are more likely to be recognized by the public. Therefore, a white dress may also be more attractive in the eyes of others, thereby gaining the recognition of others. Of course, this process is not necessarily conscious, that is, players do not necessarily buy to seek recognition, but as a form of self-expression, gaining recognition is one of the influencing factors of personalization.</p>
<p>Does this phenomenon have scalability and practical significance?</p>
<p>In previous contacts with <em>Revelation M</em> players, we classified daily temperaments and confirmed their preferences through player choices. The actual sales of related fashions and players’ preferences for temperament confirmed and expanded the above conclusions: in addition to “fairy white clothes”, some “non-white clothes” appearance designs with “elegant”, “noble” and “classical” temperaments are also very popular with female players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fbd47b52e-80a7-4539-984a-d2fc5ea896ab.png/size/"></p>
<p>In summary, fashions with elegant colors, flowing skirts, and exquisite and atmospheric fabrics are more likely to be favored by female players; at the same time, they need to outline the slender and beautiful limbs of female characters and show a graceful waist. Many players are disgusted with the bloated look (such as thick skirts and sleeves, fluffy fur collars and shawls).</p>
<h2 id="4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”"><a href="#4-“How-Can-a-Macho-Man-Wear-Pink-”" class="headerlink" title="4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”"></a>4. “How Can a Macho Man Wear Pink?”</h2><p>In male players’ choices of fashion, there are also such group characteristics. Their sensitivity to fashion details is relatively lower, but many male players have a common demand, that is, the characteristics of fashion cannot have a feminine or charming temperament (i.e., cannot be “effeminate”). Even as society becomes more and more tolerant of male aesthetics, this is still a major minefield in the design of game fashion appearances. Why can’t many male players accept clothes with this kind of temperament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2F3b28df6f-712b-4954-9530-2cf1333d8f90.png/size/"></p>
<p>Because while rejecting the “feminine” appearance, male players are also avoiding the possibility of a setback in social status, so as to maintain their dominant position in the group&#x2F;society.</p>
<p>In the traditional gender binary, men and women are given stereotypes in society that are not related to gender itself (“pink is for girls, blue is for boys”). More deeply, the social status of men has been higher than that of women for thousands of years in the past (“three cardinal guides and five constant virtues”). Traditional masculinity has gradually become equated with higher social status in practice. Conversely, having traditional female qualities means “being dominated” and “submissive”. Therefore, for some players, wearing pink fashion is so “disgusting” because it means that traditional male characteristics are dissolved, resulting in the loss of power and status, and they cannot be recognized as men.</p>
<p>In MMO games, when a male player manipulates a male character to wear clothes with traditional female qualities, he is likely to be ridiculed by men and even some women. This is detrimental to the social image, so many male players may consider avoiding such fashions to avoid image frustration.</p>
<p>As a positive example, the “breakout hit” appearance “Jing Hong Yu” (惊鸿羽 - jīng hóng yǔ, meaning “Graceful Feather”) previously launched by <em>Justice Online</em> also confirms this view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20221214%2Fe3d09472-6c23-44fc-8720-f5dcfc1259bf.png/size/"></p>
<p>Launched in 2020, this fashion was a breakthrough in the appearance design of <em>Justice Online</em> - exposing the chest and abdominal muscles of male characters; once launched, this fashion was a double harvest of popularity and sales. In fact, the design of Jing Hong Yu also has the characteristics of large-area exposure and bright colors. But why are its sales so high?</p>
<p>Because the freshness brought by the “design breakthrough” made the overall public opinion at that time tend to be positive, this fashion was considered to be “lined”, “domineering” and “sexy”, and even female players requested to buy it in public opinion. In this scenario, buying Jing Hong Yu does not damage the traditional masculinity, on the contrary, it is another emphasis on the ideal social image of male players. Therefore, male players of <em>Justice Online</em> have passionately placed orders for this fashion that “looks very domineering” and “is liked by young ladies”.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, appearance characteristics that may be considered by players to have traditional female qualities include: bright colors, exposed skin, soft makeup, etc. However, whether it is “effeminate” or not is a very subjective concept, which varies from player group to player group. For example, in the above-mentioned <em>Justice Online</em>, male fashions presented in a V-shape always fail to escape being described as “feminine”. But in <em>Revelation M</em>, players are more tolerant of this type of clothing design. But in any case, as long as the player feedback on a male fashion forms a clear negative public opinion about “wearing it is very effeminate”, the sales of this fashion are likely to decline.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This article starts from the choice of fashion appearance by MMO player groups, and analyzes the situation where the choice of fashion is affected by social factors. After being given social significance, players will consider the social image they present in communication when choosing fashion appearances. For example, in order to pursue a higher evaluation, players often choose fashions with features that are generally recognized in the group, such as elegant and ethereal white clothes; to avoid potential risks, such as a setback in social status, male players will avoid choosing appearances with specific designs that may be considered to have a certain temperament.</p>
<p>User and player research will not be a combination of independent characteristics. As individuals, players’ needs, behaviors and habits affect each other on different levels. Understanding and explaining player behavior from different perspectives can help us build a more comprehensive understanding.</p>

    <title>Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players: Analysis of Several Game Fails</title>
    <url>/2023/01/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20230105_28584_1061653/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230105/28584_1061653.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, <em>nijigen</em> (二次元) users have increasingly become the focus of game developers as a potential audience, and on this basis, a variety of genres and gameplay of <em>nijigen</em> games have emerged. However, not all <em>nijigen</em> games can fully meet the needs and expectations of <em>nijigen</em> players. Numerous cases of games stepping on landmines also tell development teams that, as a highly specific player group, <em>nijigen</em> players have some significant minefields in terms of game experience and evaluation. This article will start from the characteristics of <em>nijigen</em> players and analyze the potential experience minefields that <em>nijigen</em> games may encounter.</p>
<h2 id="1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games"><a href="#1-Why-Do-Nijigen-Players-Play-Nijigen-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?"></a>1. Why Do Nijigen Players Play Nijigen Games?</h2><p>Before answering this question, we must first define what <em>nijigen</em> is. <em>Nijigen</em>, originally meaning “two-dimensional world”, originated in Japan and later became a specialized term in the ACGN subculture circle (including animation, comics, games, novels, etc.), mainly referring to animation, comics, and game works composed of two-dimensional images, as well as the virtual world constructed by their derivatives. In a sense, <em>nijigen</em> is used by the ACGN subculture circle as a term for a fictional world or a fantasy world. It is essentially an existence distinct from the real world (<em>sanjigen</em>, 三次元, meaning “three-dimensional”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1628b45d-7740-4139-a5e3-576f6c85fafa.png/size/"></p>
<p>Considering the broad concept of <em>nijigen</em> itself, the definition of “nijigen games” is also diverse. According to the target players, <em>nijigen</em> games can be divided into two types: “surface <em>nijigen</em>“ and “core <em>nijigen</em>“. Surface <em>nijigen</em> games refer to traditional genre games with a <em>nijigen</em> aesthetic style. The <em>nijigen</em> art style is just a way and means for the game to package traditional gameplay; while core <em>nijigen</em> games are more complex, they explore the deep-seated needs of <em>nijigen</em> culture and users. In terms of game worldview and plot construction, character design, and gameplay ideas, they more reflect the characteristics and preferences of <em>nijigen</em> users as a highly specific subculture group.</p>
<p>In order to understand the reasons why this core <em>nijigen</em> game may attract <em>nijigen</em> players, we used questionnaires and in-depth interviews for research, and summarized the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game factors</strong>, including but not limited to fun game mechanics, good-looking game character design, and attractive plots.</li>
<li><strong>Social factors</strong>, including wanting to integrate into the surrounding circle of friends, socializing with like-minded people, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>tendency of <em>nijigen</em> culture itself to be dreamy and escapist</strong>, including players’ emotional sustenance for game characters, and the game world view can help players escape from real-life pressures and problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players"><a href="#2-Where-are-the-Potential-Minefields-for-Nijigen-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?"></a>2. Where are the Potential Minefields for Nijigen Players?</h2><p>Considering the many needs of <em>nijigen</em> players for <em>nijigen</em> games, in recent years, domestic game developers have continued to make efforts and launched a variety of <em>nijigen</em> games. However, it should be noted that not every <em>nijigen</em> game is fully in line with the needs and expectations of players after its launch. What’s more, some games have stepped on landmines during the launch and continuous operation, which ultimately led to a decline in players’ in-game activity and out-of-game reputation. Why do these games touch minefields? Where are the potential minefields for <em>nijigen</em> players? By analyzing famous <em>nijigen</em> game failure cases on the market, this article draws the following conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations"><a href="#Minefield-1-The-Game-Background-and-Character-Settings-Do-Not-Meet-Players’-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations"></a>Minefield 1: The Game Background and Character Settings Do Not Meet Players’ Expectations</h3><p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding and expectations of the cultural background, worldview, character settings, and their relationship with the characters in the game. Therefore, there may be differences in understanding between game developers and players in terms of the game worldview&#x2F;cultural background, character settings, and the relationship between players and characters, which may lead to deep-seated misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<p>For example, in September 2021, the new SSR Shikigami, <em>Hagishime</em> and <em>Shokurei</em>, announced during the fifth anniversary celebration of <em>Onmyoji</em>, caused a lot of controversy in player gathering and game exchange communities such as Weibo Super Topic and Zhihu. By analyzing the negative public opinion feedback from players, we found that the focus of the controversy was mainly on the art style of the two Shikigami. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9e14f1bd-5a3f-433b-ad1c-a835fa9b39b5.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The art style of the Shikigami is very inconsistent with the game’s art style. Hagishime looks like a traditional Japanese-style Chinese girl, wearing a tight-fitting small cheongsam, which makes me feel sick.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Chinese style elements of the new Shikigami are not well reflected. They are purely Japanese-style Shikigami, but they are mixed with Chinese style elements, which is very abrupt when they stand with other Shikigami. Onmyoji doesn’t look like Onmyoji anymore.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It’s very uncomfortable. The concept is already a Japanese-style game, but now it packages Chinese culture as Japanese characters, speaks Japanese, and can also blow sugar figures, our intangible cultural heritage. It’s hard not to make people think too much.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that the main trigger of this public opinion incident was that the design of the new Shikigami was mixed with Chinese style elements, which was relatively abrupt compared to the original Japanese style of <em>Onmyoji</em>. We know that <em>nijigen</em> culture originated in Japan. Although it has a significant influence in East Asia and even the world, the Japanese-style imprint of <em>nijigen</em> itself is still very distinct. Based on this, <em>nijigen</em> users are very sensitive to the possible Japanese&#x2F;Chinese style mixing in <em>nijigen</em> works, and feel that it is a challenge to the “purity” of the cultural background of the work.</p>
<p>In addition, domestic <em>nijigen</em> players are very sensitive to possible historical hints related to Japan and China in the game. When designing the worldview and characters, it is also necessary to try to avoid domestic players’ negative historical imaginations, including but not limited to wars of aggression, colonial history, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the game’s worldview and cultural background, <em>nijigen</em> players also have a unique understanding of the character design, art style, and their relationship with the characters in the game, which also requires developers to continue to pay attention during the game development and continuous operation. We still take <em>Onmyoji</em> as an example. In 2019, the official designed a new skin for the Shikigami <em>Onikiri</em>, as shown below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F276b255c-26d6-40db-a615-a32a174fc321.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>As soon as the new skin was launched, it was questioned by many players. Players believed that the bangs, the sharp blade designed in the style of a kitchen knife, and the <em>kariginu</em> (狩衣) that resembled an apron made <em>Onikiri</em>, known as the “most powerful demon-slaying weapon of the Minamoto family”, appear “maid-like”, which was very different from its long-standing image of a “sharp blade” in the hearts of players. This case also tells us that in terms of character portraits and skin design, <em>nijigen</em> games should be in line with <em>nijigen</em> players’ imagination of character rarity, personality, and combat strength. Even when setting the skin and skill strength of popular characters, it is necessary to carefully consider player expectations.</p>
<p>The characters and settings in <em>nijigen</em> games are not completely independent of the players’ imagination. On the contrary, <em>nijigen</em> players are considered to be consumers with the characteristics of productive consumers (prosumers). They are often not limited to unilaterally consuming the acquired <em>nijigen</em> content, but also provide new content possibilities through their own understanding and reprocessing. This also requires <em>nijigen</em> games to provide interfaces for players’ active deconstruction and reshaping in terms of worldview, character, and plot design. Generally speaking, this interface is through the direct relationship between the player and the <em>nijigen</em> character, which is generally divided into four relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyber Lover Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with romantic elements. Players believe that they have an ambiguous relationship with the characters. “Playing the game is like falling in love with a paper person”.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivation Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games with strong cultivation elements. Players believe that they are raising the characters, and the characters are their own “children”.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive Relationship:</strong> Players believe that they can immerse themselves in the characters and integrate into the game world through the observation and behavior of the characters.</li>
<li><strong>Spectator Relationship:</strong> Mostly appears in games where the characters have their own storylines. Players are more of spectators and plot promoters, watching the love and hate between the characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nijigen</em> players often have their own understanding of their relationship with the characters in the game. The same character in the same game can even have completely different plot and character network development when interpreted by different players. At this time, <em>nijigen</em> games need to try to avoid large errors between their own design of the plot and character relationships and the players’ own imagination. For example, if a player regards a character in the game as a “waifu”, but a real official NPC partner appears in the process of advancing the plot, this will cause discomfort to the player’s experience.</p>
<h3 id="Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen"><a href="#Minefield-2-Failure-to-Effectively-Handle-the-Relationship-Between-Nijigen-and-Sanjigen" class="headerlink" title="Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen"></a>Minefield 2: Failure to Effectively Handle the Relationship Between Nijigen and Sanjigen</h3><p>The previous minefields are limited to <em>nijigen</em> games and users themselves, but under this minefield, <em>nijigen</em> games need to face the broader impact of <em>sanjigen</em> reality. In the eyes of <em>nijigen</em> players, one of the important demands of experiencing <em>nijigen</em> games is to escape reality. Although <em>nijigen</em> and <em>sanjigen</em> have mutual influence, it is necessary to make a clear distinction when necessary. For example, players are very taboo about <em>nijigen</em> characters having significant <em>sanjigen</em> prototypes or private settings, which they believe affect their own immersion and imagination. In addition, in the selection of spokespersons for <em>nijigen</em> games, <em>nijigen</em> players have their own screening strategies: in addition to being in line with the character settings, they will also consider a certain ranking of spokespersons. Celebrities and idols from <em>sanjigen</em> may even be criticized by <em>nijigen</em> players for their traffic and influence.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that <em>nijigen</em> games and <em>sanjigen</em> are completely unrelated. If there is a problem with the behind-the-scenes staff of <em>sanjigen</em> (including but not limited to legal, political, and moral issues), which affects the player’s experience of <em>nijigen</em> characters, most <em>nijigen</em> players cannot tolerate it, and the official needs to respond quickly.</p>

Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?"></a>3. Summary: How to Analyze the Game Needs of Specific Groups of Players?</h2><p>The analysis of the possible experience minefields of <em>nijigen</em> players in <em>nijigen</em> games shows the importance of analyzing the characteristics, preferences, and minefields of specific player groups for the successful development and continuous operation of games. What kind of ideas and methods can be summarized from this?</p>
<p>In terms of research ideas, it is first necessary to analyze the portrait and needs of specific player groups. The development team needs to understand the characteristics of the player group and analyze the possible needs of players for the game from the characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, questionnaires can cover a larger group of players in a short period of time, which can help the development team to draw relatively “universal” group characteristics. However, if you encounter situations where you need to dig deeper into details, you can use more qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups for research.</p>

    <title>How to Interpret the Emotions of Players from European and American Communities Through Their Online Chats</title>
    <url>/2022/12/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20230105_28584_1061655/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230105/28584_1061655.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Player interactions within the game community are an important channel for us to collect player feedback. Unlike face-to-face communication, when we look at the chat content in the community, we lack information beyond language, such as eyes, gestures, and tone of voice, to help us grasp the player’s emotional tendency. If we only focus on the literal meaning of the chat, we might take the player’s sarcasm seriously.</p>
<p>Take the following messages as examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br><em>Game just entirely froze right as the last team came into view. In a gold 1 rated ranked match….nice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br><em>New patch for bots is lovely there absolutely a joke now thanks naraka</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br><em>Player 1: whens gta6 coming out<br>Player 2: 2045<br>Player 1: damn that early?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nice”, “lovely”, “thanks”, “early” seem to reflect the player’s positive emotions, but if you look closely, you can find something wrong: How can it be a good thing to have a problem (froze) in a gold 1 ranked match? If the bots after the new patch are really lovely, how can they be a joke? Is it really early for <em>GTA6</em> to come out in 2045? It seems that no matter what language the players use, they like to use sarcasm.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to correctly interpret players’ emotions from their expressions, in addition to mastering the language used by players, we also need to understand some of their emotional language expression habits.</p>
<h2 id="1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Emotions-of-European-and-American-Players-from-Word-Transformations" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations"></a>1. Understanding the Emotions of European and American Players from Word Transformations</h2><p>Words are composed of letters, so players will manipulate the letters to transform the words. Common methods include using uppercase letters, repeating letters, and replacing words with letters or numbers that sound similar.</p>
<p>Capital letters are generally used at the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, etc., so capital letters are more powerful than lowercase letters, which are usually used. Players will use capital letters to spell words or sentences to express emphasis and strong feelings. For example, we once saw a comment like this: “WHY IS THERE NO SHOWDOWN FOR HALLOWEEN?!?!?”. The player likes Showdown and really hopes to be able to play this mode during Halloween, so the whole message uses capital letters, and the formal deformation is very eye-catching, so as to express their strong desire to play the Showdown mode.</p>
<p>Repeating letters is related to lengthening the pronunciation. For example, one “i” in “ship” is a short vowel, while “ee” in “sheep” is a long vowel. Players can lengthen the word and pronunciation by using repeated letters in the word, such as Morrnnninnggggg (morning), Leeeeeeeeaaaavvvveee (leave), Chilllllll (chill); it can also be used to emphasize the loudness of the sound. SHEEEEESH in the rooster meme below is an example of this usage. Both the image and the text of the rooster meme indicate the loudness of the sound. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F211974b2-df0f-4dd9-800b-6b4b2e45d248.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Meme containing repeated letters</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Repeated letters can also be used to express emphasis, “I have 2 buckets candieeees”. This is a player participating in the in-game Halloween event, where players can get event items by giving candy bags to other players, but this player has two candy bags that cannot be given away, and naturally, they cannot get event items. Players sometimes encounter fellow singers in chat and suddenly start a lyric chain, you say “PROVOKINNNNNGGGGGG”, and I say “BURY THE LIGHT DEEP WITHINNNNN”, using both capitalization and repetition, making people feel the loudness and energy of the song just by looking at the message. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F2287a125-8ef7-4fe8-b98a-616b26366b29.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players engaged in a lyric chain</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players will also use letters and numbers to replace words or parts of words that have the same pronunciation, such as “b4” for “before” and “U” for “you”; sometimes they will also use the pattern of an item with the same pronunciation to represent a word, such as: “U owe me a skin no [image of a hat]”, the hat pattern at the end of the sentence refers to the word “cap”, and “cap” here means “lie”. This sentence means “you owe me a skin, don’t lie”.</p>
<p>Players bet with skins in the game, and the loser has to give the winner a skin. Since “lie” has a slightly serious accusatory meaning, the player uses “cap” instead of “lie” to make the conversation more relaxed and lively. Using the hat pattern instead of directly typing the word further weakens the negative color of “lie”, making the sentence more euphemistic, like a friend reminding jokingly, “Hey, you owe me a skin, don’t lie”. Players also use spaces and line breaks to change the presentation of words and sentences. For example, adding spaces between each letter of a word, L i e s, gives the feeling of spelling out each letter, highlighting the player’s serious attitude and emphasis; another example is using line breaks to split a sentence into paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p><em>One</em></p>
<p><em>Is</em></p>
<p><em>Gonna</em></p>
<p><em>Grab</em></p>
<p><em>Me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each line break is a pause. This form emphasizes the content of each line, which better reflects the player’s pride and confidence in their gaming skills.</p>
<h2 id="2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere"><a href="#2-Simplify-Writing-to-Create-a-Relaxed-and-Interesting-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere"></a>2. Simplify Writing to Create a Relaxed and Interesting Atmosphere</h2><p>In addition to using memes, European and American players also like to be lazy, using many abbreviations, omissions, or slang in community chats. These methods can not only save typing time and improve chat efficiency, but also help create a relaxed and interesting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a great way to be lazy. We have also encountered abbreviations before, such as ASAP for “as soon as possible”; players will also use the first letter of each word to represent commonly used phrases or sentences, such as “rn” for “right now”, “goat” for “greatest of all time”, “ngl” for “not gonna lie”, “wdym” for “what do you mean”. When we encounter similar abbreviations, we can google the original phrase and accumulate them and create a “player’s common slang library” for future public opinion work.</p>
<p>Omission is also used skillfully by players. Players will omit vowels or consonants in word spelling, and omit punctuation in sentence spelling. In word spelling, vowel letters are omitted, leaving only consonant letters to provide clues to the pronunciation of the word, such as “abt” for “about”, “smh” for “somehow”, “tlk” for “talk”, “nvm” for “never mind”. Although the words are not spelled completely, players who are familiar with this method can restore the complete words through consonant letters.</p>
<p>In addition, players sometimes omit consonant letters, such as “em” for “them”. In order to avoid sensitive words, players will also omit consonant letters, “shi” (omitting the final t). In addition, they will also use symbols with similar shapes to replace letters ($ for S) or use spaces to break up words. As for the omission of punctuation, the first to bear the brunt is ‘, so can’t becomes cant, and I’ll becomes ill.</p>
<p>There is also some slang among players, such as “cap” for “liar”, “simp” for “a person who is overly attentive to someone they like”, “beef” for “brag, show off”. If you can use abbreviations, omissions, and slang skillfully, you must be an active member of community communication and have made great contributions to creating a relaxed and interesting community atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id="3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills"><a href="#3-Mixing-Other-Foreign-Languages-to-Find-Partners-and-Demonstrate-Language-Skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills"></a>3. Mixing Other Foreign Languages to Find Partners and Demonstrate Language Skills</h2><p>Players will also mix other foreign languages besides English when communicating in the community. The use of foreign languages is either to find partners who use the same language, or to enhance feelings in the process of discussing foreign language learning. Mastering multiple languages is also a manifestation of ability. For example, players will also mix in a few sentences of Spanish or French when chatting, with the purpose of finding friends who speak the same language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: Como vas amigo (How are you, friend)<br>Player 2: Bien. Y tu? (I’m fine, and you)<br>Player 1: Esperando encontrar una partida (I want to find a partner to play games)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the vast sea of English, the sudden appearance of a few sentences in Spanish is like an indicator light, guiding two players who use the same language to get to know each other and become good friends who play games together. But not all friend requests sent in foreign languages will be responded to, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 3: alguien habla español ¿? (Does anyone speak Spanish?)<br>mi nick es “ ……” (My game nickname is…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This player sent a friend request in Spanish and attached his game nickname, but failed to meet a partner who also speaks Spanish in the channel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F912e6a5c-260a-4c5f-ad0d-011e9deb36b8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Player looking for a Spanish-speaking partner</em></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F3798b3c7-d56d-4d94-bb60-024690802652.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Failed to find a Spanish-speaking partner</em></p>
<hr>
<p>European and American players also have foreign language courses in school, the most common being Spanish and French. Occasionally, players will ask other players for help with foreign languages in the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: First language is Spanish but have been learning English since 4th grade<br>Player 2: Teach me espanol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that mastering multiple foreign languages is also a manifestation of ability. Players’ community IDs will also use other languages. Some are Korean players such as “서융”, and some are influenced by Chinese games and use Chinese IDs like “卧虎藏龙” (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Fcb335308-e94a-43d4-9285-d3d08e3cbe37.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players Using Korean and Chinese IDs.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of using Chinese IDs, players have repeatedly mentioned the Chinese game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in game-related discussions, and have the impression that Chinese players are good at <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> because of low latency. Therefore, some players inevitably complain that they are afraid of seeing Chinese names, and that a large number of Chinese players use smurf accounts to play on their servers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player 1: chinese named players strike fear into my soul i stopped playing for a while to see if the player based would become more diverse and now i hear xbox has naraka<br>Player 2: Spoiler alert<br>Half of those CN names<br>Are NA players<br>Like me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But another player told him that half of the players with Chinese names in the game are not Chinese players, like he uses a Chinese name. Later, some players explained that using Chinese names is to scare enemies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F9f2e099a-51bb-4469-a01e-f4e5d807dabb.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>North American Players Using Chinese IDs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to Chinese nicknames, a phrase called “raw dragon” frequently appears in player chats. At first glance, it seems inexplicable because it has nothing to do with the context. But if you translate these two words into Chinese separately, “raw” &#x3D; “生”, “dragon” &#x3D; “龙”, and the combination is “生龙”, doesn’t this pronunciation sound familiar? Isn’t this the “升龙” (“Shoryuken”, “Rising Dragon”) in the game? These foreign players really understand the word. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2Ff0bed8dd-552a-4f16-841f-fff477f6b632.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World"><a href="#4-Emojis-Memes-Used-All-Over-the-World" class="headerlink" title="4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World"></a>4. Emojis&#x2F;Memes Used All Over the World</h2><p>Some say that music transcends culture and language, and so do emojis. Emojis use pictures to express emotions, and the meaning of most emojis can be inferred and felt from the picture, without being affected by language.</p>
<p>European and American players like to use emojis in chat. In Discord, emojis are roughly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>● One is Discord’s own basic emojis, which are free for players to use;</p>
<p>● The second is the emojis provided by each server in Discord to players, which can only be used within that server (unless you subscribe to Discord Nitro). The official <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> server provides a set of emojis for players, including emojis based on in-game heroes and emojis newly created based on popular emoji elements (Pepe the Frog, etc.);</p>
<p>● The third is GIFs. Players can search for popular GIFs or save the GIFs they encounter in chats for their own use.</p>
<p>European and American players use these three types of emojis when chatting in the community. Discord’s own emojis and the emojis provided by the current server are the most frequently used by players and are most likely to generate emoji chains, because everyone can use these two types of emojis freely, which is a common language among emojis. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp"><a href="#nbsp" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F32055299-f4d6-423b-a7e4-93b34f6a239e.png/size/"></h2><p><em>Various Emoji usage on Discord.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Players use different emojis according to the chat content, and sometimes use emojis to express simple meanings. The meaning of basic emojis (similar to the emojis that come with Apple products) is not affected by language, such as [heart] to express “love”, [eyes emoji] to express “watching”, “secretly observing”.</p>
<p>Complex emojis can express richer meanings, so players need to observe the pictures and feel their emotions. For example: this emoji is slightly different from the usual dog head, and the meaning is also more friendly, with the meaning of “leisure”, which can be used to watch other players chat, and is also easy to cause emoji chains. However, the most frequently used emoji is Rua. This flustered kitten will not go wrong in any occasion. It has mixed meanings of “surprise”, “excitement”, and “greeting”. It is simply a versatile emoji that is not easy to go wrong in any occasion. But if you delve into the meaning of Rua, the answer can only be “Rua is Rua!”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F1cb4bb7f-1f3b-46f2-902a-f1774aaec16e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Common Emojis.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Emojis can also be used for dialogue. Taking server emojis as an example, players will take out server-limited emojis that previous players have not posted, which is a tacit understanding of the same server; the same situation applies to personally collected GIFs. If a player who prefers <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs encounters another player who also has a large inventory of <em>Dragon Ball</em> GIFs, the two will communicate with each other using emojis, while other players who lack this type of emoji may not be able to join the conversation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230105%2F5138c3d3-df6c-4a49-977f-52169769243e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Emoji Usage in Discord Servers</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the emojis in Discord, players will also use emoji characters, which are slightly different from the common emoticons we see. The emoji characters used by European and American players are relatively traditional, basically vertical, and need to be rotated ninety degrees to be understood, :), :(, B(, :&lt;, :C, D:, D;, xD, :D, and some emoji characters can be repeated in the mouth part, deriving emoji characters such as :)), B(((, xDD. By repeating a certain part of the emoji character, players can express stronger emotions. Players also use horizontal characters, such as -.-, T_T, o.O, but rarely use more vivid emoticons or patterns built with characters.</p>
<p>The GIFs collected by players may be very different, but the emojis provided by Discord and the server are shared resources of players on the same server. When players use these shared emojis, it is easier to get corresponding emoji feedback. In addition, when using classic emojis (such as Pepe the Frog) in personal collections, it is also easier to elicit responses from other players.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>When understanding European and American players’ feedback and needs for games through player communities, in addition to language skills, we also need to understand the language expression habits of European and American players in order to accurately grasp the player’s emotional tendencies and understand the player’s real needs. The set of online communication methods in the player community described in this article, such as emojis, abbreviations, omissions, and unusual word and sentence presentation forms in chat, are like eyes, gestures, and tones of voice in face-to-face communication, which can provide us with a basis for grasping player emotions and try to avoid falling into the trap of players’ sarcasm.</p>

<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-Development-of-SLG-Mobile-Games-in-China" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China"></a>1. Overview of the Development of SLG Mobile Games in China</h2><p>Sid Meier, the father of the <em>Civilization</em> series, once expressed his understanding of games with this sentence: “A game is a series of interesting choices.”</p>
<p>Game developers choose and design game mechanics, while players experience choices within the game mechanics, and ultimately, players choose the game. The broad concept of SLG games can be traced back to <em>Civilization</em> in the 1990s. With the development of the Internet era, players gradually began to desire social elements on the basis of single-player gameplay, and SLG mobile games emerged. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F075804e9-2a84-4efc-8575-6c80364b879e.png/size/"></p>
<p>In 2015, with the huge success of <em>Clash of Kings</em> (COK) in the Chinese mobile game market and worldwide, the relatively niche sub-genre of SLG mobile games entered the vision of the general public and game manufacturers. In the same year, just as large and small game manufacturers in China were preparing their own COK-like mobile games, NetEase released a sandbox strategy mobile game called <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> (<em>率土之滨</em>). This mobile game, based on the historical background of the warlord separatism in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, did not become a follower of COK. Instead, it created a unique gameplay mechanism in the SLG category and developed into the pioneering work of the “Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like” category of games that would contend with COK-like games in the future of domestic SLG mobile games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F95ec6618-7a2e-4394-a29f-7878d2d1f135.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the development and iteration of SLG games in recent years, various COK-like and Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like mobile games have sprung up. The limitation of these games is that they only made micro-innovations in the worldview and some mechanisms, but essentially did not deviate from the underlying framework of COK or Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Currently, most mainstream domestic SLGs are simulation strategy war games, whose main feature is a sandbox map as the core activity space, with high social strategy. Unlike SLG series such as <em>Civilization</em> and <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, the core experience and fun of current SLG mobile games have gradually shifted from the content provided by the game itself, that is, the interaction between players and the game, to the behavior and interaction between players.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the main body of player-game interaction and the carrier of interaction between players, the importance of information interaction on the sandbox map of SLG mobile games is self-evident. This article will conduct a preliminary exploration and analysis of battlefield information interaction in SLG games.</p>

The Underlying Logic of Sand Table Types</h2><p>According to the interaction logic of the sand table, the sand tables of SLG mobile games can be divided into two types: coordinate type and path type. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F09dad672-b988-4117-8138-a1350f0b8b26.png/size/"></p>
<p>The coordinate-type sand table is based on a two-dimensional coordinate system. The map elements on the coordinate-type sand table map are all independent “points”. You only need to input coordinate instructions to go to the target position. The sand table maps of <em>Clash of Kings</em> and <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> belong to the coordinate type. The path-type sand table is similar to a network topology. It adds path requirements on the basis of the coordinate-type sand table. Players need to have “connecting land” to reach the target location. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F54619b7b-8a65-4959-af56-963116ac556c.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Different sand table types bring vastly different depths of gameplay strategy and division of labor. For example, the unique mechanisms of “road paving” and “battle-free period” in Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games come from this. Although the path-type sand table type can provide deeper and broader playability, it also increases the game burden on players to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Although some Romance-of-the-Three-Kingdoms-like games have introduced functions such as AI automatic road paving or scheduled occupation, overly intelligent proxy operations also compress the player’s operating space, resulting in a decline in the game’s DAU. The future trend of SLG mobile games may be to achieve a balance between auxiliary tools and game experience, so that players with different levels of dedication can “get what they want” and maximize the game experience in their respective positions.</p>
<h2 id="3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements"><a href="#3-Interaction-Design-of-Map-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Interaction Design of Map Elements"></a>3. Interaction Design of Map Elements</h2><p>Thanks to the real historical background and reliable element architecture, in the grand sand table map of over 2.25 million tiles, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only has historical cities of the late Eastern Han Dynasty, famous historical sites admired by the world, and natural terrain processed for balance based on strict adherence to real mountains and rivers, and resource lands for player development, but also includes building elements with military or development functions. These rich map elements jointly participate in the construction of the game mechanism of this work, giving it a strong historical atmosphere and a strong sense of immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F26f226c8-9386-4698-aa5d-84a99bd14aaa.png/size/"></p>
<p>In order to enable players to efficiently and stably obtain the information meaning of many map elements and minimize the occurrence of misoperations, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> mainly designs from the following two levels:</p>
<p>In terms of visual interaction, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> designs visual elements consistent with its semantics for each map element, which greatly reduces the cognitive burden of players. For resource lands with two to nine levels, it first uses four typical characteristic elements of mountains, forests, iron smelting, and rice to distinguish them, and then differentiates them according to the number of elements (two to four levels) and buildings (five to nine levels). In addition, in order to meet the visual preferences of different players as much as possible, the game also provides 2D&#x2F;3D visual schemes for players to freely switch.</p>
<p>In terms of map interaction, when the player clicks on any land unit on the map, the detailed information of the unit and corresponding operation prompts will be displayed. For operations that cannot be performed, grayscale images are displayed instead of being directly hidden. Moreover, when the player clicks on the interaction option, the reason why the operation cannot be performed will be informed in text, so that the player can understand. Through detailed interaction feedback, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> not only greatly reduces the learning threshold and cognitive burden of new players, but also effectively avoids many misoperation events caused by inadequate information interaction, which greatly improves the player’s interaction experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F14e64f92-2868-4a94-a2f6-098b55687f38.png/size/"></p>
<p>Similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>, the resource lands of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> also use characteristic elements and buildings to graphically distinguish resource lands, and further directly and clearly mark the level of resource lands in the form of text. This visual interaction design achieves a win-win situation in terms of experience and efficiency. However, <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> is limited by the overall map style and is not suitable for direct map marking, so it can only be supplemented by interaction feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, the map resource search control of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> can quickly locate the target type and level of resource land, freeing players from the tedious map information retrieval, which greatly improves the player’s interaction efficiency and game experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F9e238179-e48f-4464-a2e0-f4fbd309c8e2.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers"><a href="#4-Exploring-the-Connotation-of-Marching-Markers" class="headerlink" title="4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers"></a>4. Exploring the Connotation of Marching Markers</h2><p>“Marching” in <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> refers to the command operation of sending a team from a certain starting point to a certain end point. When the player issues this operation, a marking line composed of directional arrows will be formed between the starting point grid and the end point grid, so that the player can obtain marching information. At the same time, there will be an army element walking along the marching marker line. This element consists of a marching icon, a marching countdown, and the troop composition: the enemy and friend can be identified by the icon and the color of the marching marker (blue for allies, red for others), the marching countdown shows the time remaining until the end of the march; the troop composition represents the arms that make up this troop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F37ad7f0f-7a00-4c6d-9ceb-da9777c80fdd.png/size/"></p>
<p>In actual combat, the information value provided by marching markers is far more than what is shown on the surface: by identifying enemies and friends, you can judge the approximate scale of the enemy and our forces invested in the current land&#x2F;war zone; by analyzing the troop composition of the army element, you can analyze the arms attributes and characteristics of the three generals that make up this troop, and guess the configuration of the incoming troop based on the mainstream troops of the version; according to the marching countdown and the preview of the marching time, you can grasp the timing of the troop’s attack. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F114839bf-f81f-4482-be77-e4500f516ff2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The marching marker elements of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> are similar to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players on the same sandbox map can obtain information such as enemy and friend information, marching countdown, and troop composition through marching markers. But unlike traditional SLG mobile games, the RTS control mode of <em>Rise of Kingdoms</em> adds more possibilities to marching. Although RTS has higher requirements for the player’s online time, and micro-operations are difficult to truly realize on the mobile game platform, this flexible mode with a stronger operating experience has attracted a large number of players and received good market feedback.</p>
<h2 id="5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map"><a href="#5-Design-Iteration-of-the-Strategic-Map" class="headerlink" title="5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map"></a>5. Design Iteration of the Strategic Map</h2><p>As the core element of the SLG mobile game mechanism, the alliance (nation) mechanism is not only a centralized social window in the game, but also the main platform for players to obtain settlement rewards in the season process. The confrontation between players takes the form of wars between alliances. In the vast sandbox map, it is crucial to distinguish enemy and friend information intuitively and efficiently. <em>Clash of Kings</em> uses different land grid colors to distinguish the ownership of different alliances, while <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> has innovated the land ownership information in multiple dimensions: the player’s own land units are marked in green, alliance units are marked in blue, non-alliance units are marked in red, hostile alliance units are marked in dark red, and friendly alliance units are marked with a blue border… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F30605791-57b5-4dfd-96eb-9e3dfed99faf.png/size/"></p>
<p>“Six Secret Teachings” says: “Ascend to high places and look down to observe the changes of the enemy.” If you can see the overall situation, you can plan to defeat the enemy; if you are blinded by a leaf, you will inevitably be trapped. On the battlefield, if you can quickly grasp the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, you can make more accurate strategic judgments. The core of the SLG requirement path is a strategic model based on multi-person participation in phased requirements (exploration, expansion, development, elimination, etc.). With the continuous development and improvement of the SLG mobile game alliance mechanism, and the refinement of the division of labor of players’ roles and positions in the alliance, the early lower-level map information mode based on land unit information can no longer meet the information needs of local tactical strategies and even global strategic posture formulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fa511d00f-8ab0-46ef-8866-1efc8af9a4c4.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Limited by the screen size of mobile games, players can often only obtain more information by constantly sliding the screen. This method is not only inefficient but also easily confuses information, which seriously affects the game experience of some users. Although the “larger field of view” configuration option provided by early developers in the game settings already has the prototype and awareness of a strategic map, this does not fundamentally solve the problem. In the strategic map level, most of the map elements have become generalized summary information. At this time, land unit information is no longer important. These information unrelated to decision-making will be filtered out, leaving more global map information for decision-makers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4fc1e88d-75df-410d-8977-694eaa3fb3c5.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the August 2022 update, the strategic map function was officially launched in all season servers of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em>. Players can enter the strategic mode by zooming out the screen view. In the strategic mode, the visual range is 20 times that of the normal view, providing players with a more macroscopic observation perspective, so as to easily grasp the overall situation and provide strong support for the strategic decision-making of alliance commanders.</p>
<p>Different from the detailed land information in the normal view, the strategic view abstracts and simplifies various information elements, focusing on key strategic information such as land ownership, marching routes, garrison status in war zones, native cities and facilities, and extreme weather effects. Although the strategic map of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Strategy</em> was launched later than similar competitive products, this strategic map that deeply fits the gameplay of Romance of the Three Kingdoms effectively reduces the burden of information recognition for players, highlights the important information that players really need in strategic analysis, and greatly optimizes the map information interaction experience while improving interaction efficiency. </p>

<h2 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h2><p>As the main body of player-game interaction and the key carrier of interaction between players, the SLG game sand table battlefield not only carries the logical framework of the entire game, ensures the harmony and unity of the screen style and theme setting, but also takes into account the player’s interaction experience and provides corresponding support controls. It can be said to be the most basic and most worthy of repeated consideration in SLG games.</p>
<p>This article mainly focuses on the information interaction of the sand table battlefield, and briefly discusses the underlying logic of its sand table type, the interaction design of map elements, the connotation mining of marching markers, and the design iteration of the strategic map from the perspective of user experience. So far, the problems to be solved and the contradictions to be coordinated in the SLG sand table map still exist. It is believed that with the development and progress of the industry, better competing products or updates will bring a better game experience to players.</p>

    <title>Breaking the Fourth Wall - Meta Elements in Narrative-Driven Games</title>
    <url>/2023/01/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20230202_28584_1071368/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230202/28584_1071368.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The fourth wall is a virtual wall facing the audience in a traditional proscenium stage with three sides, symbolizing the boundary between the audience and the actors, reality and virtuality.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional stages such as movies and dramas, narrative-driven games are stages with more interaction; when the boundary between the game and reality becomes blurred, the player’s cognition of the game will be challenged. Imagine that you are controlling the protagonist to do “silly things” in the map for fun, but he suddenly turns his head and stares at you, and asks you to stop… This kind of design that breaks the fourth wall belongs to meta.</p>
<p>Meta-games, also translated as “metagames” or “hypergames,” and out-of-game elements beyond the gameplay itself can be called meta elements. Narrowly speaking, a meta-game refers to a full-process game that takes breaking the fourth wall as its core gameplay; in general narrative-driven games, meta elements of different depths can also be added to produce a momentary stunning effect.</p>
<p>In traditional game design theory, emphasis is placed on creating a virtual world isolated from real life as much as possible through various rules and restrictions, as well as graphics, music, dialogue, etc., to maintain the player’s immersion. Game design based on meta elements does the opposite, blurring the boundaries between games and real life by breaking the illusion of the game, thus bringing strong emotional experiences to players: ordinary games pull you into the screen, while meta-games always try to crawl out of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#1-The-Use-of-Different-Types-and-Depths-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements"></a>1. The Use of Different Types and Depths of Meta Elements</h2><p>Meta means breaking the concept of traditional games at some level, such as the player being the only conscious operator in the game, the game content and out-of-game computer operations not interfering with each other, the virtual world of the game not containing concepts such as players, artists, and developers. Meta elements can generally be divided into language, trick, and interactive experience; the shallower depth can only be used as a decoration to adjust the atmosphere, and the deeper excavation can become the core of the game’s plot or even the core of gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature"><a href="#Meta-Design-with-Easter-Egg-Nature" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature"></a>Meta Design with Easter Egg Nature</h3><p>As embellishments, meta elements often appear in the form of surprises or easter eggs, and do not have a strong challenge to the player’s cognition. In fact, the appearance of game producers who were originally hidden behind the scenes in the game and interacting with players is a very common meta design; they often make statements that are extremely inconsistent with the style of the game or give special items, allowing players to temporarily break away from the serious game plot and take a breather; some more detailed meta designs can also surprise players, such as waiting for a period of time on the start interface, and the small animal facing away from the screen suddenly turns to look at the outside of the screen, etc. </p>

<h3 id="Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot"><a href="#Meta-Design-About-Character-Plot" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design About Character Plot"></a>Meta Design About Character Plot</h3><p>One type of meta that explores deeper and is widely used is to imply or explicitly state that the characters in the game have self-awareness that is not controlled by the player; the characters know that they are game characters, and can understand the existence of the player, and even read the player’s user folder name to address the player.</p>
<p>The experience of being recognized is a double-edged sword. When the character’s attitude towards recognizing the player is peaceful and friendly, and there is no very intense interaction, the player will feel that this is a novel and interesting experience, such as Anna in <em>VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em> who knows that she is in a game and tries to escape. However, when the game character shows criticism, sarcasm, or hurt towards the player, this experience of being watched will bring a great psychological gap to the player and re-examine their game behavior. </p>

<h3 id="Meta-Design-that-Challenges-the-Concept-of-Games"><a href="#Meta-Design-that-Challenges-the-Concept-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="Meta Design that Challenges the Concept of Games"></a>Meta Design that Challenges the Concept of Games</h3><p>Common sense about games includes: the passage of time in the game world is independent of the passage of time in the outside world, and the game can be exited and restarted at any time; the game is an independent software, the game process is independent of the player’s operation of the system, and will not affect the external system. One type of meta element breaks through this common sense of the game and replaces it with the common sense of the real world.</p>
<p>In the RPG horror puzzle game <em>The Witch’s House</em>, the player can enter a hidden ending where the character in the castle dies on their own due to being left unattended for a long time by waiting at the birth point for an hour without entering the castle; in the game <em>Needy Streamer Overload</em>, to achieve the hidden ending where the heroine quits the internet, the player needs to play the game offline. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fcfc8d149-e1cb-4ea8-94af-8d87ceaa3920.jpg/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Atypical-Meta-Design"><a href="#Atypical-Meta-Design" class="headerlink" title="Atypical Meta Design"></a>Atypical Meta Design</h3><p>There is also a type of meta that is not meta in the usual sense, which creates a better sense of immersion by breaking the boundary that one thought oneself was in a single-player game. For example, in the boss battle of a certain ending of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, players can get assistance from other players who have cleared the game; after winning the battle, players can choose to sacrifice their entire game save in exchange for help for subsequent players, just like previous players. </p>

Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?"></a>2. Psychological Effects of Meta Elements: Is This a Game?</h2><p>In traditional narrative-driven games, when players control the characters on the screen, they identify themselves with the identity of the protagonist on the screen on the one hand, and clearly know their identity as players on the other hand. Being a player means that one is the only conscious character in the game, and the behavior in the game will not affect real life, and there is no need to bear any responsibility and material loss for the behavior - these unspoken common principles in the game ensure that players can safely immerse themselves in the game experience.</p>
<p>The excellent meta with greater depth can bring players unexpected, surprising, fearful, fooled, and even ashamed emotional experiences, often stemming from its challenge to the traditional relationship of “real-world player - virtual-world game”.</p>
<h3 id="Becoming-the-Watched-God"><a href="#Becoming-the-Watched-God" class="headerlink" title="Becoming the Watched God"></a>Becoming the Watched God</h3><p>Meta-games often challenge this common sense: the content and characters in the game are the objects of the player’s cognition, and will not in turn recognize the player. In traditional narrative-driven games, players are often the only conscious operators in the game, and interacting with the game is essentially a kind of self-entertainment.</p>
<p>However, when the object in the game behaves like an independent conscious individual and can recognize the player, the player will enter a social situation from a state of solitude, falling from an omnipotent god to a height where he needs to make eye contact with the character; his behavior suddenly has an audience watching, becoming an experience of being caught off guard.</p>
<p>Being watched means being exposed. When people don’t want to expose themselves and feel that they are about to be exposed, they are prone to fear and anxiety. This is also why meta elements most often appear in games containing psychological horror elements. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Ff708c528-80f3-4809-9932-92b3038f0e80.jpg/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Loss-of-the-Mask"><a href="#Loss-of-the-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Loss of the Mask"></a>Loss of the Mask</h3><p>The fact that the player is not recognized means that his identity in the game is actually indistinguishable from other players, that is, he has anonymity. In a completely anonymous psychological state, the psychological pressure on individuals from group norms or the influence of others will be reduced, which has the effect of relaxing the mood and reducing stress, but it is also accompanied by the loss of social responsibility and the danger of inducing various horrors and venting behaviors.</p>
<p>The game provides players with a sense of anonymity, that is, it provides players with the opportunity to play comfortably and freely in the virtual world, and even try various behaviors that cannot be tried in the social environment without regard to the consequences.</p>
<p>But when the character or the game itself is linked to the player’s real life in some way and monitors the player’s actions, arousing the player’s self-awareness, the player’s anonymity is suddenly violated, and he becomes an active participant in the plot from a casual player who does not need to be responsible, and needs to be responsible for everything that happens to the character. </p>

<h3 id="Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone"><a href="#Out-of-Control-Experience-in-the-Safe-Zone" class="headerlink" title="Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone"></a>Out-of-Control Experience in the Safe Zone</h3><p>A sense of control refers to a psychological state in which the direction of things is under one’s control; it can enhance an individual’s positive emotional experience such as optimism and self-confidence, and weaken negative emotional experiences such as depression and helplessness. In real life, people have to face all kinds of loss of control caused by force majeure; therefore, the important charm of traditional narrative-driven games is to try to interact with the corresponding worldview system, and the player’s power to decide the fate of virtual characters.</p>
<p>Meta elements do the opposite, subtly depriving players of their sense of control in the virtual world. When players unexpectedly find that they cannot fully control their choices, cannot anticipate the relationship between their behavior and reactions, or the reactions caused are completely beyond expectations, a sense of loss of control arises. Just like a roller coaster, the temporary eruption of negative emotions is also a benign stimulus under the condition of no real danger; the anxiety caused by loss of control on the one hand pulls the player back to reality to think, and on the other hand can become an excitement point for some players. </p>

<h2 id="3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements"><a href="#3-Design-Ideas-of-Meta-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements"></a>3. Design Ideas of Meta Elements</h2><p>The most mainstream meta design forms in current narrative-driven games include interface crashes, intervention in reality, narrator intervention, and multiple playthroughs. Interface crashes guide players to pay attention to the attributes of the game itself as software, such as the start button of <em>Pony Island</em> is designed as <code>&lt;error&gt;</code> at the beginning, and players must repair it; intervention in reality takes it a step further on the level of “the program itself has life”, such as <em>IMSCARED</em> will create a new strange folder on the player’s computer desktop and put the puzzle clues in it, and players will also operate pixel computers in the game; narrator intervention is to use an independent narrator to interfere with the player’s choices, and the domestic horizontal fighting game <em>ICEY</em> is a typical example in recent years; multiple playthroughs are widely used in many pixel RPGs and Galgames, and are often related to save-related operations. The famous meta game <em>OneShot</em> has made very clever use of this technique.&lt;&#x2F;error. </p>

<p>In essence, many meta elements are designed for the player’s own meta-gaming behavior. The environment gives players some prior knowledge, such as when a warrior in a game environment sees a monster named Medusa for the first time, the player knows to instruct the warrior to take out a mirror to reflect the gaze. In ordinary games, players will unconsciously use many meta-gaming strategies, that is, resort to out-of-game elements in their minds to make decisions in the game, such as directly entering the password in the second playthrough of a puzzle game based on memory. Ordinary games have no feedback on this strategy, and recognizing the player’s own meta-gaming behavior and setting feedback for the behavior is a way to break the fourth wall.</p>
<p>For example, in the well-known beautiful girl (horror) game <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em>, players are often deceived by the energetic color scheme and cute character images, and substitute traditional cognitions about other games of this type in their minds: not all characters can be captured, and they may also die tragically, and game saves may disappear at any time. </p>

What Can Meta Bring Us?</h2><p>The existence of meta techniques actually expands the upper limit of the ideas that plot-driven games can express as a game medium. When the boundary between virtual and real becomes blurred, the content conveyed in the game is related to real life, and what is finally left to the player is inexplicable melancholy and subtle reflection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fbf1ee034-cc48-42e5-b98f-bd6013c1898e.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In <em>The Stanley Parable</em>, players can only get a variety of endings if they refuse to always follow the narrator’s instructions.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps not all meta designs are good designs; many times, they also appear only as a pastime in the tense game process. However, the potential of meta elements to convey philosophical thoughts is also undeniable. Although serious meta blurs the boundary between virtual and real, its necessary step is to awaken players from the omniscient and omnipotent dream in the game. In this sense, breaking the fourth wall is actually not breaking the wall, but discovering this wall spiritually; in the face of a living game, we have to start examining our own game behavior, our relationship with the game, and perhaps our own lives.</p>

    <title>Mastering the World Seeing the Big Picture in Game Mini-maps</title>
    <url>/2023/01/20/netease-ux-articles/news_20230202_28584_1071374/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230202/28584_1071374.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game maps are simulations of real environments, with cognitive, simulation, loading, and transmission functions. Their design is to guide players to choose certain paths and trigger certain events in the game. The mini-map in the game displays a part of the area centered on the character, which can help players quickly identify the surrounding environment, terrain, and target information. It is often placed in the corner of the game screen and is a map form that helps players determine their position in the game world.</p>
<p>So, as a game designer, how should you make good use of this information display area to convey key information to players and present a “seeing the big picture” design effect? This article will introduce three aspects: concise and clear information expression, association with character status, and association with player needs.</p>
<h2 id="1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression"><a href="#1-Concise-and-Clear-Information-Expression" class="headerlink" title="1. Concise and Clear Information Expression"></a>1. Concise and Clear Information Expression</h2><p>The mini-map function is indispensable for some games and players, but at the same time, its existence will reduce the player’s immersion in the game and distract the player’s attention to the game screen. The simplified information expression design of the mini-map is not only to pursue higher information retrieval efficiency, but also to reduce its visual interference through design, thereby enhancing the sense of substitution for the character to explore the world.</p>
<h3 id="Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display"><a href="#Low-Saturation-Map-Display-High-Saturation-Marker-Display" class="headerlink" title="Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display"></a>Low-Saturation Map Display, High-Saturation Marker Display</h3><p>Appropriate contrast can make the foreground map elements and icon labels easier to distinguish visually from their backgrounds. Different from the simple background color in general interface design, the map uses the default base map, and the content display is more complicated, which makes the mini-map need to be more refined in the use of color. In the game mini-map design, the following points can be summarized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-saturation map base map, markers use high-saturation theme colors to be consistent with the game’s visual style</li>
<li>Clear color levels, colors of different hues should be both contrasting and coordinated</li>
<li>Effective use of the symbolism of colors (such as the warning of red and yellow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Use-Icon-Details-to-Represent-the-Z-axis"><a href="#Use-Icon-Details-to-Represent-the-Z-axis" class="headerlink" title="Use Icon Details to Represent the Z-axis"></a>Use Icon Details to Represent the Z-axis</h3><p>As a two-dimensional plane, the mini-map can be used to confirm the player’s own xy-axis position, but additional instructions are needed on the z-axis, so making the target icon have multiple states is a common indication method. Some games use whether there is a height difference as the state distinction. For example, in <em>Battlefield 1</em>, when the character has a height difference with the target object, the marker will change from solid to hollow, which is used to roughly estimate the enemy’s position. The z-axis representation of some games includes three states: up, down, and horizontal. Use the direction of the arrow to confirm your z-axis position. For example, in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, use small arrows next to the target to show above or below. </p>

<h3 id="Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information"><a href="#Integrated-Display-with-Other-Information" class="headerlink" title="Integrated Display with Other Information"></a>Integrated Display with Other Information</h3><p>The game’s HUD is an integrated display of a “symbol list”, which needs to summarize and link similar information to form a clearer HUD layout. As a component of the HUD that occupies a large proportion, the mini-map will attract more attention from players. Displaying some information close to the mini-map allows players to always observe other information every time they check the mini-map to confirm location information, and at the same time allows the player’s visual route to be more stable and concentrated. Common examples include system information such as weather, temperature, and time. Some games also integrate character status information such as health and energy into the mini-map, but it is also necessary to pay attention to how to display this information when the mini-map UI is closed.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, special location sensing, temperature, sound, time and weather information are displayed with the mini-map in the lower right corner of the interface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F47dcfb1d-f335-41d0-b88d-2b43cb6f6496.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, health and energy and other information are combined with the mini-map in the form of small icons, and integrated information is displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fe97d898d-2e26-4866-b0ec-0cb50be6f112.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em>, health and focus are integrated with the mini-map in the form of edge strips. Integrated information display makes the entire HUD design clearer and simpler. But if the mini-map is closed, all important indicators on the UI will disappear with it, which is a point to pay attention to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd690d1b6-2663-4556-bf4d-5f35e526b774.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Edge-Blurring-Effect"><a href="#Edge-Blurring-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Edge Blurring Effect"></a>Edge Blurring Effect</h3><p>Compared with the frame design with harder outlines, the edge blurring effect can make the mini-map better integrate with the game environment and reduce visual interference. At this time, the base map is mostly a wireframe effect after grayscale processing, and the logo object is more prominent. <em>Dying Light</em> and <em>Diablo III</em> both adopt this method. Compared with <em>Darksiders II</em> with a stroked border, the visual center of the picture is significantly different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F95aae912-782d-4594-b9b9-f77e2c1026d4.png/size"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F3893b3d4-9317-43d6-b827-ec878bf54c33.png/size/"></p>

The form of the compass will not excessively destroy the sense of immersion. Their position is usually placed in the center of the top, and the design is not too conspicuous. Although it indicates the direction of the destination, it still cannot show the exact path that the player needs to take, which requires the player to still rely on their own exploration to reach the destination. Compass-style guidance makes pathfinding a part of the game loop and retains its core function. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fd423018b-0224-4369-98d9-436d12248eb9.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-Associated-with-Character-Status"><a href="#2-Associated-with-Character-Status" class="headerlink" title="2. Associated with Character Status"></a>2. Associated with Character Status</h2><p>Since the character’s status in the game is constantly changing, for example, when moving and sprinting, the player’s needs for vision will be different. When the character is attacked, the mini-map, as a HUD element, can also give feedback prompts to the player through design. Therefore, the display of the mini-map also needs to be associated with the character’s status, taking into account different usage scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting"><a href="#Weaken-the-Map-Display-in-the-Moving-State-and-Expand-the-Map-Field-of-View-Display-When-Sprinting" class="headerlink" title="Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting"></a>Weaken the Map Display in the Moving State, and Expand the Map Field of View Display When Sprinting</h3><p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, when the character is in a sprinting state, usually in the situation of looting spoils, chasing enemies, and accelerating escape, the player’s need is to obtain a farther field of view. Therefore, the mini-map in the lower left corner will shrink and present a farther range of content. When sprinting ends, the display range returns to the original normal size. In <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, when the character moves, the task mini-map will automatically become translucent, which is convenient for players to observe the game scene while finding their way, without excessively blocking the player’s sight. </p>

Feedback performance is usually in the form of mini-map border color and mini-map special effects. Among them, the change of border color is more obvious, and high-saturation colors are mostly used to distinguish. The mini-map special effects are mostly to simulate the real state of being attacked, such as screen failure flickering, heartbeat scaling, etc., so that the mini-map is no longer a single UI independent of the game.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, the mini-map has a black border in the normal state. When a battle is about to occur or a large monster appears around, a larger black border will appear around the mini-map and keep zooming like a heart rate, simulating the effect of accelerated heartbeat; after entering the combat state, the map border turns red; if the character is hiding in the grass or wearing an invisible suit at this time, the border will turn purple to indicate that the monster has not found the character in the field of vision, but is still on alert; after leaving the battle, a thick white border appears around the mini-map and then returns to the normal state, indicating that the danger is over; when riding a monster, a large white border appears around the mini-map to show the monster’s stamina value. The lower the stamina value, the smaller the diameter of the white border, until the stamina value is exhausted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F82302794-65e6-4033-8139-d0d0ffffafe3.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Need for Speed Heat</em>, when the player has a car crash, the mini-map will shake like a data stream to simulate the situation of the dashboard failure after a car crash in real life, giving the player feedback prompts while creating a real immersive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2F4e218385-ad05-4a7b-8f40-3e42ab9f86d1.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Associated-with-Player-Needs"><a href="#3-Associated-with-Player-Needs" class="headerlink" title="3. Associated with Player Needs"></a>3. Associated with Player Needs</h2><p>For different types of games and players’ different growth states, even different difficult terrains, the functional requirements of the mini-map vary from person to person, from time to time, and from shape to shape. Design needs to consider the player’s needs at all times, giving the mini-map more custom options and adaptation schemes to ensure a smooth and immersive game experience for players.</p>
<h3 id="Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner"><a href="#Mini-maps-Also-Need-to-Be-Hidden-in-a-Timely-Manner" class="headerlink" title="Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner"></a>Mini-maps Also Need to Be Hidden in a Timely Manner</h3><p>Due to the high information density of the mini-map and the prominent visual effects of some game mini-maps, it will cause the player’s visual center to shift and lack immersion. Many games allow players to close the mini-map UI to optimize the immersive experience. By guiding in the game scene, such as NPC pathfinding&#x2F;road signs&#x2F;scene interaction&#x2F;area prompts when changing locations + player memory and other forms to achieve the purpose of pathfinding. At the same time, for example, in scenes where fighting is the core operation, direction information becomes unnecessary information, and simplifying the UI to provide players with a more focused interface design is also particularly important.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the mini-map can be switched freely. When the mini-map is closed, pressing the D-pad will briefly display the mini-map to help players quickly identify the direction.</li>
<li>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, when the player is fighting fiercely with the boss, because the player’s core need at this time is to fight and focus on the battle, the compass-style mini-map guidance will disappear at this time, and the absence of redundant UI also increases the epic sense of the battle.</li>
<li>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, players are provided with normal mode and expert mode. The expert mode hides the mini-map, allowing players familiar with the operation to focus more on immersing themselves in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain"><a href="#Provide-Special-3D-Views-in-Complex-Terrain" class="headerlink" title="Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain"></a>Provide Special 3D Views in Complex Terrain</h3><p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, due to the variability and complexity of the interior of the Divine Beast, at this time, players need not only the information of the xy axis, but also the information of the z axis. Therefore, after entering the Divine Beast, the mini-map will switch from a 2D俯视 (fǔ shì - top-down) view to a 3D three-dimensional view to help players obtain information for exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230202%2Fce639c44-baa0-4063-81cc-1d6aa95454a5.gif/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The increasingly rich mini-map design forms are indeed eye-catching. Creative and rich detail expression simplifies the game’s pathfinding experience and improves the efficiency of map information retrieval. However, the setting of the mini-map will make many players dependent. Compared with focusing on exploring the in-game scene, the “God’s perspective” mini-map makes information acquisition easier, which will make players lazy and mechanical in exploring the world. Therefore, the mini-map not only needs a concise and immersive UI design, situational interaction design, and multi-state mode design, but also needs to give players appropriate space to process information independently. Providing personalized guidance experience for different players and scenes may also be a good solution.</p>

    <title>How to Create and Adapt Overseas Questionnaires for Global Game Releases</title>
    <url>/2023/02/09/netease-ux-articles/news_20230215_28584_1073274/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230215/28584_1073274.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a game released globally, understanding the needs of overseas users is crucial, whether during the development or operational phase. Especially when we need to stand from a more macro perspective, understanding the target market users’ product cognition, behavioral characteristics, gaming habits, and content preferences, the traditional research method of questionnaire surveys becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Questionnaire surveys can achieve understanding of all the above information in a relatively short period of time. And launching questionnaires in the game is a very effective method in the process of game development and user research, with characteristics such as “relatively low cost, relatively short time, and relatively fast conclusions.” In this article, we will tell you how to conduct the most efficient questionnaire surveys and provide some tips to avoid pitfalls when doing player research in overseas markets.</p>
<h2 id="1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games"><a href="#1-Multi-language-Classification-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Multi-language Classification in Games"></a>1. Multi-language Classification in Games</h2><p>Multi-language classification is always essential in globally released games. However, we face a choice: which languages should we use? Let’s first look at the number of speakers of each language in the world. Besides Chinese, English (1 billion), Spanish (570 million), Hindi (540 million), Arabic (420 million), Malay (280 million), French (270 million), Bengali (270 million), Russian (270 million), and Portuguese (250 million) are the most spoken languages. Moving to games, let’s look at two examples, the enduring <em>GTA5</em> and the recent masterpiece <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, both of which are AAA-level masterpieces from world-renowned manufacturers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F71487fa7-4701-495d-86e4-d254fec9b182.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2Fa7bc2442-2b27-4a84-ad57-4a5b0c466433.png/size/"></p>
<p>As you can see, in these two games, the very populous languages Hindi (540 million), Malay (280 million), and Bengali (270 million) are invariably ignored. In addition, <em>GTA5</em> does not have Arabic. Instead, both games have German (180 million), Japanese (130 million), Italian (100 million), Korean (80 million), and Polish (50 million). The total number of speakers of these five languages is roughly equal to the number of Hindi speakers. Therefore, the choice of languages to adopt in the game is obviously not simply based on the number of speakers.</p>
<p>So, is it because of the purchasing power of players? Not necessarily. Among the 18 countries in the Arabic-speaking region, the combined GDP of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and Qatar alone is about the same as that of Italy. Among them, Saudi Arabia’s per capita GDP has reached 24,000 US dollars, and its consumption power is not much different from that of developed countries, not to mention Qatar, a country with a per capita GDP of more than 60,000 US dollars. Despite this, Arabic still does not appear in <em>GTA5</em>‘s language list. However, the potential player consumption power of this country also allows us to see the demand for Arabic from <em>GTA5</em> players in the Middle East on forums. Therefore, the language chosen by the game is not necessarily completely related to the purchasing power of players or specific regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F8690d5eb-ce73-4814-bbcb-e8668ac488c6.png/size/"></p>
<p>Faced with the demands of so many languages, the in-game language and the language of the in-game questionnaire must have made corresponding trade-offs and balances.</p>
<h2 id="2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires"><a href="#2-Multi-language-in-Questionnaires" class="headerlink" title="2. Multi-language in Questionnaires"></a>2. Multi-language in Questionnaires</h2><p>So, how do you determine which languages to localize for overseas questionnaires? Let’s first look at the example of Arabic. Why haven’t many successful domestic games launched overseas done Arabic localization?</p>
<p>From the environment outside the game, although the video game industry and game culture in Arab countries are developing rapidly and there are many national support policies, they are still in the initial stage and have not been fully rolled out.  At the same time, although the Gulf countries are rich, the gap between the rich and the poor is very serious, and some countries are still in long-term war. Finally, many cultures or doctrines in Arab countries also conflict with game content or worldviews. Many manufacturers find it difficult to customize game content specifically for the Arab region in order to pursue efficiency and security.</p>
<p>From inside the game, students who have seen Arabic and have done game localization must know that Arabic localization is a thankless task: because of the different writing habits (from right to left) and different lengths of words and sentences, the UI design has to be almost redone for localization. The questionnaire system is no exception. Everything is read from right to left, and even the text will be “broken”. In addition, there are many religious and cultural nuances to be considered. Thus, the processing cost is huge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F28166350-8ddc-46c1-a5cb-38eeee8a755a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Breaking it down further into the design of overseas questionnaires, the core is still the same: the cost issue.</p>
<p>For a game like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which has already been launched and is operating, it currently supports 13 languages. When launching a questionnaire overseas for research, is it necessary to design corresponding 13 languages?</p>
<p>The answer is no. Ideally, it would be best if each language and its corresponding country or region had its own easily accessible questionnaire, but this would cause us to lose a great deal of timeliness: when considering horizontal comparisons between Chinese and foreign players, the questionnaire needs to be translated from Chinese to English after the needs are disassembled&#x2F;confirmed and the questions are designed, and then English is used as a bridge language to translate into various minor languages for distribution. Such a schedule often takes at least 1-2 weeks. After the questionnaire results are collected and the data is processed, it is necessary to compare and analyze 13 questionnaires in different languages, which is very cumbersome and error-prone, and may require the intervention of suppliers at this time. In this way, a questionnaire takes nearly a month to obtain valid data and conclusions, and players and the development team have long forgotten what they wanted to verify or investigate before, which will inevitably bring great timeliness problems.</p>
<p>In addition, considering that the number of players in different regions may vary greatly, when the number of samples collected for a certain minor language is limited, we must also consider the reliability and validity of the entire questionnaire when processing data. Feedback from a small number of player groups is very likely to provide biased conclusions or insights in a questionnaire that requires a large sample size, which is an important issue to consider in market and user research.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make some trade-offs. The first thing to consider is the number of online players in the game. To give an extreme example, if we have to choose between Japanese and Korean, and there are 1,000 players using Japanese and only 50 players using Korean, then we will undoubtedly give up including Korean in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>So, you might ask, what about Korean players? At this time, an English questionnaire can be used as a permanent alternative. Even if there are fewer English players, this universal language is always the “last home” for global players, and the same is true for overseas questionnaires. In the design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s overseas questionnaires, we will, considering the schedule of the localization team, add 2-3 minor languages on the basis of Chinese and English, combined with the number of online players, translation costs, and regional characteristics, as the final questionnaire launch.</p>
<h2 id="3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries"><a href="#3-Differences-in-Question-Settings-between-China-and-Foreign-Countries" class="headerlink" title="3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries"></a>3. Differences in Question Settings between China and Foreign Countries</h2><p>After arranging the multi-language questionnaire, let’s talk about the specific design of the questionnaire survey. The core point to pay attention to in this link is: Chinese players have their own unique game culture atmosphere, and other countries also have their own beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, when designing demographic questions, in addition to male and female genders in English questions, we also referred to the Inclusive Forms on gender proposed by UBC’s Equity &amp; Inclusion Office, adding gender options such as “non-binary” to the questions, and in fact, some players did choose this. On the other hand, in the Japanese and Korean language questionnaires, after consulting with localizers in those countries, if options other than male and female are added to the questions, players may feel a little strange, so we still only retain the traditional three options of “male&#x2F;female&#x2F;prefer not to disclose”, which also reflects the difference in values between East Asia and Europe and America. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F19652e40-1121-4403-b22a-de8c04ac5fba.png/size/"></p>
<p>This difference can also be reflected in the specific options of in-game questionnaires. If the option in a certain question is “good-looking hosts and commentators”, this is a relatively common situation in China. Because whether it is the high-end CCTV Spring Festival Gala host or the live broadcast anchors who are closer to life, these people are often good-looking and have good temperament, and the audience will not have any objections. However, when the same option appears in a European or American questionnaire, players may raise some objections. After all, in current European and American games, such as the protagonist of the console game <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the female characters in <em>Apex Legends</em>, they are already more diversified and no longer follow the sexy route like Lara Croft before. This gradual “different paths leading to different destinations” in aesthetics and differences in habits between the East and the West will also affect the setting of questions and options in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>In addition to similar value differences, the unique attributes of domestic questionnaires also need to be noted. For example, the “H5 page” option in domestic questionnaires is not well understood by overseas players. If it is literally translated as “H5” or “H5 page”, foreign players will be confused. At this time, we must consider whether to replace the option, or directly delete the option (when it is judged that it is less used in the region), or put it in the “other” option for players to fill in by themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0f89ec1b-b6d9-4a49-ab62-24659d723151.png/size/"></p>
<p>Of course, some of the most basic things, such as replacing domestic social platforms and media with overseas counterparts, will not be repeated here, but one thing to consider is: it is not just a matter of replacing them with a fixed set of content, but each language questionnaire should be localized according to the usage characteristics of that country. For example, “Allah” cannot appear in Arabic, this word cannot have the Christian cross; in German localization, “SS tier” needs to be considered more carefully when expressing equipment quality because “SS” is the abbreviation of Nazi “Schutzstaffel”, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is some preliminary discussion on the design and launch of overseas questionnaires. To sum up, a very important point is the word “trade-off”. Doing overseas research is of course important, but how to conduct questionnaire research efficiently during the research process is also something we need to consider. We can make corresponding optimal decisions according to the actual situation of our own games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Have you ever been fully immersed in a game, forgetting hunger and time?</em></p>
<p><em>Have you ever felt a sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction after finishing a game?</em></p>
<p><em>If so, congratulations. In this play session, you successfully entered a state of flow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F20cd7349-187a-4895-ae36-4ca9b3330a4c.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Nothing can stop Civilization VI players from the flow of “one more turn”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various psychological principles and phenomena, such as “flow”, have long been closely linked to the video game industry and have rich applications in it. In this article, we will combine specific game cases to explain how the “flow” phenomenon and the positive psychology theory behind it are introduced by game designers to support the game player experience.</p>
<p>First, let’s understand what positive psychology is.</p>
<h2 id="1-About-Positive-Psychology"><a href="#1-About-Positive-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="1. About Positive Psychology"></a>1. About Positive Psychology</h2><p>The core of positive psychology research is what makes life valuable and meaningful. As a discipline, it examines assumptions about what can improve our lives. Its research paradigm is no different from traditional psychology, only the focus of research is different: the traditional psychology field studies “what problems have occurred in human psychology” and tries to find ways to make them less painful; but the goal of positive psychology is to make ordinary life more fulfilling. It focuses on people’s strengths and explores what makes life happier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F1e395bbc-febe-4495-bc39-2e974a211650.png/size/"></p>
<p>Positive psychology is an important supplement to traditional psychology, focusing on the well-being of all mankind. Through its practice, we can be more actively involved in life and find the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>The core question of positive psychology research is how to make people happy, and this is the common fulcrum with video games. In the process of playing video games, players actively exert their rich and diverse strengths and skills to overcome difficulties; they empathize with the characters in the game, thus creating emotional connections; video games will also give them corresponding feedback, so that they can get a wonderful sense of happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what factors affect happiness and apply them to industry practices.</p>
<p>So what factors affect people’s happiness? In 2011, the father of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, proposed the very famous PERMA model in his book to explain the factors that affect happiness, and at the same time better define and explain “what is happiness”.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples"><a href="#2-How-to-View-the-PERMA-Model-with-Game-Examples" class="headerlink" title="2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples"></a>2. How to View the PERMA Model with Game Examples</h2><p>Professor Seligman, the “father of positive psychology”, believes that happiness consists of five elements: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F0d4203fe-cd70-4b96-b147-ce0746fce43b.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Positive-Emotion"><a href="#Positive-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="Positive Emotion"></a>Positive Emotion</h3><p>Studies have pointed out that positive emotions greatly affect the way we view the world. When the level of positive emotions is high, the level of creativity, courage, and optimism will increase: this means that players have stronger control performance in the game. At the same time, under the influence of positive emotions, players have higher cognition and evaluation of the game, and gain more satisfaction and happiness in the game.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to highlight the elements that can make people feel happy in the game and use them to mobilize the player’s positive emotions. For example, the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series produces a refreshing feeling for players during the race through the detailed depiction of the natural scenery of the United Kingdom and Mexico; the recent White Snake Legend co-branded fashion of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> stimulates players’ sense of national cultural pride and ownership while providing players with a beautiful visual experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F2922a14c-eb11-416f-b75b-6cf844864948.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2Faedc67cf-080e-463f-8e93-cda8b53d4149.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Engagement"><a href="#Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Engagement"></a>Engagement</h3><p>What makes you immersed in the game and even forget the time?</p>
<p>It is the “flow” mentioned earlier, proposed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, another founder of positive psychology. In positive psychology and PERMA theory, “flow” describes a state of immersion in the present and full engagement. When players are engaged, their energy and concentration increase at the same time. However, the state of flow is not something that can be entered casually. The game needs to meet the following three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game itself should be rewarding, and players tend to play the game. This is the big premise.</li>
<li>The challenges in the game should take into account the player’s ability. The challenges match the ability, which makes the player more engaged.</li>
<li>Players should feel that they have control over the game during the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F7da88dd9-07ff-4936-b2e8-984548ea61d2.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> and the <em>Civilization</em> series, which have always been regarded as industry benchmarks in the flow experience, also do well in these three points:</p>
<p><em>Sekiro</em> provides players with a hearty gaming experience of cutting into flesh, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with a gaming experience of development and growth, and overall planning;</p>
<p>The difficulty of <em>Sekiro</em> is just on the upper side of the challenge-ability line of most players, and <em>Civilization</em> provides players with up to 8 custom difficulties;</p>
<p>In <em>Sekiro</em>, players play the role of the ninja “Wolf” and constantly improve their combos and reactions during the game. In <em>Civilization</em>, players play the role of the supreme leader of a civilization and constantly optimize the best development strategy during the game.</p>
<p>Although <em>Sekiro</em> and <em>Civilization</em> belong to the action category and strategy category respectively, both have achieved the ultimate in their own fields, creating an immersive game experience for players. </p>

<h3 id="Relationship"><a href="#Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Relationship"></a>Relationship</h3><p>The revolutionary mentor Marx said: “Man is the sum of social relations.” Human beings are social animals and always have the need to maintain connections with others, hoping to have spiritual communication with others. At the same time, good interpersonal relationships often bring people a broader vision, stronger external support and a more stable psychological state.</p>
<p>The selection of game materials is rich and diverse, and naturally it will not lack the description of various social relations in various themes. Whether it is the deep emotional bond established between players and NPCs in single-player games, or the cooperative or competitive relationship established between players in online multiplayer games, it provides unique emotional experiences for players who love this type of game.</p>
<p>In the open-world single-player game <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> with a Western magical background, players will embark on the adventure of the Dragonborn. Among them, Lydia, the first companion encountered in Whiterun, is the partner of most players from beginning to end, accompanying the player to enter dark caves, sweep bandit strongholds, block knives and arrows for the player, share the burden of luggage for the player, share the ups and downs with the player, and accompany the player to travel all over the land of Skyrim. Because of this, Lydia has become almost one of the most talked about characters in <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> and is deeply loved by players. In community-organized polls, Lydia firmly holds the title of “Most Popular Marriage Partner in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim”, which shows the deep emotional connection players have with her. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F503cd314-cc2d-4886-9426-f042c3cfdb62.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Battlefield 1</em>, which focuses on large maps and large battlefields, each battle is based on the historical battles of World War I. Players are divided into camps of 32 people, representing a participating country in World War I to fight for the country. At the beginning of the game, the monologue of the soldiers from that camp will be played to unify the players’ identification with the camp. In the game, players from the same country will mainly generate social links by helping each other, cross-covering, and coordinating charges. The gunfire and the bugle will firmly unite the players’ belief in “fighting for the country”. The grandeur of the charge, the bond between comrades-in-arms, and the belief in the country are all condensed in the short 20-minute game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F6884749b-98a0-49bd-8b55-7d45db135332.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Meaning-and-Purpose"><a href="#Meaning-and-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Meaning and Purpose"></a>Meaning and Purpose</h3><p>When a player has a clear goal, the goal will stimulate the player’s state. When the player has a clear sense of meaning and purpose, he will actively start thinking about how to do better, thus entering the positive cycle of “player input-game feedback-player thinking-player re-input”.</p>
<p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, the winner of the 2021 TGA Game of the Year, two players will play the role of Cody and May, a couple whose relationship is on the verge of breaking down. After another family quarrel, they are turned into dolls that their daughter cannot see by the daughter’s “Book of Love”. On the surface level, the player’s goal is to control the characters through the tasks set by the “Book of Love”, and finally return to their bodies and see their daughter; on the deeper level, the player’s goal is to let the two characters re-recognize and familiarize themselves with each other in the process of passing the levels, find the reason for loving each other, and thus save this family on the verge of breaking up. The pursuit of superficial meaning leads them on a journey of personal growth, thereby finding deeper meaning. The player’s play process is therefore tinged with a sense of mission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F155b4d55-78a1-4d35-bc6a-b339990c2fcb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Accomplishment"><a href="#Accomplishment" class="headerlink" title="Accomplishment"></a>Accomplishment</h3><p>Positive psychology believes that a sense of accomplishment can better improve a person’s resilience and optimism, and make people more courageous in the face of setbacks. Similarly, in the game, appropriately giving feedback to players on small achievements and big achievements can enhance players’ acceptance of challenges and resilience, increase their sense of gain and satisfaction during the game, and at the same time strengthen their motivation to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>The horizontal profile survival game <em>This War of Mine</em> won more than 100 international awards with its cold style, rigorous excavation of history and profound humanistic thinking. It starts from the perspective of small people in the war, takes the real event of the Siege of Sarajevo as the background, and makes players feel the pain, helplessness, and powerlessness of people in the war through a piece of microscopic cruel reality. This also makes the game have strong negative feedback on the player experience. Through the settlement of the small achievements of the player’s daily acquisition of materials and the settlement of the great achievements after the final clearance, the player can get hope for the next day’s survival and the motivation to explore the second week, reducing the risk of players giving up when facing negative emergencies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230215%2F68e28011-39f1-4963-b3a2-5e45fc3e3fc9.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Sid Meier, the master of the game industry, said at the 2010 GDC Game Developers Conference: “Games are a psychological experience”, which profoundly reveals the inseparable link between video games and psychology. The video game industry has developed to this day, and it has to be admitted that its greatest charm for game players is that it creates a rich, complex, immersive, and empathetic psychological experience for players. Although the psychological factors of the game process are not as dazzling as the game’s picture quality and action effects, its existence is the spiritual core of the interactive art of games.</p>

    <title>How to Create the Soul of FPS with Interaction - Gun Feel</title>
    <url>/2023/02/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20230220_28584_1074115/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230220/28584_1074115.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>FPS (First-Person Shooter), as a globally popular game genre, is deeply loved by players for its realistic battlefield atmosphere and exciting competitive confrontation. Every player has their own preferences, and when we evaluate an FPS game, gun feel is always an unavoidable aspect.</p>
<p>So what is gun feel? As a comprehensive feeling, it is difficult to define. It is an objective existence. How many game developers have racked their brains for it: all the feedback during the use of the gun can be included in the gun feel. It is also a subjective feeling in people’s minds: the player’s preconceived cognitive expectation of the gun’s “rules”. Only when the two match and cooperate with each other can a good gun feel be created.</p>
<p>For example, general FPS players perceive the AK as having a larger spread and strong recoil. If the shooting feedback fails to express this level of information, the player will feel that the gun is “weak”. It is difficult to change the player’s cognitive expectations. It is necessary to cater to the player by designing good gun use feedback, and this is the essence of improving gun feel.</p>
<p>All feedback is part of gun feel, but many players will first pay attention to some obvious information, such as gun model accuracy, shooting animation, sound effects, special effects, etc., but they know little about the role of interaction design in it. But it is certain that good interaction design can increase the realism and feel of the gun, and it also needs to be valued and carefully considered.</p>
<h2 id="1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake"><a href="#1-Recoil-System-and-Screen-Shake" class="headerlink" title="1. Recoil System and Screen Shake"></a>1. Recoil System and Screen Shake</h2><p>When it comes to gun feel, many people will give priority to the recoil system of the gun. After all, this is the visual information that best reflects the power of the gun. But what are the manifestations of the recoil system?</p>
<h3 id="Viewkick"><a href="#Viewkick" class="headerlink" title="Viewkick"></a>Viewkick</h3><p>This is the most familiar part for FPS players. It refers to the camera that is constantly raised with continuous shooting, which is普遍存在 (pǔ biàn cún zài - universally present) in all shooting games. The generally-called “recoil control” is to control the recoil of this part. This is a form of recoil expression that almost all FPS games have. In terms of design, it is generally adjusted according to the recoil value of the gun, whether it is scoped, whether it is holding breath, the gun holding action, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F3be7f91f-957d-48b8-a513-d1bb906744b3.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Gunkick"><a href="#Gunkick" class="headerlink" title="Gunkick"></a>Gunkick</h3><p>Gunkick refers to the phenomenon that the crosshair continuously deviates from the center of the camera during continuous shooting, and the exit point of the bullet is tied to the crosshair, causing the impact point of the bullet to change accordingly. Its core lies in the constantly changing trajectory driven by the muzzle shake, which makes the entire shooting process very accurate and real, and can bring an extremely excellent shooting experience, but its implementation cost is also the highest. </p>

<h3 id="Visual-Recoil"><a href="#Visual-Recoil" class="headerlink" title="Visual Recoil"></a>Visual Recoil</h3><p>Visual recoil is similar to Gunkick, but different. It also refers to the crosshair deviating from the center of the camera, but it will return to the center of the screen before the next bullet is fired. It has no effect on the impact point of the bullet (which is always the center of the screen). It is just a visual expression. Simply put, Visual recoil is an animated version of muzzle jump and does not change the trajectory (and the fact is that Visual recoil is indeed a random play of multiple animations). It is enough for shooting games that pursue impact but not extreme accuracy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F3713ef6b-48bb-472b-b236-8177a21e69da.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Viewroll"><a href="#Viewroll" class="headerlink" title="Viewroll"></a>Viewroll</h3><p>Viewroll refers to the phenomenon of rotating around the center of the camera during shooting. It has no effect on the position of the crosshair and the camera, so it is just a visual effect to enhance recoil. Many FPS games in recent years have adopted it. From a design point of view, Viewkick reflects the vertical stability of the gun holder, then Viewroll reflects the horizontal stability. Therefore, the design ideas of these two are not much different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Fcf678b8c-8185-4b86-b13a-9dff283cc083.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Spread"><a href="#Spread" class="headerlink" title="Spread"></a>Spread</h3><p>Spread refers to the phenomenon that bullets are randomly distributed on the diffusion circle with the aiming baseline A as the center. That is, aiming at one point, the bullet will not necessarily hit that point, but there will be an unavoidable deviation. It is achieved by directly modifying the code to displace the bullet by a small distance at a long distance. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the recoil performance system, but in design, it can be used as a supplement to Visual recoil to undertake the task of randomly distributing the trajectory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F88dc50e5-291c-475d-8543-637a8d4ac200.gif/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>Viewkick and Gunkick are the performance of recoil on the aiming baseline, which actually affects the player’s aiming; Spread is to directly modify the position of the bullet to achieve the “offset” feeling in the recoil system; Visual recoil and Viewroll are just visual expressions and have no factual impact on the player’s aiming and shooting (but may still form visual misleading).</p>
<p>Perhaps after talking about the above points, many readers are still confused about the interactive performance of the recoil system. Next, we will use game comparisons to illustrate how the recoil system affects the gun feel from the player’s interactive experience.</p>
<p>First, a horizontal comparison between <em>Battlefield 1</em> and <em>Battlefield V</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F60395801-84d4-435d-b444-a63dade1d9aa.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Comparing the above two animated pictures, which gun do you think has a stronger sense of power?</p>
<p>Many readers will choose <em>Battlefield 1</em> on the right. The reason is that as works of the Battlefield series, the bullet exit points of both are tied to the center of the screen, but because <em>Battlefield 1</em> has Visual recoil, which <em>Battlefield V</em> does not have, its crosshair can move additionally away from the center of the screen, and it has a stronger sense of power in the performance layer of recoil. At the same time, <em>Battlefield 1</em> also has a larger Spread, which enhances the thrill of strafing.</p>
<p>The above two points give <em>Battlefield 1</em> a better shooting experience, but also produced a problem that has been criticized by players, that is, the crosshair of <em>Battlefield 1</em> is deceptive. Aiming but not hitting is the main source of frustration in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. Therefore, DICE studio canceled these two points in the development of <em>Battlefield V</em> in exchange for a “point and shoot” PVP kill experience, and at the same time adopted a larger Viewkick to make up for the shortcomings in the shooting experience.</p>
<p>The above comparison tells us that performance (gun feel) and operation (shooting accuracy) are difficult to balance, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> series (hereinafter referred to as COD) gives a better solution to this problem, that is, Gunkick. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Ff0c07ea2-76f9-4c71-bd9a-efd3364be5c7.gif/size/"></p>
<p>First of all, COD also has the offset between the crosshair and the center of the screen, but unlike the Visual recoil of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the bullet exit point of COD is tied to the crosshair, that is, Gunkick. This offset will not mislead the player’s aiming, because the player’s reference point when making fine-tuning aiming is always the crosshair. In addition, Gunkick can also replace the random effect of Spread’s trajectory, and there will be no problem of erratic trajectory like Spread, which can be described as the best of both worlds. Of course, the disadvantage of Gunkick is that it is difficult to balance cost and performance. Only FPS game industry ceilings like COD can better control it.</p>
<h2 id="2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design"><a href="#2-Crosshair-and-Sight-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Crosshair and Sight Design"></a>2. Crosshair and Sight Design</h2><p>I believe that players of any FPS game will find a strange phenomenon, that is, when we watch games or live broadcasts, we always find that some players or anchors set the crosshair to some strange shapes. After logging in to the game, I also tried the same, but found that other people’s settings were not as good as my own, and the default crosshair felt better. What is going on? In fact, the design of the crosshair and the sight also includes the careful consideration of the interaction designer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F7deaa0d6-5fea-4f3d-8416-1d73c22e5da2.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental"><a href="#Convenience-of-Aiming-is-Fundamental" class="headerlink" title="Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental"></a>Convenience of Aiming is Fundamental</h3><p>The form of the UI is closely related to its function. To answer this question, we must first return to the original design purpose and function of the crosshair - to assist players in aiming at the enemy. A simple sentence can actually be divided into two steps: First, find the position of your own crosshair and the enemy, and move the crosshair to the enemy; second, fine-tune the crosshair to aim at a certain part of the enemy (such as the head) and shoot. Although many FPS veterans are already proficient in shooting and are not aware of the process, they still cannot do without these two steps.</p>
<p>From this, it can be found that the crosshair that contains the larger area is easier to achieve the first step; and the smaller and more precise the crosshair, the easier it is to achieve the second step. This is also the reason why some professional players like to shrink the crosshair: for them, the first step no longer needs any guidance, what they need is to aim at the enemy’s weakness more accurately. In fact, the default crosshair of <em>CS: GO</em> takes into account the above two steps: the small point in the middle is used for precise aiming; the cross around it is used to expand the overall area for rough aiming. Therefore, most players do not need to adjust the default crosshair, and the interaction designer has already considered it thoroughly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F73ada4c3-75fb-4245-b6a8-4503bb3d11cb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Form-Follows-Function"><a href="#Form-Follows-Function" class="headerlink" title="Form Follows Function"></a>Form Follows Function</h3><p>In recent years, with the development of FPS game design and technology, some strange crosshair styles have appeared in the player’s field of vision, but in the final analysis, it is still form follows function.</p>
<p>The crosshair has been around for the longest time. It contains a horizontal headshot line and is widely used in weapons that require precise shooting and pre-aiming; the circular crosshair is suitable for suppression. It clearly indicates the scattering range and is used in melee combat, with AOE damage, and guns that do not require precision; there are also crosshairs with parabolic scales, which are obviously used in some weapons with obvious bullet drop, such as bows and arrows, grenade launchers, etc. These crosshair styles are the most authentic feedback of the weapon, and some even borrowed from the sight of the weapon in reality. They deeply affect the first impression of a gun and also affect the player’s feeling of gun feel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F525528be-d8f2-4090-9f4e-970095378dd1.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Hit-Feedback"><a href="#3-Hit-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="3. Hit Feedback"></a>3. Hit Feedback</h2><p>As the last step of the player’s interaction with the gun, the existence of hit feedback is a great positive incentive. The enemy’s hit action, particle effects, sound effects and other multi-sensory forms of expression constitute the current mainstream FPS hit feedback.</p>
<p>But due to the limitations of many competitive games, for example, in fast-paced games like <em>Overwatch</em>, it is impossible to show the enemy’s hit animation separately for the player, and the hit special effects are also greatly reduced; in <em>CS: GO</em>, in order to ensure the fairness of the competition, animation and special effects are also simplified as much as possible. At this time, interaction designers need to take action to provide certain hit feedback on the UI.</p>
<h3 id="Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross"><a href="#Simple-but-Not-Simplistic-“x”-Cross" class="headerlink" title="Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross"></a>Simple but Not Simplistic “x” Cross</h3><p>In the hit feedback on the UI, most of them are currently attached to the crosshair: when hitting the enemy, an “x” cross will appear on the crosshair, and different variants will present different information. These variants are the focus of the design.</p>
<p>The COD series uses a set of cognitive habits that players have formed for design: when your shot hits the enemy, a white “x” cross appears around the crosshair; if this hit is a kill, the “x” cross appears red; when you attack continuously, the animation of the “x” cross is flashing. Most games on the market currently use this set of UI hit feedback design. Although it is traditional, it is stable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F94824c4a-1953-4847-b829-c02881a7c1bd.gif/size/"></p>
<p><em>Overwatch</em> has made certain innovations: the white “x” cross still indicates a hit, and the red “x” cross is changed to a hit on a weak point, so it is necessary to design another icon to indicate a kill. Overwatch chose the most intuitive red skull. At the same time, Overwatch has also improved the animation performance of the “x” cross under continuous attack, from monotonous “flashing” to increasing the side length of the “x” cross to express the accumulation of damage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F4b9bf058-8d3f-403c-87f0-828c378ae454.gif/size/"></p>
<p>What’s more, such as <em>Biomutant</em>, the hit feedback is directly mounted on the enemy instead of the UI, which makes the hit feedback out of the scope of the UI interface, but more like a stylized special effect. But compared with the former with a fixed position, mounting the hit feedback on the enemy can better reflect the flexibility of the battle and has a better performance in PVE.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Gun feel, as the soul of FPS, is something that every game company must carefully consider and design when making this type of game. A good shooting feel can greatly enhance the coherence and interactivity of the game process and lay the foundation for a good player experience. This is a complex and arduous project. Although interaction only accounts for a small proportion of it, its role should not be underestimated. Whether it is recoil performance, crosshair, or hit feedback, it is what players pay attention to and value. It is believed that with the development of FPS games, more interaction designers will invest in these fields of work and propose more solutions for better gun feel.</p>

    <title>I came, I saw, I conquered Localization Strategies to Help Arabic Games Go Global</title>
    <url>/2023/02/17/netease-ux-articles/news_20230220_28584_1074117/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230220/28584_1074117.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>McDonald’s has opened chain restaurants in more than 100 countries, which is globalization. McDonald’s restaurants in Israel are closed on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. McDonald’s in Dubai uses Arabic to transliterate McDonald’s and designs different menus to cater to Muslims who do not eat pork. This is localization.</p>
<p>As more and more products go global, researchers have created the acronym GILT (Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and Translation) to refer to the activities that companies engage in when they go abroad to do business. Among these words, “translation” is the easiest to understand. Anthony Burgess once said: “Translation is not a matter of words only: it is a matter of making intelligible a whole culture.”</p>
<p>Arabic, as the fifth most spoken language in the world, includes more than 30 different dialects. Millennials, as the main Internet audience, have a growing demand for Arabic video games, leading to more and more game localization services focusing on Arabic. However, Arabic is also considered one of the most difficult languages to localize. Its richness, diversity, and complexity make the localization of games challenging. Compared with major languages such as English, there is a extreme lack of linguistic technology adapted to Arabic. Although all Arab countries speak the same language and believe in roughly the same religion, in fact, the complex multicultural structure makes these countries very different.</p>
<h2 id="1-Adapt-to-the-Technical-Characteristics-of-the-Target-Language-to-Avoid-Potential-Technical-Problems-in-the-Localized-Version"><a href="#1-Adapt-to-the-Technical-Characteristics-of-the-Target-Language-to-Avoid-Potential-Technical-Problems-in-the-Localized-Version" class="headerlink" title="1. Adapt to the Technical Characteristics of the Target Language to Avoid Potential Technical Problems in the Localized Version"></a>1. Adapt to the Technical Characteristics of the Target Language to Avoid Potential Technical Problems in the Localized Version</h2><h3 id="BiDi-Bi-directional-The-Complexity-of-Text-Sorting"><a href="#BiDi-Bi-directional-The-Complexity-of-Text-Sorting" class="headerlink" title="BiDi (Bi-directional): The Complexity of Text Sorting"></a>BiDi (Bi-directional): The Complexity of Text Sorting</h3><p>Perhaps the most well-known textual feature of Arabic is that it is arranged from right to left. In the Pixar film <em>Inside Out</em>, there is a scene where the characters in the film point to a sign and read the text on it. This part of the animation content has been modified for different versions. In the Arabic version of the movie, the characters read the sign from right to left, while in the English version, the reading order is from left to right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2Fe37c3b3b-d180-42a4-8d86-83e888cfa203.png/size/"></p>
<p>In most cases, Arabic is written and read from right to left. However, in some contexts, certain parts of a sentence are written and read from left to right. For example, when numbers and Latin text appear in a sentence, which is common in video games. This makes Arabic a bi-directional (BiDi) language, and Arabic text in any localization software should also reflect this feature. Some video games do not support BiDi, which brings difficulties to the corresponding Arabic version experience. This complexity becomes even more serious when numbers, Latin words, and certain symbols appear in a line or sentence.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the BiDi text display error that appeared in the Xbox One version of <em>PUBG</em>. When a player dies, a message pops up saying “M416 [weapon] killed you with a headshot by J*****8 [player name]”, which does not make sense in Arabic. So in fact, the internationalization stage of the GILT process includes preparing the source code of the game in advance to facilitate and support localization. It can be understood as eliminating or modifying problematic elements of the game upstream, including technical or cultural issues. The Arabic version of the game needs to support BiDi to adapt to the Arabic RTL text direction. The error that appears here is a typical example of the game code preparation or design not supporting Arabic translation&#x2F;localization tasks. </p>

<h3 id="Letter-Connection-and-Right-to-Left-Layout"><a href="#Letter-Connection-and-Right-to-Left-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Letter Connection and Right-to-Left Layout"></a>Letter Connection and Right-to-Left Layout</h3><p>Arabic writing is connected. This writing style requires code or engine support in the game. Such a system will ensure that the Arabic script in the game is displayed correctly, with all letters connected and read from right to left. Some localized games from well-known developers such as Konami do not support Arabic cursive, which makes it difficult for Arabic players to read certain menu items.</p>
<p>In <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em>, developed by Konami, some menu items do not support Arabic cursive. As shown in the figure below, “العب الان” (Play Now), which is displayed correctly, is disconnected because these letters are disconnected and displayed from left to right. However, other menu items are displayed correctly. This script problem was fixed after release, which cost Konami more money, effort, and time. </p>

Customize Localized UI Design and Terminology Unification from User Habits and Cultural Characteristics</h2><p>In addition to the obvious problems of right-to-left and letter connection, carefully scrutinizing every use experience from the user’s habits is a kind of silent localization service.</p>
<h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>The lack of subtitle specifications is not only a problem for Arabic video game localization, but also for other languages. However, the nature of Arabic makes this lack of standardization more serious.</p>
<p>Arabic does not include capital letters to indicate proper names, but occasionally uses punctuation marks to compensate. In order to distinguish between proper nouns and other words, Arabic translators usually choose parentheses or inverted commas. Many video games have adopted this practice. For example, proper nouns in <em>The Witcher 3</em> are enclosed in parentheses; in <em>FIFA 2018</em>, proper names are retained in the source language, which is especially problematic for players who do not speak or read foreign languages; in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, line breaks and color-coding of proper names are used to distinguish NPC names. </p>

<p>Some localization experts believe that using punctuation marks in sentences to distinguish proper nouns from other words is awkward. However, it is difficult for players to read transliterated proper nouns and distinguish them from other words, because some transliterated words look like Arabic verbs or adjectives. Using punctuation marks to uniformly distinguish proper nouns can often improve the readability of audiovisual text and reduce confusion. In fact, it is common to use quotation marks and&#x2F;or parentheses to enclose proper nouns in local TV programs or movies with Arabic subtitles. The same practice and its advantages also apply to in-game text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F70a56080-5fac-424e-a0de-1dd19a77e106.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Transliteration"><a href="#Transliteration" class="headerlink" title="Transliteration"></a>Transliteration</h3><p>Another key issue in Arabic video game localization is the translation and transliteration of proper nouns (names of people or places). This problem stems from the fact that people have different ways of translating English proper nouns into Arabic. For example, in some cases, translators will replace the letters of the source word with the same letters in Arabic. In other cases, the translator replaces the pronunciation of the source word with the pronunciation in Arabic, or provides a translation of the proper noun. Due to the lack of standardized methods for translating proper nouns into Arabic, proper nouns appear less frequently in different types of translation materials, including video games, movies, TV shows, and literary works. For example, Skellige, a city in <em>The Witcher 3</em>, is transliterated in three different ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F076ef0b0-5d45-4014-93e2-dc0bc7de1190.png/size/"></p>
<p>When players face three different transliterations at the same time on the screen: one for his&#x2F;her location in the game world map; one for the list, at a specific task location; and one for the voice-over subtitles, at the bottom of the screen. However, in translation and localization projects, there is no standardized method for translating foreign names. In some localization processes, the Arabic transliteration of proper nouns needs to be managed during terminology development, which helps ensure that specific transliterations are used consistently throughout the project.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Game-Terminology-and-Acronyms"><a href="#Video-Game-Terminology-and-Acronyms" class="headerlink" title="Video Game Terminology and Acronyms"></a>Video Game Terminology and Acronyms</h3><p>When translating games into Arabic, video game developers also need to consider two other elements: the length of Arabic equivalent terms, especially video game menu terms, and the absence of acronyms in Arabic. Therefore, compared with English, translating interface items into Arabic requires more space.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the “Home” button in the English and Arabic versions of <em>Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions</em>. “الصفحة الرئيسية” in Arabic requires two lines and 15 characters, while only one line and 4 characters are required in English. </p>

<p>Video game localization has some similarities with software localization. Both involve a combination of language translation and software engineering, that is, the translated text string needs to be properly placed in the software. This requires that the string length is within the allocated space, which in turn limits the freedom of translation. The model of releasing the original product (usually the English version) together with the localized version is an accepted model in today’s localization industry, but it has important implications for translation, because translators must deal with unstable source content that may be constantly changing throughout the project. Most games released in Europe seem to follow this model, rather than the model where the localized version lags behind the original version. The latter is common among Japanese game developers&#x2F;publishers.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Taboos-Haram"><a href="#Cultural-Taboos-Haram" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Taboos (Haram)"></a>Cultural Taboos (Haram)</h3><p>Arab culture is very conservative in terms of sex, alcohol, and profanity. In addition, in most cases, topics that violate Arab and Muslim cultural and religious beliefs will be reviewed by the Arab Audiovisual Commission (GCAM) for these issues. If the material cannot be reviewed, it will be completely banned. Several games have been banned in Arab countries due to content that does not conform to Arab cultural norms and traditions. For example, some video games that have been banned in the Arab region due to violence and mention of sexual orientation include <em>Assassin’s Creed 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>, <em>Deadpool</em>, and <em>Mafia 3</em>. There are also some other games that have been rejected or even banned by Arab players due to implicit or explicit insults to Muslims.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> is a good example. This game caused controversy in the Arab Muslim player community. Players found that the frame pattern above the toilet in a bathroom scene in the game quoted the Quran. In Islam, it is forbidden to talk about Islam in the toilet. In response to the player community, Activision officially apologized and modified this scene in a game update. </p>

<p>This is not the first time that Islamic elements have appeared in the Call of Duty series of games. In the zombie mode of <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, players found that the Quran was thrown on the floor and stepped on by players; such a rude scene angered players in the Arab region, forcing game developers to delete it in an update. Independent game developer Rami Ismail tweeted: “Even if you think religion is nonsense, there is no reason to be disrespectful to the culture and beliefs of 2 billion people in a video game, just in exchange for a disposable asset.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230220%2F596d184a-beae-48ee-8074-fae1a64d6ed0.png/size/"></p>

<p>When games are developing localized Arabic versions, development teams should carefully consider these issues. Development should follow the cultural norms of the Arabic-speaking region to avoid sales losses due to cultural dissonance and negative impact on the developer’s image in certain markets.</p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Localization is the process of making a product or information resonate with a specific target culture, in the same way that content is created locally. Several of the above-mentioned problems of Arabic localization can be reduced and avoided by adopting appropriate internationalization strategies. Game localization should also be based on Gouadec’s definition of localization, that is, adapting a product to “the specific physical, technical, linguistic, cultural, ethnic, religious, philosophical, commercial, marketing, etc. conditions and requirements of the audience or users of a specific ‘location’.”</p>
<p>In other words, the process of game localization should not only consider the language conversion of game resources, but also consider the cultural background of the corresponding market, including the corresponding norms to manage the acceptability of localization in overseas video game markets. These investments also depend on the level of localization that video game developers expect, the return on investment in localization based on time constraints, and considerations of the value of the target market. In general, given the huge market demand for video games from users in the Arab region, there is an urgent need for more research and experimentation in the field of Arabic game localization.</p>

    <title>The More Cowardly, the More Addicted - Are Horror Games Really That Appetizing</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Horror games, a genre that has endured since the birth of gaming, remain a favorite of many game enthusiasts. While our rational minds tell us to avoid fear in pursuit of happiness, the chilling, trembling feeling we get in the dark provides a thrilling and captivating experience.</p>
<p>Horror games are truly a love-hate affair. When you’re not playing them, you’re intrigued by the sense of curiosity, but when you are, you’re constantly gripped by fear.  From classics like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Outlast</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>, to the rising tide of Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em>, <em>Paper Dolls</em>, and <em>Paper Bride</em>, this genre has always had titles that touch players’ nerves.  Even when scared pale, players persevere to complete the entire story.  What is the driving force behind players’ dedication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F1cf04caa-4c02-4070-8488-3ba573afee74.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games"><a href="#1-What-Happens-in-Our-Bodies-When-We-Play-Horror-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?"></a>1. What Happens in Our Bodies When We Play Horror Games?</h2><h3 id="Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster"><a href="#Riding-the-Emotional-Rollercoaster" class="headerlink" title="Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster"></a>Riding the Emotional Rollercoaster</h3><p>Horror games aim to shock or frighten the audience through narrative devices such as pain and supernatural phenomena. Players experience anxiety and even disgust, accompanied by a series of physiological reactions, such as trembling, jumping, covering their eyes, and an increased heart rate, resulting in feelings of fear.  When faced with terror, the sympathetic nervous system is aroused, activating the fight-or-flight response, and the level of adrenaline in the body surges.  However, people usually don’t immediately flee danger. The brain assesses the surrounding environment, and after realizing there is no immediate danger, emotions relax, providing a sense of release.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s like a roller coaster. You experience a range of emotions, such as anticipation and tension, and then, under the stimulation of adrenaline, a series of physiological reactions occur, such as accelerated blood flow, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, dilated pupils, and focused attention on self-preservation. The brain and body prepare to react to perceived threats with greater strength and speed. After assessing that there is no real life-threatening danger, dopamine and endorphins are activated, resulting in a thrilling pleasure and mental catharsis.</p>
<p>Horror games take full advantage of this by manipulating and teasing the senses, scaring you, and then providing a moment of relief. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F639e7cda-5341-45e8-bf0b-264751299fa1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms"><a href="#Excitation-Transfer-and-Safe-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms"></a>Excitation Transfer and Safe Rooms</h3><p>Imagine you’re running for your life in the game world of <em>Resident Evil</em>, your health bar is almost empty, you don’t have many supplies left, and to make matters worse, there’s a猙狞 (zhēngníng - ferocious,狰狞) looking tracker who wants to kill you immediately following you.  At this point, you just want to run into the nearest safe room. When you hear the beautiful melody, you breathe a sigh of relief. This safe room design and the overwhelming sense of relief are actually key elements that make horror games appealing.  After experiencing an adrenaline rush and successfully escaping danger, with the release of dopamine, the player’s tension is relieved, muscles relax, and there is often an “electrified” effect after the fright.</p>
<p>Dolf Zillmann’s “Excitation-Transfer Theory” explains this cycle of tension and relief. Because horror games can effectively make players feel fear and unease, when they get rid of fear, the subsequent feeling of relief from excitement is amplified. This is why many games have safe room designs, not only to provide players with a safe haven from harm, but also to enhance the player’s emotions and strengthen the experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F86cecd5f-8094-4753-aecd-b05ff738967e.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts"><a href="#2-How-to-Awaken-the-Fear-in-Players’-Hearts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?"></a>2. How to Awaken the Fear in Players’ Hearts?</h2><p>So, since our bodies physiologically determine that when we face fear, a sense of excitement or fun will naturally follow the feeling of terror, how do games create horror?</p>
<p>In today’s horror games, even the traditional Western-style bloody and straightforward scares, which emphasize the visual horror created by zombies and mutants, are just auxiliary tools. Atmosphere and immersion are what games pursue, by finding resonance with players to achieve the purpose of engagement.</p>
<h3 id="Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions"><a href="#Environmental-Design-Such-as-Music-Creates-Illusions" class="headerlink" title="Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions"></a>Environmental Design, Such as Music, Creates Illusions</h3><p>Through modern medical scanning techniques, the brain regions involved in emotional processing, which in horror games correspond to fear recognition or processing, are most related to the amygdala and hippocampus. Horror games are not 100% jump scares and terrifying murders. Games like to leave you in suspense, which is where elements like suspense and sound design come into play.  When eerie music enters the ears, even without directly seeing terrifying images and things, it sends a signal to our nervous system, the amygdala is activated to produce fear. At this time, we don’t have any background clues to explain what we should be afraid of, and the hippocampus will retrieve memories and fill in the blanks based on our personal fears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F7bb137fc-2f5b-4594-b087-1d45355cd4c1.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories"><a href="#Awakening-the-Nightmares-Deep-in-Players’-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories"></a>Awakening the Nightmares Deep in Players’ Memories</h3><p>So, what are we afraid of in our memories?  Each cultural context has its own corresponding “nightmares”, such as the chainsaw murderers in Europe and America, Sadako in Japan, and Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil. These are often the design prototypes in various horror games. Or, like the ghost marriages and red candles and paper money in Chinese horror, we instinctively feel a chill and our hearts race.  For example, most people are afraid of dimly lit environments, sudden ringing phones, baby cries, and other scenes, which are guaranteed to scare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Fdd26971f-807a-41bb-83b7-58e94d76a9e6.png/size/"></p>
<p>The most terrifying things often happen in familiar areas. When a horror game takes place in a familiar building, and the game creates a depressing atmosphere, accompanied by a slow-paced early game and a large number of puzzle-solving elements, then it gives the player a fatal blow at the climax of the plot.  Although there are not so many sensory stimuli, it will make you replay it in your mind.  This chilling fear is the most charming part of psychological horror, making countless players “unable to stop”.</p>
<h2 id="3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players"><a href="#3-Emerging-Media-Further-Attract-Players" class="headerlink" title="3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players"></a>3. Emerging Media Further Attract Players</h2><p>In recent years, the resurgence of horror games, and the reboot trend, is also thanks to the rise of the streaming industry.</p>
<p>Horror games seem to be born for streaming, naturally suitable for creating content. Streamers have also perfectly interpreted “the more cowardly, the more addicted”. This has further promoted the prevalence of horror games in the streaming industry. After all, which streamer doesn’t like outstanding “streaming effects”?  Unlike other games, narrative-based games require the entire playthrough to be watched for story appreciation, and strategy games require long-term experience to truly engage. Horror games are different. When streamers show their off-guard reactions on screen, it brings a strong sense of comedic contrast to the audience, while also driving traffic for the streamer and providing free advertising for the game, allowing horror games, which were once niche and only suitable for private experience, to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>For example, popular Chinese horror games like <em>Home Sweet Home</em> and <em>Paper Dolls</em> have been played by well-known streamers like PDD, Qiezi, and even some esports players during their streams.  Or, when searching for horror games on Bilibili, you will also find many videos of streamers playing or explaining the game.  The rise of new media such as live streaming and video has indeed injected a boost into the horror industry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F64aabcd3-1b88-4822-b5ad-2dbf10e5901c.png/size/"></p>
<p>As a viewer, when you have a favorite streamer who screams in terror while playing this game, you will naturally be interested in this game and take the initiative to learn about horror games. Human emotions are interconnected, and joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness can easily be spread to others through various forms. As a viewer, I might be scared to play, but I’m definitely not afraid to watch a stream.  When the streamer is startled, the audience will also feel their palms sweat, which is also a kind of emotional connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort"><a href="#4-Beware-of-Physiological-Discomfort" class="headerlink" title="4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort"></a>4. Beware of Physiological Discomfort</h2><p>Horror games, as a broad category, may include various gameplay forms in their core. However, in the external presentation of these games, developers need to be wary of cruel and extreme art design. Causing players physiological discomfort may detract from the visual experience.  From the terrifying presentation of monsters, the basic principles of their construction, and the player’s coping methods, more in-depth design should be carried out, and early combination with player testing for corresponding adjustments can reduce the risk of negative reviews in later releases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F5f04f593-8306-4502-97e1-661b709e543d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Last December, <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, created by the main creators of <em>Dead Space</em>, was released and was considered by many players to be the spiritual successor to <em>Dead Space</em>. Although in terms of art design, the development team fully utilized the performance of next-generation consoles, and based on the company’s strengths (the producer is an art director), the visual effects were greatly improved, but some players experienced physiological discomfort and the singular horror and combat experience created by the game did not receive very good reviews.</p>
<h2 id="5-Will-Horror-Continue"><a href="#5-Will-Horror-Continue" class="headerlink" title="5. Will Horror Continue?"></a>5. Will Horror Continue?</h2><p>For a game, repeatedly stacking horror elements does not guarantee success. As mentioned above, when players enter the feedback loop of expecting fear, sudden fright, and releasing happiness in the safe room, the fear response is constantly triggered.  This feedback loop often exists in every horror game. After you face a hellhound that has scared you once, the second time you encounter a similar scene, your brain is prepared for that moment, just like a drug, you develop “tolerance.”</p>
<p>When we activate the fight-or-flight response, a complex neurotransmitter response is activated, producing a neurochemical cascade. Like drugs, long-term use requires more of the drug to produce the effect.  Thrill-seeking players may also develop increased “fear tolerance,” thus requiring more and more fear stimulation to produce the desired response.</p>
<p>As most players say, a certain game has nothing new and is always “rehashing old ideas”. For horror games, if they want to endure and win the hearts of players, they also need to change the way they scare, otherwise players will only say “this plot design is the same as xxx”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ffb714065-c86c-4d89-9a28-4bcec46fb00a.png/size/"></p>
<p>Currently, many horror games have attracted a lot of attention. However, the cruel fact contrary to high popularity is that most current horror games are critically acclaimed but not commercially successful. The reason is still simply “scares”.  They are both afraid and curious, so instead of playing themselves, most people prefer to watch others play with the protection of bullet comments (referring to live comments that scroll across the screen on streaming platforms).</p>
<p>But now, with more expressive forms and gameplay attracting players to horror games, more and more players want to try them.  Initially, they may be scared and develop resistance to the game, but now, after seeing new and unique horror elements and gameplay, they may develop new interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps horror games still cannot shake the market position of other game genres, but under the trend of the times, horror games still have great potential. We also look forward to more powerful technology, more diverse scenes and gameplay being introduced into horror games. </p>

    <title>How Can Interface and Interaction Help Players Quickly Get Started with a New Game</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230222/28584_1074591.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Besides the game’s own fun and playability, the speed at which novice players get started is also one of the major factors that determine the fate of a game. In the player’s onboarding phase, the game designer has a lot of information that needs to be communicated to the player, including the story background, game goals, basic operations, etc., which is the so-called “novice guidance”. The transmission of such information requires interaction designers to make ingenious designs to ensure its accuracy and fluency, so as to minimize the player’s memory burden, improve acceptance and onboarding efficiency, and then make the player have the willingness to continue playing.</p>
<p>This article will discuss several key points of interaction design that need to be paid attention to in novice guidance, and analyze them in combination with cases.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative"><a href="#1-The-Importance-of-Novice-Guidance-Weakly-Positive-Strongly-Negative" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative"></a>1. The Importance of Novice Guidance: Weakly Positive, Strongly Negative</h2><p>First, we need to understand two related concepts. “Weakly positive” and “strongly negative”.</p>
<p>“Weakly positive” means that it is extremely difficult for novice guidance to gain the attention and favor of players. Although excellent novice guidance will allow players to complete the onboarding phase efficiently and smoothly, and have a willingness to continue playing the game, because it is a guide when entering a game, it does not occupy a dominant position like the game’s own plot advancement, so players do not often pay attention to this novice guidance, nor do they often pay attention to the changes in their attitude towards the game during this stage, and they do not often make positive comments such as “the novice guidance of this game is really good”.</p>
<p>“Strongly negative” means that if a novice guide is not done well, it is very likely to directly dissuade novice players. Novice guidance is equivalent to the gate of the whole game. If the threshold is too high, or the receptionist is too tough, leading visitors to visit hand in hand, and so on, visitors are very likely to become dissatisfied and leave. Novice guidance receives less attention, but it is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance"><a href="#2-Interaction-Points-and-Guidance-Method-Analysis-in-Novice-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance"></a>2. Interaction Points and Guidance Method Analysis in Novice Guidance</h2><h3 id="Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance"><a href="#Non-mandatory-Open-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Non-mandatory: Open Guidance"></a>Non-mandatory: Open Guidance</h3><p>When encountering a new game, players often encounter “nanny-level” novice tutorials - the screen pauses, a conspicuous arrow appears on the interface to guide the player to click here (and only this place is interactive, unable to exit), and there are text descriptions of varying lengths. Obviously, this method is too rigid and will easily reduce the player’s favorability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some players may have already learned about the game through other accounts, watching game videos, etc., so they do not need to learn the novice guidance, which designers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, good novice guidance interaction should be non-mandatory and open. Players can freely explore in the game scene and spontaneously complete the learning of interaction methods. Of course, in some games under specific categories, or in some parts of the game’s novice guidance, mandatory guidance is more applicable, because this form can relatively effectively ensure that all players master and understand certain key mechanisms or story plots.</p>
<p>For example, in the game <em>Stray</em>, the play between kittens is used as the beginning of the story. Because it was raining at that time, the kittens’ activities were limited to the cave that could shelter from the rain, but in this space, players can freely explore and learn basic actions such as walking and interacting with other cats. Except for the necessary key prompts, there are no obvious interactions set in this scene, and players seem to have integrated into the open world of cats without human language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2F91faa065-cf58-46e2-9eb3-523658c8cffb.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Rainy night, players freely interact with NPCs in the cave</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Learning-Through-Practice"><a href="#Learning-Through-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Learning Through Practice"></a>Learning Through Practice</h3><p>Novice tutorials are not necessarily textbook-like systematic teaching. It can also break through the inherent form and integrate into actual combat, learning through practice. Therefore, what we describe as “novice tutorials” may be more appropriately referred to as “novice guidance”. Players gradually learn a variety of skills and gameplay as the plot progresses, which is very helpful for the smoothness and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Necessary prompts and interactions should be integrated into the scene, which can be viewed by players at any time, and hardly affect the progress of their game.</p>
<p>In <em>Human Fall Flat</em>, there is no formed novice tutorial, but learning while playing. When players play for the first time, they will fall into one of the pre-selected maps - Mansion (of course it is the simplest of all maps), and directly start exploring the game world. During the process, players will occasionally encounter conspicuous orange items on the ground. When it is picked up, a projection screen-like floating animation appears in the scene, teaching players the relevant operations at this moment. Whether to pick it up and when to put it down is entirely up to the player, respecting and encouraging players to explore on their own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230222%2Ffe0dee3f-39a7-4e39-a813-5d60adf74762.gif/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Toto Temple Deluxe</em>, there is a very important dash action, which needs to be pressed “arrow keys + dash key” to complete. The training of this action has already begun before the game - game settings, mode selection and other preparations all need to control the villain to dash to complete the interaction. </p>

<h3 id="Ingenious-Unconscious-Design"><a href="#Ingenious-Unconscious-Design" class="headerlink" title="Ingenious Unconscious Design"></a>Ingenious Unconscious Design</h3><p>To make the novice guidance more brilliant, it is necessary to design more hidden teaching elements and methods that players are not aware of.</p>
<p>Unconscious action is an action that a person can make without much thought and subconsciously. Unconscious design is an extremely simple design that captures this natural characteristic of users. It does not require a lot of artificially added interaction, and can quickly guide users to unconsciously complete a certain task. Applying it to the game novice tutorial can be roughly summarized as: using natural and ingenious implicit interaction to guide players.</p>
<p>In <em>Stray</em>, cans begin to appear on the kitten’s path, prompting the player to push them down from a height. At first, this action did not produce any feedback from the event. When the player was confused, they thought of the reality that kittens are like this, unreasonably pushing things off the table, cute and mischievous. This method not only evokes a strong resonance from the player, but also teaches the player the correct use of cans in the game. Then, a glass skylight blocked the way, and there happened to be a can on the high platform above it… </p>

<p>After clicking the confirm button in the <em>Mega Man X</em> menu, a small animation of the protagonist shooting a bullet will appear on the left side of the button.

<p>Like the teaching of all knowledge and skills, game tutorials cannot output all the gameplay and rules of this game to novice players at once. When they first come into contact with new things, players need a process of understanding and acceptance. In this process, the game designer leads the player from easy to difficult, from simple to complex, and gradually enters the worldview of this game.</p>
<p>For example, one of the important contents of the ocean exploration game <em>Dave The Diver</em> is to go to the sea to fish. The game first teaches players the most basic left-click stab, and then long-press the right-click to shoot the harpoon, and then gradually teaches players to use various complex weapons. The number of skills mastered by players steadily increases during this period, and it is easier to obtain a sense of phased achievement. </p>

<p>● <strong>Designer: Pay Attention to Interface Cleanliness and Logic</strong></p>
<p>Phased teaching can better prompt designers to pay special attention to the conciseness and logic of information transmission.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that if the designer has not paid attention to this principle, it is very likely that a large amount of information will appear on the same interface at the same time in the game, making the player unable to start, not knowing which panel to read first, and what is the relationship between them.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the designer understands the principle of phased teaching from beginning to end, he will split, classify, and present the complicated information on this panel to novice players step by step according to a certain event logic. In this way, the process of players getting started with a new game will be more interlocked, like reading a story.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Game types can be subdivided almost infinitely, and there are too many to enumerate. Although many novice guidance principles are generally applicable to different games, it is not difficult to find some differences when comparing them carefully. For example, action-oriented games focus on the training of skills and combos, which may be integrated into various corners that players cannot imagine; puzzle-adventure games focus on allowing players to explore spontaneously, so as to minimize obvious guidance.</p>
<p>Excellent game novice tutorials need to respect the needs of players, allow players to explore on their own in a relatively free space, and naturally integrate prompts or interactions into the scene when necessary. In this way, the novice tutorial is sublimated, no longer in its inherent form, but perfectly integrated with the game itself, even reaching the level that players can hardly realize that this is a kind of teaching. Players gradually learn specific skills during the game, step by step, significantly improving the efficiency of getting started, and can more deeply experience the sense of phased achievement.</p>

    <title>Achievement Systems and IntrinsicExtrinsic Motivation – Do Players Really Need Trophies</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since Microsoft pioneered the achievement system in the early 20th century, game achievement systems have been an important part of the gaming community, but there have also been many questions. Game achievement systems were born as a tool to promote player engagement, but they have turned many players into pure “achievement hunters”. Do players really need achievement systems? From the perspective of motivation in psychology, perhaps we can get some different thoughts and inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="1-Do-players-really-need-trophies"><a href="#1-Do-players-really-need-trophies" class="headerlink" title="1. Do players really need trophies?"></a>1. Do players really need trophies?</h2><p>Two months ago, Fredrik Thylander, lead game designer at Ubisoft Massive, said this on Twitter: “Unpopular opinion: achievements&#x2F;trophies have been bad for gaming. It narrows games, it disrupts and diverts attention, it eats resources that could have made the game better.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F10e03acd-567a-44e2-a50a-e18fd1d21c76.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Fredrik Thylander’s tweet on Twitter received attention from more than 200,000 players</em></p>
<p>Thylander’s speech sparked a lot of discussion among players, with both supporters and opponents. Supporters believe that achievements make players play games only for achievements. Many players don’t even enjoy the game well. They just open the guide and get one platinum trophy or achievement point after another. Some opponents believe that the existence of the game achievement system provides them with a goal to play the game, otherwise they may never challenge those high-difficulty or racing-type gameplays.</p>
<p>The good and bad of the achievement system is certainly not a monistic point of view. At least for many game developers and platforms, the existence of the achievement system has become an inseparable part. It can effectively extend the life of the game, guide players to experience the complete game design content, and provide players with a simple and direct game goal and positive feedback. But for players, the achievement system is not an insignificant prompt that pops up at the bottom of the game interface. As an external incentive mechanism, it profoundly affects the player’s motivation for the game. More and more players are beginning to question: Do we really need achievements?</p>
<h2 id="2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect"><a href="#2-Intrinsic-Extrinsic-Motivation-and-the-Overjustification-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect"></a>2. Intrinsic&#x2F;Extrinsic Motivation and the Overjustification Effect</h2><p>The birth of the achievement system can be traced back to the 1980s Activision game <em>Chopper Command</em>, whose gameplay is very common flight shooting. But what’s more special is that if the player’s game score exceeds 10,000 points, the player can take a photo or video and exchange it for a special physical game badge from Activision. However, physical achievements are still a bit cumbersome, and soon achievements began to shift to the form of “electronic certificates”. The 1990 puzzle game <em>E-Motion</em> designed 5 “achievements” in the game. Players can get game points by completing all levels, which is the prototype of today’s achievement system.</p>
<p>The first cross-game achievement system was born in 2005, when Microsoft first launched the Gamerscore system on Xbox 360. Players can earn achievement points by completing game achievements on the platform, and points from different games can be accumulated. Subsequently, in 2008, Sony changed the score to a more intuitive trophy system. One achievement corresponds to one trophy. Players can unlock the platinum trophy as long as they obtain all achievements. Compared with points, trophies can more directly represent the player’s game completion and have become one of the most representative features on the PS platform. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe1823c92-eb25-4681-8c97-78235b590e88.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Trophy levels on PS: The player’s level is determined according to the quality and number of trophies obtained by the player)</em></p>
<p>Of course, players who play console games all year round also know that Nintendo games do not have an achievement system. In this regard, then-Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto said: “I don’t like to use external factors to attract people to invest time in games. I hope players play games just because they enjoy the game.”</p>
<p>The game concepts of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo correspond to the external motivation and internal motivation of players to play games.</p>
<p><em>Extrinsic motivation</em> means that a person chooses to participate in an activity not because they like it very much, or because it can make you feel satisfied, but because this activity can bring some kind of reward or avoid some kind of punishment; <em>Intrinsic motivation</em> is directly related to the activity itself. Because doing something can stimulate people’s interest and make people happy, the activity itself is the goal pursued by the actor.</p>
<p>In recent years, many designers or players have questioned the value of the achievement system, largely because: as an external motivation provided by the manufacturer, game trophies can easily form an <em>overjustification effect</em>, reducing the player’s internal motivation.</p>
<p>The research on the overjustification effect began in the 1970s. In 1971, Edward Deci, a psychology professor at the University of Rochester, invited two groups of college students to complete intelligence tests. Experimental group subjects could get $1 reward for each problem solved, while control group subjects had no reward. Then observe whether the two groups of subjects will continue to solve problems after the test is over. The results found that although the experimental group worked very hard to solve problems, they obviously lost interest in solving problems after the test was over; while the control group would continue to solve problems after the test was over.</p>
<p>The overjustification effect represents the damage of external motivation to internal motivation. If too many external rewards are used to motivate individuals to do something they are willing to do, it will reduce their internal motivation. Because this will make this individual think that his motivation for behavior comes from the outside, and once the external motivation is lost, the individual will not continue to engage in this behavior.</p>
<p>In 2010, a speech at the Global Game Developers Conference (GDC), “Achievements Considered Harmful?”, proposed the harmful impact of the achievement system on players from this perspective. Achievements themselves exist as external incentives for the game, but with the achievement system, the game motivation of many players will gradually shift to unlocking trophies in the game. Players may gradually lose their love for the game on the way to unlocking trophies, and become pure “achievement hunters” or “platinum hunters”.</p>
<p>Platinum trophies provide a goal for many players, but they also limit many players to just getting trophies and showing them off on social media.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements"><a href="#3-What-kind-of-achievements-are-“good”-achievements" class="headerlink" title="3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?"></a>3. What kind of achievements are “good” achievements?</h2><p>Since external motivation will damage the internal motivation of the game, should we completely abandon the achievement system?</p>
<p>In the study of the motivation system, Deci further tested the impact of “verbal rewards” on task motivation, and found that, compared with those without feedback, students who were told “you did a good job” showed an increase in intrinsic motivation on subsequent tasks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the overjustification effect is not inevitable. With more and more research, scholars have given clearer results on the relationship between external motivation and internal motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Non-contingent external rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can only be obtained when the activity results reach a certain level) cause less damage to intrinsic motivation and produce more promotion than those <em>contingent rewards</em> (i.e., rewards that can be obtained as long as the activity is carried out);</p>
<p>  Non-contingent external rewards and contingent rewards correspond to two different types of achievements: assessment achievements and contingent achievements. <em>Assessment achievement</em> means that players will only be given specific rewards if they achieve a certain standard, such as our more common high-difficulty clearance achievements or level ratings. <em>Contingent achievement</em> is a reward that players will inevitably be given as long as they complete a certain event or process. Process rewards mostly belong to this.</p>
<p>  Because of their low acquisition difficulty, contingent achievements are difficult to form effective positive feedback on player behavior. At the same time, in recent years, the overall game difficulty has become more friendly, and necessary achievements are easily overused, which instead easily attracts players to focus on trophies rather than the game itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Unexpected rewards</em> have a greater positive effect on intrinsic motivation than <em>expected rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  This division actually involves the design problem of the achievement system itself - should we hide the achievements or completely display them to the player. Aside from achievements hidden to avoid spoilers, most game achievements are still mainly explicit. Explicit achievements provide players with a relatively clear goal and a preliminary understanding of the game. Players are also more likely to simply plan their game path through game achievements. For example, in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, in addition to the conventional high-difficulty clearance achievements, some fancy clearance achievements will also be explicitly shown to players - the creator implies that players can choose to continuously increase the difficulty level of the game, or choose to challenge some strange clearance methods.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F37f49a7f-c1ed-4df7-b857-0e455eddfe2c.png/size/"></p>
<pre><code>*(Fancy clearance achievements in the rogue-like card game &quot;Slay the Spire&quot;)*

Compared with explicit achievements, hidden achievements appear less frequently in games, but they have a better promoting effect on players&#39; internal motivation. Not letting players know the specific trophy content in advance, and giving players rewards when players accidentally trigger or curiously try some new content, can stimulate players&#39; game fun more than directly telling players the achievement content. Because this kind of unexpected feedback is based on the player&#39;s own playing motivation, it will also encourage players to make more attempts and &quot;unorthodox&quot; gameplay.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Intangible external rewards</em> produce more promotion and less weakening than <em>tangible rewards</em>;</p>
<p>  It is not appropriate to use intangible and tangible descriptions to evaluate the achievement system. After all, platinum trophies are not really “platinum”. For the achievement system, tangible&#x2F;intangible actually lies in whether the achievement system carries other external values in addition to game incentives and self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>  For example, for many players, full achievements have always had a strong social significance.</p>
<p>  From the perspective of the game platform, the achievement system generally exists as part of the community system. You can clearly see the number of platinum trophies of this player in the PS personal profile; there is also a special “achievement showcase” on Steam for players to display their achievements. Single-player games themselves naturally lack interaction between players. For the core players of the platform, they always need something to show their “noble status”. This is also why single-player games pay more attention to the achievement system than online games. After all, online games have levels, combat power, and appearance, and single-player players want to prove that they are superior, and there is almost no other way but trophies.</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F9bca9588-bc41-4314-9384-e1c8e8e2cf60.jpg/size/"></p>
<pre><code>In addition, when the platinum trophy has become a matter of &quot;competitiveness&quot;, the nature of the matter will change differently.

There is a website called Astats, which will count the game achievements of the Steam platform in real time, as well as the number of achievements completed by players, and give rankings, providing an off-game PVP standard for steam achievement hunters. What kind of demand there is, there is what kind of product. There are many achievement-hunting games on Steam, represented by *Achievement Hunter*. Players basically only need to do nothing and hang up for two hours to unlock more than a thousand achievements in the game. These &quot;games&quot; themselves only serve the external value of achievements, and players no longer have any internal motivation for the game itself.

&amp;nbsp;

<pre><code>*(Achievement ranking on the Astats website, the highest-ranked player has completed 1.64 million achievements)*
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Returning to our opening question, do players really need achievements? We might as well use a sentence from Hegel to answer this question:</p>
<p>“What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.”</p>
<p>The gamerscore system, introduced in 2005, was intended to help boost activity among players and to get them to talk to each other more about the games.  Two years later, Xbox 360 product manager Aaron Greenberg said, “And we found out that a lot of people were playing Xbox games a lot because we offered points and the other platforms didn’t.”</p>
<p>At least for most players now, the achievement system is still an inseparable part of the game itself. At the end of last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em> landed on Steam, and many negative reviews came from the fact that the game did not have an achievement system.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a big deal to have no achievements. Nintendo has always maintained an indifferent attitude towards achievements. They can add 999 “Korok Seeds” in Zelda. Whether players choose to collect them and how much they collect depends entirely on personal wishes. Therefore, for players, how to design achievements is far more important than whether there are achievements.</p>
<p>As an external motivation to motivate players, the achievement system itself has the risk of overjustification effect. However, adding moderate assessment achievements and hidden achievements to the game can not only avoid the overjustification effect, but also further stimulate the player’s internal motivation. Although it is difficult for us to avoid the existence of achievement PVP, most platforms now provide options to hide achievements or trophies. When we want to truly experience the game, we may also choose to turn on the options.</p>

    <title>How to Apply Gestalt Principles in Game Interface Design</title>

<h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2><p>Although the user interface in video games is not the most shining part of the game, it carries the important function of conveying information to the player. In the process of industry development, the game content has become more and more rich, carrying more functions, and the elements on the interface are inevitably increasing. And how to organize their arrangement to clearly and intuitively convey information to players has gradually become an important proposition.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, three German psychologists established the Gestalt Principle based on the study of apparent motion. They applied the Gestalt Principle to aesthetics in a specific way, combined it with various psychological processes, and promoted aesthetic research with Gestalt tendencies.</p>
<p>And now, this principle can also well guide the design of game interfaces. This article will explain the eight principles of “Gestalt Principle” and their application in the game field one by one, to see how this nearly century-old law has insight into people’s perception of interface elements and applied it to game interface design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F07f61e91-6298-45cd-a9e5-0a15ddefdda3.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-GESTALT-Gestalt-Principles"><a href="#2-GESTALT-Gestalt-Principles" class="headerlink" title="2. GESTALT: Gestalt Principles"></a>2. GESTALT: Gestalt Principles</h2><p>“The whole is something else than the sum of its parts.”——Kurt Koffka</p>
<p>First, we need to understand what the Gestalt Principles are.</p>
<p>The Gestalt Principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when perceiving shapes. It was founded by German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka in the 1930s. Its name “GESTALT” is a German word, translated as “shape”. It is the principle&#x2F;law of human perception. Gestalt psychologists emphasize that people perceive the overall form of graphics, not just individual elements. Therefore, if you want to summarize it in one sentence, it is Kurt Koffka’s “The whole is something else than the sum of its parts.” Interestingly, this famous saying is often mistranslated as Aristotle’s “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” which made Koffka himself laugh and cry.</p>
<p>In the long process of development and supplementation, the Gestalt Principles have also developed into a total of eight detailed principles, which describe the phenomenon of humans simplifying complex images when perceiving shapes in different situations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fcb22797e-2ec0-49a5-8fc9-39d341e581cc.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Similarity"><a href="#Similarity" class="headerlink" title="Similarity"></a>Similarity</h3><p>The definition of the principle of similarity is: when elements have the same visual characteristics, people think that these elements have a certain connection. These visual characteristics can include color, shape, size, font, texture, and so on.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that color is a particularly strong visual feature, and its effect on visual perception can often overwhelm other visual features and change the user’s perception of the whole. For example, in the figure below, observers tend to identify the following graphics as three rows or four columns based on the similarity of shapes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F7c1e18ca-bedf-4d56-9f1f-142259d3cbff.png/size/"></p>
<p>However, if colors are added to the elements irregularly on the basis of the original image, observers will naturally think that the blue elements are a group and the white elements are a group. It can be seen that color has a dominant power in perception. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fea1b38d2-58f7-4221-84f8-311b3e52a6a0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, cleverly using the similarity of visual elements in the game can greatly help players understand the functions of game elements and the connections between them without the need for extra teaching.</p>
<p>In the action music game <em>HiFi RUSH</em>, the protagonist Chai’s team will gradually welcome new partners during the adventure: the blue-clothed girl Peppermint, the green strong man Macaron, and the red-haired girl Korsica. All three have their own unique abilities to assist Chai in battle in the game and exploration outside the game. For example, the green strongman Macaron can break the green shield, and the red-haired girl Korsica can blow out the flames ejected by red enemies, and also overclock the red generator to assist exploration. Through the correspondence of colors, the correspondence between the partner color - monster color - exploration mechanism color in the game is clear at a glance, clearly and intuitively reducing the player’s cognitive load. </p>

<h3 id="Proximity"><a href="#Proximity" class="headerlink" title="Proximity"></a>Proximity</h3><p>The definition of the proximity principle is: we tend to think of elements that are close together as a group or the same object, and other separated elements as another group or object. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F435ca855-d7e0-44d7-86d0-7f3181730585.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the figure above, the three stripes of the revised Logo on the left are far apart from each other, and cannot be considered as the same whole; but if the three stripes are placed very close, they obviously form a whole, forming a classic graphic with strong recognition.</p>
<p><em>Battlefield 1</em> is set in the battlefield of World War I. It is an FPS game that focuses on large-scale tactical competition. The battlefield can accommodate large-scale firefights of up to 32VS32. In the scoreboard page of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the design of the proximity principle is well adhered to, so that the information of up to 64 people can be clearly presented, grouped, and perceived on the same page.</p>
<p>In the scoreboard interface of <em>Battlefield 1</em>, the designer first uses the vertical line + white space in the middle to divide the players into two major parts according to their camp.</p>
<p>For the data arrangement within each camp, in the horizontal direction, the data is divided into two major sections by proximity: off-game information and in-game information. Off-game information includes player level, player ID, etc., which are closely arranged on the left; in-game information includes captain star, troop type, KD data, score data, player delay, etc., which are closely or sparsely arranged on the right according to their relevance. In the vertical direction, the information of each player is closely arranged together, so that players can browse a certain piece of data at a glance, and convey the visual metaphor of close unity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ff5901a23-2e9e-4d28-a9f9-112db7cdd2e7.png/size/"></p>

<p>It is worth noting that since different resolutions will squeeze the white space between components to different degrees, designers need to carefully design them for application in different adaptation resolutions to maintain the correct relative proximity relationship between components under various resolutions.</p>
<h3 id="Closure"><a href="#Closure" class="headerlink" title="Closure"></a>Closure</h3><p>The definition of the closure principle is: when people observe familiar visual images, they will perceive incomplete local images as a whole image. This perceptual ending is called closure.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic IBM logo in the figure below, we always perceive it as three letters at the first time, rather than several horizontally arranged rectangles and trapezoids. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F2899285f-c816-4dac-93da-a7d991a8407e.png/size/"></p>
<p>And the following two pictures are not black pentagons and cones scattered everywhere, but a football and a spiked ball that naturally appear in your mind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ff799effa-1ea3-4c2c-a6f1-6ce157cf2434.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F28df6e4b-400b-4e32-bacb-a9b6e5c89a2a.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>In video games, the principle of closure is also widely used in icon design, animation design, and other fields, subtly influencing users’ cognition behind the user interface:</p>
<p>Friends who have played <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> will not be unfamiliar with the following icon. It is the icon located in the lower right corner of the game loading interface, which means “loading”. The design of the icon fully utilizes the principle of closure. Although the dragon scales moving in the upper left and lower right corners are not connected into a circle, it is easy for players to imagine a majestic dragon circling around the rising sun. The giant dragon with only part of its body exposed also adds a touch of mystery, which secretly matches the psychological feeling of “Wo Long” (Crouching Dragon) hidden in the dark and蓄势待发 (poised for action). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F989c025d-955a-488e-af3c-a043c1ad0f64.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Connectedness"><a href="#Connectedness" class="headerlink" title="Connectedness"></a>Connectedness</h3><p>The definition of the connectedness principle is: when elements are connected to each other, they are perceived as part of the same unit.</p>
<p>The connectedness principle is relatively strong, and even overwhelms the proximity principle in the example in the figure below: According to the proximity principle, we will regard 23, 45, and 67 as a whole. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F4071d431-7bda-449f-9e91-7968beda16b1.png/size/"></p>
<p>But just by connecting a few magical lines in it, we will naturally regard 12, 34, 56, and 78 as a whol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fcbb9dc08-1905-4c10-b808-4558dedac132.png/size/"></p>
<p>Such characteristics are often used on the tabs of the game menu bar. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is an open-world game set in medieval Europe. In the menu bar of this game, the tabs will be displayed in a darker gray color when they are not selected, and are separated from the main content list; the selected tabs will maintain the same color as the content list, and bridge the dividing line between the two, displaying as a complete parchment, so that players can clearly perceive that the current menu is the “food” menu. In order to fit the background era, the border and list of the game interface use stone brick material and parchment texture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ff470a5bd-8669-4b16-858d-81814c61b4a0.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Common-Fate"><a href="#Common-Fate" class="headerlink" title="Common Fate"></a>Common Fate</h3><p>The definition of the principle of common fate is: elements that move in the same direction and at the same rate are more easily identified as a whole.</p>
<p>The principle of common fate is the only one of the eight principles that involves movement and animation. Because of this, its influence on graphic recognition is extraordinary. For example, when cards slide, each card maintains the same direction and speed of movement, and the drop-down menu options expand vertically at the same rate, which are common designs on mobile Internet applications. By keeping the movement synchronized, designers can help users understand the relationship of grouped elements, thereby reducing the user’s cognitive burden. Similarly, when designers need to distinguish two elements, they only need to distinguish their movements to produce a great effect.</p>
<p><em>Devil May Cry V</em> is a masterpiece of ACT games, and its scoring system is a representative part of the series. In the chapter scoring animation of Devil May Cry, the first three scoring sub-items slide out to the right at the same rate. Without other information, players can perceive the parallel relationship between the three items in a whole; while the last item, the total score, although in the same direction, slides at a relatively slow rate, effectively distinguishing it from the scoring sub-items, and arousing the player’s expectations with a longer pre-appearance, further enhancing the positive feedback after knowing the score. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fc70b5a0d-55d7-441f-8558-043f3d209f09.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Continuity"><a href="#Continuity" class="headerlink" title="Continuity"></a>Continuity</h3><p>The principle of continuity states that elements arranged on continuous smooth lines are more relevant than elements on straight lines or curves.</p>
<p>The principle of continuity mainly refers to the influence of whether the curvature change of the line is sharp on the overall perception. In the figure below, the observer’s line of sight is likely to follow two routes: a smooth curve from top left to bottom right, or a horizontal straight line from left to right. In other words: as long as the curvature changes of the intersecting lines are significantly sharp enough, the possibility of confusing the two lines will be reduced. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fdbba0862-1162-4767-9258-c72e5cf69f17.png/size/"></p>
<p>The 2016 Independent Games Festival award-winning work <em>Mini Metro</em> is a puzzle strategy game where players need to build an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly developing city over time. Even though the game has removed most of the redundant elements on the interface, there are still a considerable number of subway lines crossing each other in the later stages of the game. However, <em>Mini Metro</em> goes against the principle of continuity, designing the shapes of subway lines to be angular, and using bold colors to distinguish them, so that players will hardly spend effort in distinguishing between two lines, while keeping the arrangement of game elements elegant and clear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fa08357c4-fcaf-49fa-8bf2-e2a6c839edbb.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Figure-Ground"><a href="#Figure-Ground" class="headerlink" title="Figure&#x2F;Ground"></a>Figure&#x2F;Ground</h3><p>The Figure&#x2F;Ground principle states that people instinctively decompose graphics, photos, logos, websites, movie screens, and other actual life scenes into “figure” and “ground”, thereby simplifying the image, saving time, and reducing cognitive burden. The most famous and intuitive example is an interesting optical illusion art, the Rubin vase designed by Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin in 1915: whether the subject of the picture is a vase or a face depends on whether you see the graphic as white or black. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe68e6147-f694-46fc-8d04-9be780d500bd.png/size/"></p>
<p>For designers, the most important thing is to clearly distinguish between the figure and the ground in order to guide attention to the key elements of the interface, provide visual cues, and prevent any confusion for the user, thereby keeping the user’s attention on the key information.</p>
<p>In <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em>, players will reach the Banner of Chivalry point for rest after a battle. At this time, the game is paused, and external dangers will not affect the protagonist. <em>Wo Long</em> then performs grayscale and semi-transparent processing on the game screen of the big world at this time, turning it into the “background” in the visual relationship. At this time, the player’s attention is also attracted to the more critical camp rest operation that has become the “figure”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F542192cd-5d13-4f08-b0b5-6cf3a5ed46d7.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="Common-Region"><a href="#Common-Region" class="headerlink" title="Common Region"></a>Common Region</h3><p>The Common Region principle states: elements within a boundary are perceived as a group and are assumed to have a common feature or function.</p>
<p>The Common Region principle usually overrides weaker principles, such as the proximity principle or the similarity principle. Therefore, when designers deal with a variety of UI elements or have no space to adjust the white space, the Common Region principle will become a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>For example, in the table below, due to the proximity principle, the table below may be misinterpreted as classifying information by category, arranging it in columns, and dividing the three types of information of “University”, “Country”, and “Time Zone” into three groups. At this time, the proximity principle may interfere with your judgment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F8e5c1cf8-25b2-4d56-aa6d-17907d6f1464.png/size/"></p>
<p>But when the designer adds spaced zebra stripes to them, the overall relationship is very clear: each group of “University”, “Country”, and “Time Zone” information is arranged in a row relationship, expressing the country and time zone where each university is located. Even if the row spacing is much smaller than the column spacing, the observer will not misinterpret it as arranged in columns. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F20691448-983e-463d-b926-418b60cead56.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After adding zebra stripes, can you recognize which information is a group faster?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In video games, which have a richer form of information transmission, the Common Region principle has more multi-dimensional means. The game map of <em>The Division</em> is divided into multiple areas. When the area is irregular and there is no space for white space, the designer uses the flickering effect of the area filling and the red borders that separate each other to clearly and directly depict the current area and the dividing line between different areas, and also integrates the uneven buildings in the map into abstract areas named by humans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fd0be2700-ca73-4582-968b-c4bec86b0cdc.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Division</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>The Gestalt Principle is already a “centenarian”. Since its introduction, it has been widely used in graphic design, product design, website design, and other fields. As a general design principle and guideline, it helps designers create more attractive, easy-to-understand, and organized designs. The idea of “the whole is not the sum of its parts” contained in it has not become outdated due to the changes of the times. Instead, it has stood firm in the long river of time and has endured for a long time.</p>
<p>As a new art form, games have added the dimension of interaction in addition to vision and hearing. The new characteristics and new problems in them are very worthy of scrutiny. The laws and principles that have been verified by the long river of time are the handy weapons for designers to overcome obstacles in the new era. </p>

    <title>How Do Socially-Inclined Korean Gamers Influence Game Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/04/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20230419_28584_1083880/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230419/28584_1083880.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game White Paper” released in January 2023 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Content Agency, in 2021, the global market share of Korean games reached 7.6%, second only to the United States, China, and Japan. It is the fourth largest game market in the world, with an annual consumption of 20.9913 trillion won (about 109.6 billion yuan). This figure is expected to reach 22.7 trillion won in 2022.</p>
<p>As a mainstream region for games to go overseas, many domestic companies are targeting the huge potential market of South Korea and launching localized game versions. In the localization process, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the characteristics of local players and make corresponding adjustments. Socially, players like in-game social interaction and also value communication in the game community. An in-depth understanding of the characteristics and needs of Korean game players can provide more targeted help for game localization.</p>
<h2 id="1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games"><a href="#1-Social-Characteristics-of-Korean-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games"></a>1. Social Characteristics of Korean Games</h2><p>Many players like to socialize in games, and Korean games also take advantage of this, encouraging players to cooperate or compete with other players. They generally provide a variety of social functions in the game, such as chat rooms, teams, and guilds, and support players to share game experiences in the game community to meet players’ social needs. This not only enriches the game content, but also promotes communication between players, and is an important means to improve player stickiness and loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Methods"><a href="#Social-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Social Methods"></a>Social Methods</h3><p>Many players regard games as a way of socializing, maintaining friendships and making new friends through games, expanding their social circle.</p>
<p>For many Korean players, games can be a way of socializing. Newzoo’s 2022 Korean player report shows that the biggest reason Korean players play games is for social interaction (18%). Playing games with friends can both kill time and enhance relationships. Therefore, most Korean games also incorporate social elements. For example, some games integrate the communication function of the social chat software Kakao, which can contact and add Kakao friends, and provide exclusive emoticon stickers for Kakao users, which is a relatively effective social marketing strategy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F4e5d19c9-8faf-4e80-b0b5-72992d64de48.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to the “2022 Korea Game Player Status Survey Report” (hereinafter referred to as the player survey), among PC game players, in addition to “relieving stress” and “killing time”, 30.2% of players choose “playing games with friends and family”. This ratio is higher among young players, and also shows that players in their 10s to 30s pay more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F805c7d37-fea7-4343-bf56-a1cbed438fbb.png/size/"></p>
<p>However, this ratio is only 13.4% among mobile game players. However, in addition to the convenience of mobile phones and the fun of the game itself, the second most important element for mobile game players is social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F1eab54c8-7e90-41aa-8e90-0b1494355dad.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, for mobile game players, 28.5% of players will use direct recommendations from friends as a reference for downloading new games, which is as important as the app store (Google Play, App Store, One Store) ranking reference. It can be seen that friends’ recommendations are an important factor that cannot be ignored. Playing the social element card well is also conducive to the game gaining more new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Ffda97707-70b0-44f8-a29c-c5bd5ac2acf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Korean PC bangs (internet cafes) are also an important part of their game industry, and the social nature of Korean PC bang players is particularly significant. According to a player survey, 57.3% of people who go to PC bangs to play games do so to play games with friends&#x2F;colleagues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fe784115b-d3e0-4ae0-b7cc-329fe07cb6a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, in the post-epidemic era, the trend of game social interaction has been reflected in players around the world. A study by Ipsos in conjunction with “Google for Games”, &lt;2022 The Shifting Needs of Global Mobile Gamers&gt;, shows that many players build connections with others through mobile games. Although people have gradually resumed offline social activities after the epidemic, online social habits have remained, and more and more players tend to communicate with others in games, replacing some offline social interactions. Sometimes, friends in the game even feel closer than acquaintances in life. Especially for Korean players, the game motivation of “having a common topic with others”, which is related to social purposes, has become stronger in the past year. It can be seen that players are paying more and more attention to the social attributes of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb645e70f-cf63-4f54-8071-497c9abb328a.png/size/"></p>
<p>In Newzoo’s research on game driving forces, it was found that the reasons for Chinese players’ gaming behavior are also relatively obvious. Games involving competition, exploration, and strategy are more directly attractive to players, while social purposes are lower than these factors. Another Newzoo survey of Japanese players shows that the three main motivations for Japanese players to play games are “relaxation and stress relief” (50%), “filling free time” (49%), and “exploring the game storyline” (45%). Only 13% of players play for social reasons (global average 25%), and only 11% play for the sense of competition and the joy of victory. It can be seen that emphasis on competitiveness and social interaction is more obvious in Korean players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb3a07c89-fb25-47cc-9a12-a8967d24ffe4.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fbad82401-206a-465f-af06-0f5565257bd2.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Game-Communities"><a href="#Game-Communities" class="headerlink" title="Game Communities"></a>Game Communities</h3><p>Secondly, the development of game communities has also become a favorable booster for player communication, including game forums, offline activities, and other forms. Korean game communities have developed rapidly, providing players with game-related information, functional, and interactive services. In South Korea, the local game unofficial communities with a relatively large number of users include DCinside, inven, and ruliweb. In the April popular community ranking, two pure game communities (inven, ruliweb) occupied the top five. The top-ranked comprehensive community, DCinside, also has a dedicated game section. These communities provide players with a more free discussion space, where they can find game content that players are more concerned about, and problems encountered by players, which helps to follow up on player feedback and public opinion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F06dbfe41-b734-4305-ba3f-3bfa0e687513.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, as a high-quality martial arts battle royale game, requires team cooperation and communication. <em>Naraka</em>’s Korean players have spontaneously established game groups on Discord, DC, and Kakao, sharing game-related information, sharing operations, displaying drawn skins and character customization data, discussing update information, helping other players solve various problems encountered during the game, and also looking for teammates to form teams, and even participating in competitions together. These forums or communities provide a platform for players to communicate, discuss the latest event plans, observe the operations of experts, find teammates to play together, and extend the feelings in the game to outside the game. A good community atmosphere is also conducive to attracting players and improving player retention.</p>
<p>At the same time, the community is also a window for game developers to communicate with players. Games that listen carefully to player feedback in forums, respect player opinions, and make timely improvements can also gain player recognition. For example, Smilegate’s MMORPG <em>LOST ARK</em> received many negative reviews on image quality, automatic combat, balance, etc. when it was first launched, but the development team promised players that it would make improvements, and after the update, it solved more than 90% of the problems and removed the content that players did not like. After the Season 2 update, the game’s daily visits increased by 122%, new players increased by 542%, and returning players increased by 213%. The development team even received support advertisements from players. Players highly praised Smilegate’s effective communication and active community operation.</p>
<h3 id="Esports-Culture"><a href="#Esports-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Esports Culture"></a>Esports Culture</h3><p>Third, the booming esports culture in South Korea is also an important part of its game social interaction. Many players pay attention to esports events and enjoy the social experience brought by the game by participating, watching, and commenting on esports events.</p>
<p>South Korea has played a significant role in promoting the development of esports. In 1998, <em>StarCraft</em> changed the landscape of the Korean game industry. Under the influence of the Asian financial crisis, the esports industry attracted the attention of capital and ushered in huge development. The concept of professional players was born. After the financial crisis, the Korean esports industry also received government support. Now, Korean esports has formed a relatively mature industrial model and is also an important part of Korean game culture. Esports competitions are very popular in South Korea and have a large audience. Korean players’ love and attention to esports are also very high. Esports activities are both competition events and social activities. Players watch esports live broadcasts, comment and communicate, reflecting Korean players’ enthusiasm for game competition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fd4a652fa-7559-4600-995d-a53453d1cba3.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Localization-Suggestions"><a href="#2-Localization-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Suggestions"></a>2. Localization Suggestions</h2><p>It can be seen that the Korean game market has huge potential and is also one of the important landing points for games to go overseas. Therefore, when launching games overseas, it is also necessary to fully understand the characteristics and preferences of local players, and deeply customize them during research and development, localization, and continuous operation, so that they can be welcomed by more players in the local market.</p>
<h3 id="Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game"><a href="#Community-Operation-Outside-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Community Operation Outside the Game"></a>Community Operation Outside the Game</h3><p>First, it is necessary to pay attention to community operation, focus on community building and interaction, and encourage players to share game experiences and insights.</p>
<p>Korean game communities have diverse forms and rich content, and different types of communities have a wide range of influence among Korean game players. Players share game guides and exchange game experiences in game forums, which can not only improve their game skills, but also promote interaction and social interaction between game players. By holding various activities such as competitions and lucky draws, mobilizing players’ enthusiasm can not only enhance players’ feelings, but also deepen the connection between players and the game.</p>
<h3 id="In-Game-Social-Gameplay"><a href="#In-Game-Social-Gameplay" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Social Gameplay"></a>In-Game Social Gameplay</h3><p>Secondly, the gameplay should also consider the social needs and habits of Korean players. <em>StarCraft</em> set off a wave of Korean game competition in the last century, driving the development of PC bangs and allowing players to experience the joy of competition in the game. Nowadays, the RTS, FPS, and MMORPG games that Korean players love also pay attention to the social needs of players. Strengthening players’ sense of belonging to guilds and teams, developing interesting multiplayer gameplay and team gameplay, convenient chat and friend systems, friend trading, reasonable ranking and achievement systems, etc., will give players a better experience.</p>
<p>In-depth research on Korean players before release and during continuous operation will help accurately capture the differences in social needs of different player groups and help the game better establish a player social network in South Korea. In the game, communicating, exploring, and cooperating with partners to complete difficult tasks and win over other opponents, so that high-quality games can build a bridge for players’ friendship, may also be an important meaning of the game itself.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players in various countries have user characteristics that cannot be ignored. To do a good job in localization, it is also necessary to have a deeper understanding of players, grasp player needs, and provide corresponding services according to the game in order to better retain players and achieve common growth. Games are an important part of Korean players’ social lives. Players value in-game social interaction, friend communication, actively participate in game communities, and enjoy the fun of esports. In the process of localization, you can start from two aspects: in-game social interaction and out-of-game social marketing. Develop convenient friend and guild systems in the game, actively maintain the community outside the game, improve player stickiness, consider players’ social needs, and formulate strategies that are consistent with the characteristics of the game itself while taking into account players’ social habits.</p>
<p>Of course, the most core competitiveness is undoubtedly relying on high-quality content, including the core of key gameplay and the appearance of exquisite art. On this basis, targeted adjustments made for local players can be the icing on the cake.</p>

    <title>Naraka Bladepoint Japanese Community Research - Focusing on 5chan</title>
    <url>/2023/04/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20230419_28584_1083882/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230419/28584_1083882.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the spread and rise of video games in modern society, the term “game community” related to video games has gradually entered the public eye. In today’s increasingly globalized world, the overseas expansion of games has become an indispensable part of the development of the game industry. Therefore, investigating the “game communities” of players in target regions, and subsequently formulating appropriate strategies for game distribution and subsequent operations, has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>The “game community” is a subset of the concept of “virtual community”. “Virtual community” was first proposed by Howard Rheingold, meaning “a group of people who primarily communicate with each other through computer networks, who have a certain degree of shared cognition, share knowledge and information, and care for each other to a large extent as friends, thus forming a group”. Unlike the traditional concept of community, “virtual community” originates from computers, is built in the virtual world, and develops on the Internet. The “game community” derived from the concept of “virtual community” refers to a group that spontaneously gathers on the Internet around the common interest of games.</p>
<p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> Japanese community in this article is a group of Japanese players who have spontaneously gathered around the game. Due to the diversity of network platforms, game communities also have various forms of expression. In Japan, mainstream game communities include Twitter, 5channel (also known as 2channel, hereinafter referred to as 5ch), Lobi, and so on. Because each platform has its own characteristics and functions, the game communities formed by players will also show different characteristics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fb1caa3e1-54a1-4d0a-baa9-a51a0a85930d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan"><a href="#1-User-Characteristics-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="1. User Characteristics of 5chan"></a>1. User Characteristics of 5chan</h2><p>When accessing the Japanese Internet, especially cultural and community activities, 5chan and its user base are impossible to ignore. 5chan, formerly known as “2channel” (2ch.net, hereinafter referred to as 2ch), was founded by Hiroyuki Nishimura in 1999 and is Japan’s largest anonymous forum (now no longer completely anonymous). Its initial purpose was to serve as an alternative website to “Amezou Bulletin Board”. Amezou Bulletin Board was a comprehensive forum that aggregated multiple posts, and adopted the then-epoch-making “thread float type bulletin board” format (posts that received replies would be pushed to the top of the thread, while posts that did not receive replies would sink relatively, and posts with no response at all would sink to the bottom).</p>
<p>Later, Amezou Bulletin Board was closed in 2000 due to lack of functionality, server instability, and other reasons, and a large number of users poured into 2ch. In 2014, the actual management authority of 2ch (2ch.net) was transferred to James Arthur Watkins, Hiroyuki Nishimura was dismissed, and “2channel” (2ch.sc) was established. In 2017, “2channel” owned by James Arthur Watkins was renamed “5channel” (5ch.net).</p>
<p>5chan, which was opened in 1999, absorbed the habits of previous forums in terms of users, content, and forum terminology. The communication method of avoiding collusion among users and using unique jargon (later called 2ch terminology) was strongly influenced by electronic forums in the dawn of the Internet, namely the “dark web”.</p>
<p>In addition to the particularity of communication, 5chan also contains many opinions and information that cannot be seen in newspapers, television, or well-known media, and shows a critical attitude towards specific media such as <em>Asahi Shimbun</em>. Many people believe that “if I have to say, there is more negative information on 2ch. Because it is a vent for the negative personality of human beings, it is reasonable to degenerate into a garbage dump”.</p>
<p>In Tomohisa Hirai’s “Investigation of 2ch Communication: Discussion on the Internet and its Public Opinion Formation”, he summarizes the users of 2ch into the following 3 characteristics:</p>
<h3 id="Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints"><a href="#Desire-for-Self-Expression-Breaking-Free-from-Social-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints"></a>Desire for Self-Expression: Breaking Free from Social Constraints</h3><p>Compared with face-to-face communication, Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) gives communicators (the actors themselves) more room for deliberation and choice. In face-to-face communication, communicators can express themselves through speech, body movements, clothing, etc., but it is difficult to manipulate self-expression related to physical characteristics such as gender, race, and age. In most cases, communicators themselves will also suppress self-expression behaviors that deviate from the unified values or behavioral norms of society. Communicators in CMC will be in a situation that is more free relative to norms. In addition, the “anonymity” and “ease of participation and withdrawal” that form and maintain the communication environment in which communicators are located also have a certain impact in CMC.</p>
<p>Personal communication on the Internet is a liberation from social constraints, and 2ch provides an environment of “anonymity” and “availability to join and leave at any time”. Because 2ch guarantees that users can be liberated from social restrictions, users can carry out communication that is rarely expressed in daily life. Some players may indeed feel dissatisfied with certain aspects of a game, but it is not appropriate to complain about it in the game’s social network or discuss its negative factors in depth. Some players will express their opinions on anonymous platforms with relatively few restrictions, thereby achieving self-expression.</p>
<h3 id="Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model"><a href="#Anonymous-Communication-Refer-to-the-SIDE-Model" class="headerlink" title="Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model"></a>Anonymous Communication: Refer to the SIDE Model</h3><p>Research related to the SIDE model is based on the hypothesis that “the lack of personal cues will make participants have a higher sense of group in their personal identity and mutual behavior, and increase their trust in the group and related rules”, with the purpose of investigating “anonymous CMC situations”. The method is to observe the group set in the laboratory. The observation results can be summarized as “in the case of anonymous communication with clear group characteristics, participants are often forced to be depersonalized. The result is that personal consciousness is lower than the consciousness as a group member. From the perspective of enhancing group member consciousness, two views can be derived: ① If the “group member” consciousness is higher than the “personal consciousness”, participants tend to obey situational norms. ② When participants are aware of their group identity, they tend to favor the internal group, discriminate against the external group, and have higher hostility towards the external group. And these characteristics can be found in 2ch.</p>
<h3 id="Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s"><a href="#Formation-of-Internal-Groups-and-Social-Background-Refer-to-the-Communication-of-Young-People-after-the-1990s" class="headerlink" title="Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s"></a>Formation of Internal Groups and Social Background: Refer to the Communication of Young People after the 1990s</h3><p>In the communication of young people after the 1990s, one effective view is “valuing relationship”. In other words, compared to conveying content, communicators pay more attention to the communication itself with others, that is, “communication for the sake of communication”. In the view of sociology, young people after 1995 have little resonance with the value system of mass media, but value the relationship with friends who are close to them. Similarly, although young people are more sensitive to the nature of their relationships with friends, they often enjoy this relationship. Young people are more concerned about intimate relationships, but more indifferent to the outside of intimate relationships.</p>
<p>In summary, the overall user profile of 5chan can be summarized as: young people who gather together due to the same interest, have a desire for self-expression, value internal relationships, have exclusionary psychology towards external groups, have stronger cohesion within the forum, and are more active in communication.</p>
<h2 id="2-Functional-Features-of-5chan"><a href="#2-Functional-Features-of-5chan" class="headerlink" title="2. Functional Features of 5chan"></a>2. Functional Features of 5chan</h2><p>When studying the potential game community of 2ch, it is necessary to not only focus on the user characteristics of the entire 2ch forum, but also combine the functional characteristics of the 2ch forum itself.</p>
<p>Currently, 5chan has 39 main boards, and the main boards are further divided into sub-boards. Among them, there are three main boards related to games, namely games, mobile games, and online games. Under the main board, the platform will make a more detailed classification of games according to the type of game. The game board covers a wider range of games and contains more sub-boards. Users can click on the corresponding sub-board to enter the section after judging according to the type of game they want to browse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F87629d4e-2e96-4bfd-b5ca-a63b951486fc.png/size/"></p>
<p>After entering a sub-board, you can first see the content and theme discussed in the board. In order to prevent users from going to the wrong board and posting in the wrong place, links to connected or easily confused boards will be marked.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> belongs to the PC Action (PC action game) section, and the content discussed is all FPS, TPS, and action games running on Windows and other computers. Please go to other sections for other types of games, such as adult-oriented Galgames, online games, etc. Like Baidu Tieba, the board rules and posting rules are located at the top for new users to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do not reply to any troublemaking, inciting, prohibited topics, hit-and-run, or useless posts &gt;(repliers are also regarded as troublemakers)]</p>
<p>[Please confirm before posting]</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a public place. Please do not create useless posts unrelated to PC action games.</li>
<li>Please confirm that you have not posted in the wrong section.</li>
<li>Please search the [Post Overview] again to confirm that no one has posted duplicate or similar posts.</li>
<li>Series works should be posted in a unified post. Niche games should be based on the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crimes, illegal copying, software exchange, emulators, pornography, yellow jokes, attacks on fixed nicknames and individual players, and repeaters are prohibited. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F441c6f4c-26c0-4a26-a4f6-e275de8d9003.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F3ec9c3a9-5a9e-43df-a650-caedb3716dd5.png/size/"></p>
<p>This ensures that users who enter a certain post are first of all interested in the field where the post is located or have already understood it, and can communicate with people who have the same interest, and the speeches in the communication process follow the same forum rules and themes. Secondly, due to the secrecy of the retrieval system and the anonymity of users, 5chan is distinguished from some popular social media such as Twitter and completely open communication communities such as Discord.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the characteristics of the forum, the content of users’ speeches on 5chan will also be different from other communities. As mentioned above, the exclusionary psychology of 5chan users is reflected in the rules of the forum. They often prohibit new players from directly posting duplicate content without reading previous posts, or posting some content that is not worth posting separately. We believe that the rules that new users first read after entering 5chan will give them a feeling of entering an internal group from the public world, which will make them naturally abide by the rules of the internal group, otherwise they will be expelled by the internal group. The process of browsing the post history is not only a process of learning the rules of the internal group, but also a process of gradually recognizing their identity as an internal member.</p>
<p>In addition to the characteristics of user speeches, when searching for information on social media such as Twitter, it is usually a direct search or following some related tweeters. This will make users browse more than communicate even if they are interested in a certain field on social media. Even if they tweet to ask some content, they may not be answered. The unique Japanese habit of “FF-gai kara shitsurei shimasu” (I’m sorry to comment without following you or being followed by you) will also make the communication lengthy and complicated, and whether or not to follow will get a lot of redundant information that they don’t want. However, in a separate post of a certain game on 5chan, the desire for communication among members who belong to this internal group is greater than their desire for browsing, and the various conveniences of the forum also ensure that members can speak and discuss freely under the constraints of regulations. Therefore, the communication of users on the forum is more prosperous, and the feedback on the game will be directly posted on the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2Fed92bc22-2dd7-4ba1-9bc0-cecb8657c3df.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan"><a href="#3-Naraka-Bladepoint-in-5chan" class="headerlink" title="3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan"></a>3. Naraka: Bladepoint in 5chan</h2><p>The <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> thread in 5chan was created on November 12, 2020 during the game’s internal test, which triggered players’ discussions about the initial hero strength. Since the game had not yet been released, the thread also became inactive. In April 2021, the game was tested again, and because it was possible to directly experience the game, the discussion about the game in the thread was also more active. Players’ discussions during the game test can directly reflect the players’ real views on the game, guiding the development team to further improve the content of the game.</p>
<p>After the game was officially released, the discussion of the game was directly focused on the essence of the game - gameplay. In Japan, the solo mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is classified as a fighting game, and the release method of the character’s ultimate, the strength of the character, and the combos of various weapons have been discussed. For the parts other than the gameplay itself, the battle pass, and the face customization function, which is one of the hot spots of the game, can only be said to be rarely discussed. In addition to the discussion focused on the gameplay itself and the exchange and discussion of game techniques, unlike other communities, this is not a platform for making friends, so there is no pure personal showing off and unprovoked insults to other players, and due to the high degree of participation and cohesion, the questions raised by players can also be answered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230419%2F7823b4fb-e281-4c22-a4fa-b206b802edf0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Compared with other social media, such as Twitter and Weibo, the visible range of content posted is filtered, requiring keyword searches or following someone, and the lack of anonymity and other functions also leads to users being unlikely to get interaction. Even if they can participate in the discussion in real time, it is difficult to form a discussion atmosphere where many people express their opinions on the same issue. In addition, due to visibility, word count limits, and disagreement with others, negative impressions posted on open large-scale social media may also cause disgust and lead to disputes. In contrast, 5chan first filters the participants in the discussion - players who have a certain understanding of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. Secondly, the anonymity, functions, and its own cohesive characteristics of the forum make the discussion here more active and real, showing the players’ gaming experience, rather than meaningless complaints, spam, or recruitment information.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When understanding overseas game trends through research and capture of game communities, and then feeding back to game development, it is first necessary to understand the composition and characteristics of overseas communities in the target country. On the basis of further understanding user needs, apply them to the improvement of the game. The communities of each country will show different characteristics in their own culture and the evolution of Internet history, which is also a part worth paying attention to. How to use the characteristics reflected in the communities of each country to promote the game is also a topic that needs to be considered when expanding influence through communities.</p>

    <title>Why Do Players Turn a Blind Eye? Novice Guide Design from the Perspective of Selective Attention</title>
    <url>/2023/03/31/netease-ux-articles/news_20230424_28584_1084761/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230424/28584_1084761.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In game research, we found a common phenomenon: when players experience new games or new gameplays, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play; on the other hand, the developers feel very confused. There is obviously a long introduction to the gameplay in the game, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Some veteran players also feel that new players are particularly “blind and unskilled” when they team up with new players to play dungeons. Even if the information is obvious, the novice will say that they did not see it.</p>
<p>So, how does this “blindness” of players come about? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it?</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”"><a href="#1-How-Common-is-“Not-Seeing”" class="headerlink" title="1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?"></a>1. How Common is “Not Seeing”?</h2><p>When players are doing novice training, they need to go through the following steps to finally master the gameplay: I see the guide, I know I need to do this, I do it, I learn it. And if any of these steps are missing, it will cause the player to fail to learn.</p>
<p>In the initial research expectation, we believed that players getting stuck in the novice stage might be more difficult in “completing the guide”, that is, the task settings need to be adjusted. However, subsequent eye-tracking tests showed that more players were stuck in the first two steps, that is, the players did not see the guide at all, and this was not because the players were unwilling to read the novice guide. In the test, even if players were required not to skip the guide and to follow the guide prompts, they would still miss a lot of information.</p>
<p>Psychological research also confirms that this “invisibility” of players is not only common, but also innate, and is related to the selective attention mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See"><a href="#2-Why-Can’t-Players-“See”-The-Characteristics-of-Attention-Determine-That-People-Only-See-What-They-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See"></a>2. Why Can’t Players “See”? The Characteristics of Attention Determine That People Only See What They Want to See</h2><p>If the human brain is a TV set, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. Only the TV programs that finally appear on the screen can be noticed by us. Although in many cases people can consciously choose which programs to watch, in many cases, this choice is subconscious. Among them, those that do not require will effort and that people can naturally pay attention to are called involuntary attention. For example, it is difficult not to hear the ringing of a mobile phone in a quiet meeting room; a red flower in a green lawn will be more conspicuous than a green flower. The act of paying attention that requires will effort and needs to be actively made is called voluntary attention, such as reviewing homework before an exam, learning some useful but boring new knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>It is theorized that involuntary attention is a subconscious response and does not occupy psychological resources; but voluntary attention requires the player’s resources. Therefore, when receiving multiple external information, due to limited cognitive resources, players will selectively pay attention, that is, only see what they want to see and the most important information, while ignoring other information.</p>
<p>In the game, if the player cannot see the guide, it means that the current guide is likely to occupy too many resources, causing the player to spend too much effort to play the game. If you want the novice of the game to be noticed by the player, you need to manage the player’s attention and try to attract the player’s involuntary attention.</p>

What Kind of Information is Easier to be Seen: Information That is Different and Information That Matches Your Interests</h2><p>So, how to attract the player’s involuntary attention and let the player see it effortlessly? The reasons for attracting involuntary attention can be summarized into two categories:</p>
<h3 id="The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated"><a href="#The-characteristics-of-the-information-itself-are-different-and-differentiated" class="headerlink" title="The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated."></a>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated.</h3><p>For example, it can be something unusual happening suddenly in the game, or it can be a significant difference from the surrounding game scene.</p>
<p>For example, when the game needs to guide the player to perform a dodge operation, there are generally prompts in the form of guide text or screen special effects. If the screen color or brightness changes significantly when the boss releases a skill, for example, a bright red circle appears in the skill range, the player will be able to pay attention to it at once without additional effort; but if there is only a change in the content of the guide text on the screen, the player is likely to not see it. Because the guide task prompts in the game are generally fixed on the left side of the screen, when the guide continues to appear in this state, in the player’s view, this area lacks change and lacks distinction from the surrounding scene, so it will be instinctively ignored.</p>
<h3 id="The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs"><a href="#The-information-matches-the-person’s-own-state-interests-and-needs" class="headerlink" title="The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs."></a>The information matches the person’s own state, interests, and needs.</h3><p>In other words, the more the information matches the player’s interests, the more attention it can attract.</p>
<p>For example, when a new player encounters a new type of game for the first time, he will have some questions in his mind and expect a novice tutorial to guide his operation. At this time, the guide that pops up will be more easily noticed; and when a veteran player is playing the game, he has no expectations or related needs for guidance, so he often operates before consciousness and is more likely to not see the relevant guidance in the game.</p>
<h2 id="4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design"><a href="#4-How-Can-Selective-Attention-and-Involuntary-Attention-Guide-Novice-Design" class="headerlink" title="4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?"></a>4. How Can Selective Attention and Involuntary Attention Guide Novice Design?</h2><p>How can the above characteristics related to attention guide the novice design of the game? Here are just a few interesting examples.</p>
<h3 id="Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance"><a href="#Which-form-is-better-for-novice-guidance" class="headerlink" title="Which form is better for novice guidance?"></a>Which form is better for novice guidance?</h3><p>Common novice guides are presented in text, pictures, and videos. According to our life experience, we will think that words are not as good as pictures, and pictures are not as good as videos. Some studies have also confirmed that paying attention to pictures can improve learning effects more than paying attention to text. But other studies have shown that it is not absolute that pictures are better than text, and the contrast effect needs to be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 1: Look at words when there are many pictures, and look at pictures when there are many words, highlighting the differences.</strong></p>
<p>When we observe real-world scenes, our attention is always attracted by the text embedded in these scenes, for example, text on signs or billboards. A study of travel photos found that people look more at the text in the pictures, and no matter what the text content is, they will pay attention to the text. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F2f60333d-14ad-4dbb-8e4c-40288171235d.png/size/" alt="A photo, as described in the article."></p>
<p>When we conducted eye-tracking tests on <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we also unexpectedly found that for the text and picture guides presented simultaneously in the game, the player’s gaze duration on the text was significantly longer than that on the pictures. In other words, people are always more likely to pay attention to information that is different. Whether the game chooses text guidance or picture guidance needs to be determined according to the characteristics of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F5812121f-25e2-4249-8f45-68aba68b7923.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Novice Guide Player Eye-tracking Heat Map</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But once the research scene is changed to a text-based webpage, the situation changes. Eye-tracking data shows that the pictures in the text pile are more eye-catching. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff1dc0888-a6a9-4ec4-abc4-a2db13f4a967.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Eye-tracking heat map for a webpage, the subject’s gaze is concentrated on the picture</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Contrast Effect 2: Less is more, the more white space, the easier it is to be seen</strong></p>
<p>When there is too little white space between the logo and the main title, people will spend more time looking at the logo instead of the main title. And when the distance between the logo and the main title is increased, people’s attention to the title will increase. When two buttons are too close, they will also compete for attention. After changing to only one option, people’s visual attention increases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F7c2b20ea-0f3e-41c8-9ddb-e7ccf17e8b46.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>After the spacing is changed, the subject’s attention to the title increases</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In games, in order not to compete for attention, you can increase the white space between important prompts and buttons, and at the same time avoid dense presentation of important information in a paragraph of text.</p>
<h3 id="In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention"><a href="#In-addition-to-bombarding-the-vision-how-else-can-novice-guidance-guide-attention" class="headerlink" title="In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?"></a>In addition to bombarding the vision, how else can novice guidance guide attention?</h3><p>For the common problem that players cannot understand the guidance, developers easily want to “write more detailed guidance information” to help players understand. But the contrast effect has pointed out that dense text will cause players’ attention to be scattered, and to highlight the key points, more attention needs to be paid to white space. So, what else can be done?</p>
<p><strong>Multichannel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation</strong></p>
<p>Compared with players who only pay attention to vision or hearing, players who pay attention to both the visual and auditory channels process information faster and more accurately. Auditory information can attract the player’s visual attention to the direction pointed to by the auditory signal, and improve the efficiency of subsequent information processing.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, when players are near a Mongolian camp, they may hear singing, drumming, and playing the morin khuur; they may also hear the playing of the pipa, and players can follow the sound to find the storyteller, thus being led to new tasks. Foxes are another example. Their short, sharp calls manage the player’s attention early on, making it difficult for the player to miss the guidance and ultimately leading the player to the shrine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F38d7d80f-5dbe-4e98-8a72-0eeea8344ac4.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster"><a href="#Line-guidance-Any-form-of-cue-can-guide-the-player-to-focus-on-the-key-points-faster" class="headerlink" title="Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster"></a>Line guidance: Any form of cue can guide the player to focus on the key points faster</h3><p><strong>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text, the better the learning</strong></p>
<p>The position of pictures and text will also affect people’s attention to learning materials. The closer the pictures and text, the longer the gaze duration, the more gaze times, and the better the memory of the knowledge points afterwards; and when the pictures and text are close, people’s gaze point switching between the pictures and text is more frequent. This means that the proximity effect affects people’s attention allocation, thereby improving the learning effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3f3acdd7-31ea-406b-b1a1-a8070e0e8b4f.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>“The formation principle of lightning” as learning material, the right picture is the picture-text proximity group, the learning effect is better</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points</strong></p>
<p>Designers always want to use visual cues to try to guide users’ browsing direction on a webpage, so are some visual cues more effective than others? Some studies have tried different forms such as hand-drawn arrows, character photos (looking at the table &amp; facing away from the table), line prompts, and adding border outlines. The final result shows that visual cues do affect users’ attention to the form, with hand-drawn arrows leading to the most user attention to the form. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa0a63665-6040-41a9-ade4-5425d86195e9.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>The player’s turning a blind eye is more related to the selective attention mechanism, and the characteristics of attention determine that people will only see what they want to see. Game design should pay attention to the player’s attention management, try to attract the player’s involuntary attention, rather than forcing indoctrination. For example, you can consider making the information more different and making the information more in line with the player’s current interests. Specifically in the design, the contrast effect, proximity effect, multichannel presentation, line guidance, etc. can all be used as design guidelines.</p>

    <title>ChatGPT Evaluation Is It a Good Translation Tool</title>
    <url>/2023/03/30/netease-ux-articles/news_20230424_28584_1084772/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230424/28584_1084772.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has made continuous progress, and its application scenarios have continued to expand and deepen. AIGC, or AI-generated content, has broken through the public’s cognitive and imaginative boundaries of AI technology. With its outstanding capabilities in content creation such as voice, text, images, videos, and others, it may pose a huge challenge to a large number of practitioners in various industries, such as artists, engineers, and designers, and the era of change it triggers is obvious.</p>
<p>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a natural language processing tool driven by artificial intelligence technology, a specific application and product of AIGC. It can understand and learn human language to conduct conversations, interact based on the context of the chat, really chat and communicate like humans, and even complete tasks such as writing emails, video scripts, copywriting, translation, code, and writing papers.</p>
<p>For the gaming industry, possible application scenarios of AIGC include: AI drawing, AI dubbing, copywriting planning, faster collection of materials and information, operations can use templates for writing, and programmers can use it to write and debug computer programs.</p>
<p>So, for localization services, can ChatGPT’s translation function be implemented in practical application scenarios? This article will select <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> translated text of different styles, use the translation results of human translators as the standard, and use BLEU scoring and manual evaluation to compare the translation results of Deepl and ChatGPT, two machine translation tools, in order to obtain a preliminary conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="1-Test-Preparation"><a href="#1-Test-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="1. Test Preparation"></a>1. Test Preparation</h2><p>First, we made a series of preparations before the test, and determined the selection of tools, data, standards, and other dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ChatGPT version:</strong> 3.5</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation data:</strong> 4 sets of representative texts were selected from the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> translation library as evaluation data</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Machine translation tool:</strong> Deepl</p>
<p>The reason for choosing Deepl is that it performs relatively more accurately in terms of translation quality, especially in the translation of words and phrases. Relatively speaking, Google Translate is suitable for general translation tasks, such as daily expressions, simple business communication, etc., but the translation quality is relatively average. Deepl is suitable for more professional translation tasks, such as translating technical documents, academic papers, etc., or occasions that require higher translation quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Test languages:</strong> Chinese, English, Spanish</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation standard:</strong> BLEU score</p>
<p>BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is used to evaluate the correspondence between machine translation and professional human translation. The core idea is that the closer the machine translation is to professional human translation, the better the quality. BLEU is the oldest, most commonly used, and most classic indicator in the field of machine translation. Most machine translation papers even use only this one indicator as the evaluation standard of the system, and its importance is obvious.</p>
<p>Although BLEU scoring is a widely used automatic evaluation method, it also has some shortcomings: it cannot consider semantic and contextual information, it is sensitive to the number of standard reference texts, it can only be based on n-gram matching, and it cannot handle rare words. Therefore, it needs to be combined with other evaluation methods for comprehensive evaluation to accurately assess translation quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Test-Method"><a href="#2-Test-Method" class="headerlink" title="2. Test Method"></a>2. Test Method</h2><p>This article selects four different types of existing translations of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, including skill descriptions, background stories, action descriptions, and literary classical style. In order to compare the translation effects of Deepl and ChatGPT, we use them to perform “Chinese-English”, “Chinese-Spanish”, and “English-Spanish” operations respectively. At the same time, we use the translation results of human translators as the standard and use BLEU to score the above translations. By comparing the BLEU scores of various translations, we can evaluate the performance of Deepl and ChatGPT in terms of translation quality and provide a basis for subsequent analysis.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Similarity to Human Translation</strong></p>
<p>In terms of absolute score, the BLEU score can indicate the quality of machine translation. The higher the score, the higher the degree of matching between the machine translation result and the reference translation, and the better the quality of the machine translation. Generally speaking, a score higher than 40 can be considered a good machine translation result. In our evaluation results, only one score of Deepl and ChatGPT each exceeded 40. This shows that at this stage, the similarity between machine translation results and human translation results is low, and the practical effect is not good.</p>
<p>In terms of relative score, among the 12 BLEU scores, only 5 scores of ChatGPT are higher than Deepl, which shows that the similarity between ChatGPT translation and human translation is lower than that of Deepl.</p>
<p>In order to verify the reliability of this result, we checked the test results of other scholars. The BLEU evaluation results for 50 sentences showed that the average scores of Deepl and ChatGPT for Chinese-English translation were lower than 40, and the similarity between ChatGPT translation and human translation was lower than that of Deepl.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>English to Spanish is Better Than Chinese to Spanish</strong></p>
<p>From a vertical perspective, whether it is Deepl or ChatGPT, the scores of English-Spanish are higher than those of Chinese-Spanish. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of the size of the corpus, the translations of Deepl and ChatGPT are based on their respective Internet corpora, and it is obvious that the corpus of English-Spanish is richer than that of Chinese-Spanish. It is estimated that the number of English-Spanish corpora currently used for machine translation has reached millions to tens of millions; while the number of corpora translated from Chinese to Spanish is only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Because of language similarity, Chinese and Spanish have low similarity. Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, and Spanish belongs to the Romance language family, with great differences in grammar and vocabulary; although English belongs to the Germanic language family and Spanish belongs to the Romance language family, both belong to the Indo-European language family, and there are many similarities in grammar and vocabulary; at the same time, compared with Asian culture, the cultural background differences between English and Spanish, which are both in the Western world, are small.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Human-Analysis"><a href="#Human-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Human Analysis"></a>Human Analysis</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>
<p>With a huge Internet corpus and clever grammar rule settings, the grammar of machine translation is almost always compliant. When translating long sentences, machine translation can skillfully use various adverbs and clauses to completely express the original text, presenting a good translation result.</p>
<p>However, there are some subtle deficiencies when subjective judgment is required. For example, in the English-Spanish translation of hero skills, English omits the subject of the whole paragraph when translating hero skills. When human translators deal with it, considering that it describes hero skills, they use the hero as the subject, while Deepl uses the player as the subject, and ChatGPT directly processes it into a sentence without a subject. In contrast, human translators are better when subjective judgment is required.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wording</strong></p>
<p>The performance of machine translation in terms of wording is average. For simple action descriptions and storytelling, machine translation can do the job. However, once it encounters words that need to be deeply understood, such as game terminology, idioms, cultural backgrounds, and mythological allusions, machine translation will face huge challenges and often fail to translate accurately, and may even make serious mistakes. This is because these words have complex meanings and cultural backgrounds, and need to be understood in conjunction with context and context, and machine translation is currently difficult to achieve complete human understanding.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game terminology</strong></p>
<p>“单双排” (dān shuāng pái) is a basic game term used to describe the mode in which players participate in the game. Human translators correctly translated it as “Solo and Duos”.</p>
<p>However, the machine translation performance was poor, and they were all processed as “single and double rows” (Deepl) and “single and double formations” (ChatGPT). This shows that there are still defects in machine translation in identifying and understanding game terminology.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Idioms and sayings</strong></p>
<p>“老当益壮” (lǎo dāng yì zhuàng) means that one is old, but his physical strength and spirit are stronger. The human translator did not translate it literally, but adopted the method of free translation, “move with the energy of a man half your age”.</p>
<p>Deepl’s processing is very direct, “old and strong”, simple and crude; ChatGPT is relatively smarter, “is aging like wine”, which means “get better over time”. Although it has been interpreted, it is not completely consistent with the meaning of praising physical strength and spirit. Moreover, it is not appropriate to use it in the context of “Shen Miao praising grandpa for being old and strong”.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mythological allusions</strong></p>
<p>“鱼化龙” (yú huà lóng) is an ancient Chinese legend that tells the story of an ordinary carp that finally succeeded in becoming a dragon through continuous efforts. Chinese players understand this word with almost no cultural barriers, but Western players basically do not have this cultural background. Therefore, in order to better convey the connotation of the allusion, the human translator translated it on the basis of a simple explanation, “Like the ancient fish of legend, growing legs and rising to become dragons”.</p>
<p>However, the machine translation simply translated it according to the literal meaning, “transform from a fish to a dragon” (Deepl), “rise like a dragon from a fish” (ChatGPT).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural background</strong></p>
<p>“神机营” (shén jī yíng) was one of the three major battalions of the capital’s forbidden army in the Ming Dynasty. It was a special force in the Ming Dynasty army that specialized in managing firearms. Therefore, when the human translator dealt with it, it was translated as “Firearms Division”.</p>
<p>Deepl translated it as “Divine Machine Camp”, and ChatGPT translated it as “Divine Machine Corps”. I wonder what foreign players think when they see the magical machine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Literariness</strong></p>
<p>When describing Ning Hongye’s bundled Pear Garden White Element, the planner quoted the Yue opera “The Legend of the White Snake” lyrics: “冲出峨嵋万重山，踏破云层往人间” (chōng chū é méi wàn chóng shān, tà pò yún céng wǎng rén jiān). It is Bai Suzhen’s monologue after she transformed into a human and walked out of Mount Emei. The main meaning of this lyric is that the white snake breaks through the barriers of the many peaks of Emei, treads through the clouds, and comes to the human world from the sky. This expresses that the white snake does not hesitate to venture out of the mountain to stay with Xu Xian, overcomes many obstacles, transforms into a human form and comes to the human world.</p>
<p>The translator’s translation is: “Lo, she bursts forth from the myriad peaks of Emei, Clouds treaded underfoot, down from heavens high in the sky.” The wording is gorgeous and poetic. “Lo” is used to express surprise or attention, and is more common in literary works or religious texts. “Bursts forth” is used to describe breaking through, which means breaking through obstacles and breaking through constraints, which is more vivid. “Myriad peaks” expresses the meaning of numerous and countless peaks, which is more gorgeous. “Clouds treaded underfoot” refers to stepping on clouds, which has a magical and romantic mood. “Down from heavens high in the sky” expresses the mysterious feeling of falling from the sky and being high above, which is more poetic.</p>
<p>Deepl’s translation is “Break out of Emei’s ten thousand mountains and step through the clouds to earth.” ChatGPT’s translation is “Breaking through the Emei Mountains, stepping through the clouds towards the mortal realm.” Although they can express the meaning of the original text, they use relatively straightforward expressions, lacking beauty and mysticism. Among them, “Break out of” and “Breaking through” are directly translated as “冲出” (chōng chū), lacking the details and beauty of the action; “万重山” (wàn chóng shān) is literally translated as “ten thousand mountains” by Deepl, while ChatGPT ignores the adjective “万重” (wàn chóng), thus losing the description of the towering mountains in the original text; “to earth” and “towards the mortal realm” Although it expresses the meaning of “往人间” (wǎng rén jiān), it lacks a certain sense of mysticism, making it impossible for readers to feel the emotions in the original text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>It will take time for machine translation to dominate.</p>
<p>At this stage, machine translations represented by Deepl and ChatGPT perform well in terms of grammar, but perform poorly when it comes to understanding game terminology, idioms, cultural backgrounds, and mythological allusions, or when literary interpretation is required.</p>
<p>Overall, the machine translation results are quite different from the human translation results. In practice, translators need to make major adjustments to the machine translation results to meet the requirements; the ideal working mode at present is still human-based and machine-assisted.</p>
<p>Using cooking as an analogy, the current level of machine translation is equivalent to preparing and matching some raw materials, waiting for the chef to cook, to make delicious dishes. The chef’s level has a greater impact on the final result.</p>
<p>Compared with machine translation tools such as Deepl, ChatGPT, as a model that can be continuously iterated and learned, may reach the level of fast food in the future, which can be eaten by simply heating, and has almost no requirements for human cooking skills. But as for how it tastes, it still needs time to test. But it is foreseeable that ChatGPT has a promising future!</p>

<h2 id="1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market"><a href="#1-Overview-of-the-German-Game-Market" class="headerlink" title="1. Overview of the German Game Market"></a>1. Overview of the German Game Market</h2><p>Germany is located in central Europe. It is the engine of Europe and also the largest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Data shows that Germany’s total GDP in 2022 was 27.38 trillion.</p>
<p>After setting a revenue record in 2020, the German game market also achieved explosive growth in 2021, with a total revenue (including hardware, games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases) of approximately 9.76 billion euros. Compared with 2012, it has more than tripled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F0577e133-b993-4283-8938-df10249a1715.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>As of 2021, German game market revenue (published on February 23, 2023)</em></p>
<p>The growing demand of German players for game-related hardware (especially consoles) is considered to be an important driving force for the booming German game market. Although some game consoles were in short supply due to the impact of the epidemic on the supply chain and logistics, the overall revenue of consoles also resisted the pressure and increased by 23%, reaching 808 million euros. Revenue from in-app purchases has also increased. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fe20c6691-9d75-4f14-8349-8446df2ae533.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>German hardware revenue achieved huge growth in 2021</em></p>
<p>It is worth noting that, in addition to areas strongly related to games, such as game copies and hardware, which have performed well, the market for game furniture and game accessories in Germany is also gradually taking the stage. According to a survey by the German Game Industry Association, nearly millions of players have purchased game-related furniture, and more than 11 million players plan to purchase game-related furniture, including gaming chairs, computer stands, controller stands, lamps, etc. Therefore, many well-known furniture manufacturers in Germany have also launched their game series furniture in order to occupy this huge market early. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F556d943f-5330-4021-9f2d-38fdfacceaca.png/size/"></p>
<p>From a platform perspective, according to statistics from the German Game Association, as of 2022, there are 23.5 million mobile game players in Germany. In addition, there are 10.7 million users who use tablets to play games. The number of mobile game users accounts for a relatively high proportion.</p>
<p>The demand of German players for consoles (such as Switch, PlayStation, Xbox) is also basically increasing year by year. It may be that the impact of the epidemic is getting smaller and smaller, and most Germans are no longer locked down at home, so the number of PC players has decreased slightly in comparison. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Ff8b65aab-f810-4ca3-9c34-19207216004c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base"><a href="#2-The-Consequences-of-an-Aging-Population-An-Aging-Player-Base" class="headerlink" title="2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base"></a>2. The Consequences of an Aging Population: An Aging Player Base</h2><p>According to the latest population statistics in 2022, Germany has a total population of 82.196 million. Its game penetration rate is nearly 60%, which means that 6 out of every 10 people have gaming experience, and the number of game players is approaching 50 million.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quality of German game users is also very high. Most German players believe that payment is a guarantee of game quality, and their willingness to pay is second only to the United States. Nearly 70% of players are willing to pay for games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F68d60fbd-52ef-4ecd-8411-5b87fafeadf5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><em>(Note: The data comes from a questionnaire survey conducted by Gamma Data (CNG) on mobile game user groups in the United States&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;France&#x2F;United Kingdom.)</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, according to data from the German Federal Statistical Office, except for the elderly group over 75 years old, the largest age group in Germany is 55-59 years old, accounting for 8.2% of the total population. The average age of the German population has reached 47 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F8f28d6d7-6457-40df-900c-d6057eef668c.png/size/"></p>
<p>The serious aging of the population has also increased the average age of game players. According to survey data from market research company GfK: The proportion of middle-aged and elderly players in Germany aged 50-59 reached 18%, which is the highest proportion of age groups. Many players in the 1980s and 1990s have maintained their hobby of playing video games to this day. At the same time, the average age of German game players is also increasing year by year: in 2020, the average age of players was 37.4 years old, and in 2021, it has reached 37.6 years old. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fa29b2c20-9ae4-44a6-aab9-949502d0ba86.png/size/"></p>
<p>Germany has a general trend of an aging society, so German residents are rigorous, relatively conservative, pay attention to order, and are less social. Nearly 80% of players will learn about product user reviews, overall ratings, and descriptions before downloading the game. At the same time, the relatively conservative characteristics are also subtly affecting the aesthetics of Germans. For example, Germans tend to wear darker clothes, and like to wear practical clothes such as jackets. At the same time, they are also conservative in the aesthetic style of games, and do not like overly chaotic and bright colors.</p>
<p>For example, in the evaluation of the appearance of female characters in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some German players gave positive comments because some female characters did not wear high heels, which is very practical in actual combat.</p>
<p>Therefore, grasping the above characteristics of German players can help game manufacturers to be more successful when going overseas to Germany. At the same time, these characteristics are also reflected in German players’ preferences for games.</p>
<h2 id="3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices"><a href="#3-German-Players’-Game-Preferences-and-Choices" class="headerlink" title="3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices"></a>3. German Players’ Game Preferences and Choices</h2><p>Rigorous and conservative Germans maintain their consistent habits in the choice of game genres: strategy games are especially popular. Surveys show that the 5 most popular game categories in Germany in 2022 are: strategy, action, action-adventure, adventure, and simulation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc8d90a2d-2444-4364-8533-e9f50e0dbbb6.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to data from Data.ai, among the games with the most downloads by German players, strategy games + match-3 games account for 70% of the list. The Top 10 of the list are basically casual puzzle games, which is also in line with the needs of middle-aged and elderly players for game choices: they don’t need to spend too much time, the gameplay is not particularly intense, and they can sit quietly on the sofa and use their brains. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fb235ef91-07af-453f-b561-e4318c0fc947.png/size/"></p>
<p>The loyalty of the German mobile game market is very high, which is not only reflected in the choice of games: <em>Coin Master</em>, which ranks first in mobile game revenue, was released 13 years ago, but it still occupies the top few positions in the German game list for many years. Classic match-3 games like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> have also been released for 9 years. Most of the games on the list are old games that have been released for more than two years. It can be seen that Germans are very dedicated to their favorite games.</p>
<p>In addition, their choice of game genres is also very single, fixed on strategy, elimination, and simulation management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2F3a93b057-1e16-4bd9-bf7e-4a50e88642e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The rankings of PC and console games are very different from those of mobile games. In addition to the simulation management games that German players love, most of the PC games on the list are relatively hardcore. <em>EA Sports FIFA 22</em>, which was just released by EA, once again topped the sales chart, which shows the German players’ love for football. It is followed by the open-world game <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched by Rockstar. The third place is the racing game <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. The fourth place is <em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, and the fifth place is <em>Minecraft</em>. Most of the games on the list can meet the needs of teaming up or have pvp modes, which can meet some competitive needs of hardcore PC players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230424%2Fc765c7f5-35c6-4ef7-a2d0-eb93d8897cad.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The game culture in Germany is very mature, and many players have been exposed to games since childhood. In addition, German players have a high willingness to pay. Due to the aging of the population, the average age of players has increased, which is also the reason why German players have relatively strong payment capabilities. As the engine of the European economy, Germany also has one of the largest game markets in Europe, with almost 60% of Germans having gaming experience.</p>
<p>Unlike Chinese players, console games still maintain a high status in Germany, but the development of mobile games has surpassed traditional games, and more than 70% of players play mobile games.</p>
<p>In addition, German players have obvious “nostalgic” characteristics. Most of the various rankings are old games that have been online for more than 2 years, and the genres are relatively single. This also brings a lot of pressure to some new products that want to enter the German market. But on the other hand, when you want to enter the German market, the selection of products is more accurate. Once a new product is accepted by players, it is easier to stabilize and settle down.</p>

    <title>How to Leverage the Positive Effects of Geographic Location Information in Game Design</title>
    <url>/2023/04/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20230508_28584_1087004/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230508/28584_1087004.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the development of mobile information technology, the technology of obtaining users’ geographical coordinates through signals has been widely used in all aspects of our lives. Naturally, geographic location information has also been widely used in games.</p>
<p>When it comes to game design based on geographic location information, the first thing that comes to mind is probably <em>Pokémon GO</em>. The gameplay of this game is based on augmented reality (AR) technology. Players need to collect, battle, and train Pokémon in the real world. In addition, based on LBS (Location Based Services) technology, players can deeply integrate the real map with the game screen and explore in the real world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ffac7fbb0-c573-4f56-a1a8-ee7a1e81ce0f.png/size/"></p>
<p>But in fact, in addition to being embedded in the gameplay, geographic location information also plays a positive role in the design of other game systems. This article will start from the system functions and briefly discuss the application of geographic location information in the design of game system functions and the positive effects it brings.</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements"><a href="#1-Using-Players’-Geographic-Information-as-a-Dimension-of-Leaderboards-to-Motivate-Players-to-Pursue-Achievements" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements"></a>1. Using Players’ Geographic Information as a Dimension of Leaderboards to Motivate Players to Pursue Achievements</h2><p>In some games with high DAU, it is very difficult for individual players to get on the global leaderboard. For those players who do not have the strength to get on the global leaderboard, but have a high demand for achievement goals, sub-leaderboards can meet their needs for a sense of achievement. The more detailed the leaderboard, the more achievement goal directions players can pursue – “With so many leaderboards, I can always excel in one.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F678a763f-437f-4511-b0fc-80cef6a46a2b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to in-game attributes, many games now introduce the concept of players’ provinces and cities in reality, and divide player groups based on players’ geographic information, so that players in the same group are in a large leaderboard. It is common in some games with strong confrontation. For example, in <em>Onmyoji Arena</em>, which everyone is familiar with, the game ranks players of each Shikigami in their province and city. The ranking reflects the level of players playing a certain hero. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Fce2bf088-2ec0-48e1-a947-14d718ff59d5.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Such a regionally-subdivided ranking, first of all, will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking. Players may have a vague perception of how many people are playing a game in the country, but their cognition of how many people are playing around them is clearer. For example, “Shanghai’s No. 1 Yoto Hime”, friends in Shanghai will have a relatively concrete feeling of the weight of this “No. 1”.</p>
<p>Secondly, the relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Friends who can get together in reality have similar life trajectories, and most of them live in nearby areas, so they have a stronger sense of the fun of regional ranking topics. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate you to pursue the ranking. For example, we are going to have a five-player game in a party. I don’t know many heroes and I quickly choose Oitsuki. My friend says, “I’ll take the mid lane, you just lie down and win. Let me, Hangzhou’s No. 8 Higanbana, carry you.” It’s not that I really care about my friend’s skills, but this kind of talk makes people feel “Oh, that’s interesting”, and the feedback from everyone increases Higanbana’s pride in this ranking.</p>
<p>This kind of ranking based on geographic location grouping is not limited to the form of a leaderboard. There are also common regional online events. Players in the same region are used as a group for internal competition, and the winning players will get corresponding achievements in the game. Although it is not in the form of a leaderboard, it can also motivate players to pursue their achievement goals. For example, the China Online Tour in <em>UNO!</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F462b365e-d0f8-4b4b-b9e6-05e52f479a84.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition"><a href="#2-Divide-Groups-Based-on-Players’-Geographic-Information-to-Increase-Motivation-for-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition"></a>2. Divide Groups Based on Players’ Geographic Information to Increase Motivation for Competition</h2><p>In addition to ranking within the group, ranking with geographic location as a natural group link and group as a unit will also motivate players’ game behavior. For example, in <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, which went viral on the Internet at the end of 2022, for this game with a very low clearance rate, on the one hand, players all hope to be the lucky one to clear the level with a small probability. On the other hand, the reason why many players keep playing tirelessly may be to help their province’s sheep team to be on the top sheep list of the day. The extremely low clearance rate and the setting of ranking by region as a group greatly stimulate players’ desire for challenge and sense of collective honor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2Ff7d70648-f953-45c3-9336-af55c979bb03.png/size/"></p>
<p>In <em>Yang Le Ge Yang</em>, regional ranking is more of a group achievement, and the individual’s sense of achievement is not so strong. At first glance, you may wonder why this regional ranking can also motivate players. This involves the relationship between individual interests and group interests. Group members will unite against outsiders, and individuals belonging to the group will hope that the group will develop better. It is a behavioral preference rooted in the human genes. The formation of this preference is related to the development of human ethnic groups, which has always been in groups.</p>
<p>First of all, people living in the same area often have a sense of belonging and identity, believing that they are a part of this place, so they have the responsibility and obligation to contribute to this place, so as to maintain and enhance the interests of their community or region. In addition, our traditional culture emphasizes the relationship between individuals and society relatively more, advocating that individuals contribute to society. Under the influence of this culture, players may have a stronger sense of responsibility and obligation to their location. And some regions are relatively strong in culture or economy, which may enhance the pride of local people in their regional identity, thereby enhancing their motivation to “help the sheep team of their province to be on the top sheep list of the day.”</p>
<h2 id="3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience"><a href="#3-Use-Real-Coordinate-Information-to-Enhance-Players’-Social-Motivation-and-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience"></a>3. Use Real Coordinate Information to Enhance Players’ Social Motivation and Experience</h2><p>The most basic use of geographic location information in games is that in the player’s personal information, the player can choose to display their city coordinates. With coordinate information, when other players view your profile, if your cities are geographically close, or even in the same city, you can quickly identify it. For example, in MMO games, players often have an in-game personal information display page, where players can display their city coordinates. Of course, players can also choose not to display them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F36833c5d-735a-4e36-ade5-323c59cefe95.png/size/"></p>
<p>Some games apply the distance information between the two parties in more detail. For example, in <em>Onmyoji</em>, players can see the distance between the speaker and their real coordinates in the chat channel. Even the game chat channel directly opens “Nearby”, which is convenient for players to directly find and interact with nearby like-minded people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F293cf958-98ae-41e9-9106-37d307478b98.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition to individuals, the game also adds the dimension of geographic location information to group interaction. Players can use the geographic location service (LBS) function to associate their location information with the Onmyoji guild. First of all, the game requires choosing a real coordinate to create a guild. Players can use the LBS function to search for nearby guilds in the real world and join them. Based on such functional logic, most of the players in the same guild are near the guild coordinates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F5b2a2907-aa74-4403-a13d-3fd9c7c6f868.png/size/"></p>
<p>The game will design such a geographic location service in social functions, which actually hits the preference that players always prefer people who are geographically closer in social interactions with strangers. This preference exists even if players do not consider meeting in person or transforming these online social interactions into offline ones.</p>
<p>The psychological distance theory believes that, taking the direct experience of the results of this time, this place, certainty, and oneself as the origin, any indirect experience in any dimension is psychologically distant. Things are scattered in the psychological space according to different dimensions, forming different types of psychological distance. Psychological distance includes four dimensions: time distance, space distance, social distance, and probability distance.</p>
<p>Players usually use various attributes as a measure of the social distance between themselves and other players, such as similar interests and hobbies (same hobby group) and similar strength levels (game combat power or rank). Similar spatial distance is also a natural attribute that quickly shortens the social distance between players, which means that the closer the players are in geographical distance, the higher their initial closeness to each other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F9382b0d7-3c9c-4c4e-9421-7b6fede7a895.png/size/"></p>
<p>And in the process of interaction, the advantages brought by geographic location are not only at the beginning. Friends who are geographically close can continue to receive more attention from players. In-group favoritism is a pattern of cognitive behavior, which means that individuals form an identity with people in the group, and therefore give more positive evaluations, allocate more resources, while giving more negative evaluations or allocating fewer resources to people outside the group. The proximity of geographic location is a kind of in-group division mark. This kind of in-group preference based on geographic area can encourage these players to communicate and support each other more, such as the phenomenon of people in the same area forming groups. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F3a2fd2db-bedd-4586-85fb-377de9c0db61.png/size/"></p>
<p>Players will prefer people who are geographically closer, which may be influenced by past social experience in addition to natural human cognitive preferences - they find that people from similar regions are more talkative and get along better. Playing games with people who are close to the geographic area, due to similarities in living background, language, cultural customs, and daily travel trajectories, it is easier to establish a common experience and common identity, thereby enhancing the sense of belonging and emotional connection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for players who have a need gap in real-world social interaction, although they are socializing in the online world, they essentially still hope to establish relatively stable social relationships. Scholar Sherry Turkle (2005) calls the identity in the virtual online world “mud” - it has fluidity, can play with and shape its own form at will, and play different roles.</p>
<p>In the world of online games, the identity of strangers is difficult to distinguish between true and false, and the truth seems to be unimportant. Because strangers lack the fulcrum of real connection, they are like duckweed that blows away. Real connection means the relative authenticity of identity, reducing the sense of haziness and ambiguity in the process of interaction. Therefore, if the online relationship is to develop further, it must provide some kind of certainty and build a trust mechanism. Players who are geographically close are more likely to have some offline contact, such as offline gatherings, group games, etc. The “face-to-face” meeting link can reduce the uncertainty of online identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230508%2F6a1ec6b0-141c-4cae-b370-eaca63fc89e2.png/size/"></p>
<p>The social penetration theory believes that the degree of self-disclosure between the two parties is the core of relationship development. The more offline contact, the more real life players present to each other. While increasing mutual trust, they will also show more aspects of real self-exposure in reality. Players have more bonds with each other, promoting the transformation of weak social ties into strong ties, and are more likely to settle into stable social relationships.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The application of geographic location information can play a certain role in motivating players’ social interaction, sense of achievement, etc. When conducting game design, we can better utilize these aspects to bring beneficial effects to the game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using players’ geographic information as a dimension of leaderboards to motivate players to pursue achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The difficulty of getting on the global leaderboard is greater. The more diversified the leaderboard, the more leaderboard achievement-seeking players can be covered.</li>
<li>Regional leaderboards will give everyone a more concrete concept of the strength represented by this ranking.</li>
<li>The relevance of ranking in the same region is also more likely to become a topic of conversation among friends. Others’ feedback on your ranking will also motivate players to pursue the ranking.</li>

    <title>The Pseudoscience of Color Psychology, Yet Widely Used in Games</title>
    <url>/2023/02/27/netease-ux-articles/news_20230508_28584_1087006/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230508/28584_1087006.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the past, many people believed that colors had some kind of mysterious power. Modern psychologists also believe that colors are related to the human brain and have a profound impact on human emotions and behavior. Data shows that when people observe objects, the first 20 seconds are basically spent on the appearance, of which the perception of color accounts for 85%, and the perception of shape accounts for 15%; after two minutes, the color drops to 75%, and after 5 minutes, it tends to be half and half.</p>
<p>The impression color gives to people is rapid, profound, and lasting, which also determines what the first impression of many things is. This article will combine color knowledge and the practical application of color in game design to reveal the answer one by one. Is color psychology really pseudoscience?</p>
<h2 id="1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts"><a href="#1-Using-Color-to-Convey-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Color to Convey Concepts"></a>1. Using Color to Convey Concepts</h2><h3 id="Physical-Characteristics"><a href="#Physical-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Physical Characteristics"></a>Physical Characteristics</h3><p>On the basis of the same elements or shapes, using different color schemes will present different themes. The well-known art concept designer OLDFISH also emphasized the importance of physical characteristics presented through colors for concept communication. At the same time, colors will also produce differences in material communication. The same shape can be expressed as silver, gold and other materials by giving different inherent colors and light and shadow relationships.</p>
<h3 id="Cultural-Characteristics"><a href="#Cultural-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Characteristics"></a>Cultural Characteristics</h3><p>Some specific colors can express certain cultural characteristics. When people habitually give a specific meaning to a certain group of colors and continue to use them, over time, they will become the symbolic color of this thing, most commonly seen in religion, aristocratic culture, ancient class systems, and customs.</p>
<p>The same color may represent different or even completely opposite meanings in different cultural backgrounds. These cultural connotations related to color will also be reflected in the design of some games. For example, in Chinese culture, red often represents festivity and good luck, while in some Western contexts it sometimes symbolizes violence, blood, and tension. Therefore, in many game scenes with an oriental background, redwood buildings or red decorations often appear, while game scenes with a Western background are relatively rare, mainly using original wood colors, gray, beige, etc. as the main color scheme of residential buildings. Of course, scene design is largely related to the era in which the game background&#x2F;worldview is located and the theme of the game itself, but as an important element in different cultures, color can also inspire many different design ideas for artists.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Characteristics"><a href="#Emotional-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Characteristics"></a>Emotional Characteristics</h3><p>The influence of color on people’s emotions is subtle, and the psychological implications of different colors are also different. To give some common examples in life, the color scheme of many fast food restaurants is red and yellow, giving people a fast-paced psychological suggestion; while hospital rooms are usually decorated in white, light blue and other light colors, which can give people a sense of stability and comfort, which is conducive to soothing emotions.</p>
<p>In the process of game design, color is also a direct and powerful way to evoke players’ emotions. Research on some players by an organization shows that yellow usually means “fun” in the hearts of players, while red usually means “anger”. Of course, these studies are not absolute, but can represent a certain color design trend, which is inseparable from the player’s psychological state. But it is undeniable that the use of different colors can indeed evoke certain specific emotions in people’s hearts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Contrasting-Color-Matching"><a href="#2-Contrasting-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrasting Color Matching"></a>2. Contrasting Color Matching</h2><p>According to the strength of the contrast of color attributes, color matching can be roughly divided into complementary colors, contrasting colors, and medium-difference colors. The stronger the contrast of color matching, the higher the recognition between colors. Many game artists use this principle to design scenes, character costumes, etc., which makes it easier to cut the picture and make the strong and weak distinct.</p>
<h3 id="Complementary-Colors"><a href="#Complementary-Colors" class="headerlink" title="Complementary Colors"></a>Complementary Colors</h3><p>Usually, we define colors with an angle of 180° on the color wheel as complementary colors, which is commonly known as “contrasting colors”. Complementary colors have the largest range of hue changes, and the resulting picture color contrast is also the strongest, thus giving people a strong visual impact. But in art design, this also means “high risk”. Too strong a contrast can easily cause disharmony and overstimulation, and it is likely to “step on thunder”.</p>
<p>However, as long as it is properly grasped, “high risk will also bring high returns”, resulting in unexpected aesthetic innovation. Usually, complementary colors have extremely strong contrast and conflict. Therefore, the use of complementary color matching is generally more challenging. Usually, the method of changing the area ratio or saturation is used to present a better visual effect.</p>
<p>Blue and orange, yellow and purple are common complementary color combinations. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the costumes of the hero Kurumi have always been the focus of players’ attention. The blue and orange complementary colors used on the chest, sleeves, and waist seal of the Chengyun Lanshou (承云兰寿) have a finishing touch effect, and at the same time set off the lively and clever character image; Huiye Shaonu (辉烨少女) uses a large area of yellow and purple. Although it is also said to be beautiful by many players, it is not as outstanding as the former in terms of color contrast and complementary effect.</p>
<h3 id="Emphasis-Color-Matching"><a href="#Emphasis-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="Emphasis Color Matching"></a>Emphasis Color Matching</h3><p>We mentioned that the three elements of color are hue (i.e., tone), lightness, and chroma (i.e., saturation). In addition to choosing different hue combinations, you can also adjust the lightness and chroma of colors to further emphasize the color relationship.</p>
<p>Especially when the lightness or saturation of a large area of color blocks is low, the color purity of a small area of modules is high, which will naturally present a very advanced sense of contrast. In a low-purity background, especially when black, white, and gray are used as the background color, a small part of high-purity color will be particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>For example, the group of single-character posters of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in the picture below has a black and gray overall background. The most eye-catching thing in the picture is the iconic symbolic items of each character, all of which are high-purity red, which directly and implicitly expresses the positioning and even related background of the character, such as the red Buddhist beads on Tsuchimikado’s wrist, the blindfold taken off by Viper Ning, and the red umbrella behind Kurumi. The art form fully reflects the implicitness of oriental narrative, creating a sense of mystery, and the visual performance is also very beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Color-Matching" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Color Matching"></a>3. The Role of Color Matching</h2><p>In addition to the intuitive visual performance that can be seen at a glance, color also has a strong psychological suggestion effect. In game design, it is also common to adjust colors to shape the appearance.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality"><a href="#Color-Expressiveness-and-Appearance-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality"></a>Color Expressiveness and Appearance Quality</h3><p>By adjusting the hue combination, lightness, and chroma, objects with the same shape can present different effects. Generally speaking, the greater the color change, or the richer the level of change, the final expression of the appearance is also very different. This difference can be cleverly transformed into “rules” of different qualities in game design.</p>
<p>For example, the four pictures below are four costumes of the female character Justina Gu in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. From left to right, the quality and value in the game increase. We can see that in terms of overall color matching, these four sets of clothes are generally relatively close, all of which are white with a reddish-brown color scheme. The default skin on the far left uses red with light brown. The color change is small and soft, and the contrast is not very strong. The expressiveness is also the weakest, corresponding to the initial quality skin in the game that can be obtained for free. Compared with the first set, the second set has no difference in shape design. The only change is that the color of the neckline and skirt is changed to jujube red, and the contrast is stronger, and the quality is also improved by one level. In addition to the more complicated shape design, the combination of white, water red and golden brown in the third set also enhances the sense of color layering. The last set is a very popular Dragon Gate - Apsaras (龙门·飞天) collaboration skin. On the whole, its background color is also white, but the bright red streamer + full body gold embellishment gives this set of costumes a sense of dignity and refinement.</p>
<p>If you further observe these four sets of clothes, the quality increases from left to right. The lightness of the red color scheme of the second to fourth sets also has different “standards”. The relatively low-quality ones mostly use colors with low lightness, and the highest-quality ones use bright red with high lightness and chroma, and the material presents a golden luster.</p>
<h3 id="Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships"><a href="#Color-Shapes-Spatial-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Color Shapes Spatial Relationships"></a>Color Shapes Spatial Relationships</h3><p>In reality, the presentation of colors will be affected by factors such as light and distance. For example, if there is extra lighting when taking portraits, the skin will appear whiter and more translucent. For example, when trying on clothes in a mall, there are often small spotlights in front of the dressing mirror, which is also to make the color of the clothes appear the most eye-catching effect.</p>
<p>In the game, the designer will use this feature in reverse, using the light and dark changes of colors to shape the spatial relationship of the scene. For example, in the scene in the picture, the rockery, stones, and trees on the right have higher color purity and are visually closer; the houses and trees in the distance have lower purity but higher brightness, and the color contrast is blurred, giving people a feeling of being illuminated by sunlight in the distance.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The above is a preliminary exploration of the use of color in game design. In many scenes where users are usually contacted, whenever a player is asked “Why do you like this game?”, many people will say without thinking that they are attracted by the exquisite graphics or unique art style of the game. Vision is the first impression many players have of a game, and then gradually goes deep into gameplay, genre, social interaction and other factors. Color plays a vital role in the “first impression”. By making good use of color matching, the design philosophy of game art can be better conveyed, and the success of commercialization can also be better assisted.</p>

    <title>Designing for the Real World Game Accessibility Features (Auditory)</title>
    <url>/2023/04/03/netease-ux-articles/news_20230510_28584_1087383/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087383.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For sighted people, even with the golden key of accessibility services, after actual operation, it is found that there are quite a few hurdles to overcome. It is even more difficult to imagine how blind people can happily play mobile games with us. Everyone jokes that poverty limits their imagination, but after seeing a set of real data, I found that my imagination is actually limited by prejudice.</p>
<p>According to the “Basic Situation Report of Visually Impaired Internet Users in China” released by the Secretariat of the China Information Accessibility Product Alliance (CAPA), there are 13 million visually impaired people in China (as of 2016), of which 91% are blind people of level one and two (as shown in the figure below). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F22cb6972-9b43-410a-adbf-609c6b3993ea.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Disability Level Ratio of 13 Million Visually Impaired People</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Among the visually impaired users surveyed, 92% use smartphones, of which 22% have used Internet software such as Didi, Kuaidi, and Uber to hail taxis, 33% have installed 11-20 applications on their mobile phones, and 83% can completely rely on screen reading functions when operating mobile phones and computers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F8d515964-5de7-40eb-957c-3b8ed52300d8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>What Visually Impaired People Usually Do Online on Their Mobile Phones</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the “2021 China Digital Inclusion User Survey Report” released in 2021, it can be seen that the completely blind group has a very high usage and dependence on smart products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe9c44f66-e0c0-4570-b993-a16ee3033a49.png/size/"></p>
<p>Combining the above two reports, we can see that 99% of completely blind people will use smartphones, and 54% of visually impaired people (91% of whom are blind) will use mobile phones to play games. So, facing the huge gaming needs of the visually impaired group, how to better solve the accessibility settings in the game has become one of the missions of game practitioners.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the gaming experience of the completely blind group, and introduce existing excellent game cases and analyze the methodology in three aspects: the auditory experience of the blind group, the guide design suitable for the blind group, and the game types suitable for the blind group.</p>
<h2 id="1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games"><a href="#1-How-Does-the-Auditory-Sense-of-the-Blind-Group-Experience-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?"></a>1. How Does the Auditory Sense of the Blind Group Experience in Games?</h2><h3 id="Sound-Design"><a href="#Sound-Design" class="headerlink" title="Sound Design"></a>Sound Design</h3><p>Sound is a very important part for blind players. We can get some clues from the existing few games specially designed for the blind: take the <em>Street Fighter</em> series as an example - every action, move, windup, and recovery will activate corresponding unique sounds.</p>
<p>First, the sounds are sorted and adjusted in a more detailed order of priority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F25d474f5-ad4a-4587-a532-b82bd3e84fc2.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Comparison of Different Sounds Visualized in the Game</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Games are not like movies. Movies will mix the sounds according to the process of the film during sound production, so that all sounds maintain the correct proportion. However, the game is completely dynamic, and all actions will change according to the player’s state. If the designer just puts the sound into the game, it must be a disaster.</p>
<p>Here, take FPS games as an example. The real situation is this: when the player shoots, he can hardly hear other sounds; but when the player’s walkie-talkie starts to speak, other sounds will become smaller to ensure that the player can hear his task goals clearly; and when an explosion occurs, other sounds will be covered up… All these arrangements can ensure the player’s pleasure in playing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F5eeb0bc5-4ae3-48eb-9e37-72a369340d83.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, when designing games for blind players, designers need to give priority to different sounds through early design, so that certain sounds “give way” to other sounds when they come out.</p>
<h3 id="Emotional-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Emotional-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Emotional Sound Feedback"></a>Emotional Sound Feedback</h3><p>For example, in parkour games, the sense of pleasure is the power that constantly supports players to continue playing. At least on the sound level, it is necessary to extend the player’s excitement and freshness, and provide certain positive feedback.</p>
<p>Then a more classic design scheme is to judge the player’s current survival state and survival time through interactive music, and the music is switched and changed in real time to match the current game progress in terms of emotion; at the same time, the sound of a large number of coins or points picked up in the game becomes the pitch that matches the tonality of the background music - that is, the random pitch within the range of the scale where the music is currently located. In this way, when the player runs continuously and eats coins, he will play a melody line that belongs only to the player and does not conflict with the background music; for example, when you eat three coins in a row and trigger three notes, you will be eager to hear the appearance of the next note, and hope that this note will be “developed” and “resolved”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fed1bb0b0-fd54-4c02-8429-e4559df84557.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Subway Surfers》 Coin Sound Effect Schematic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This is completely in line with human psychology, and it also stimulates the player’s motivation to continue playing.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound feedback during some basic system interface operations needs to rely on the strong logic and rationality of the UI at all levels to support it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F066908c4-d22b-4f39-bd28-1d32551ca370.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Because it is necessary to use sound to establish the UI operation interface, it is more necessary to have a good operation flow. Out of consideration for the blind group, it is also very important to use sound to awaken the user’s curiosity in the functional interface. Currently, the types of sounds commonly used in functional interface operations are: music, sound effects, natural sounds, human voices, and so on. Another point is whether the arrangement of elements in the interface is upward, downward, leftward, or rightward. The position in the interface exists as an interesting variable, and is generally used to express the hierarchical structure between various information elements, and the information transmission and reading order on the screen (accessibility information reading function) between them, which can help developers sort the elements in turn. The more reasonable the design of the interface and process, the more it can empower the gaming experience of the blind group.</p>
<p>In addition, excellent plot can enhance the sense of substitution of the blind group, thereby activating the picture in the heart of the blind group.</p>
<p>Sound can create atmosphere and emotion. Through different sound styles and music, different game scenes and emotions can be created, allowing completely blind players to feel the theme, style, story and other elements of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fab3c3c18-ef00-42cb-8df0-fe70132d0d16.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback"><a href="#Rich-Gesture-Sound-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Rich Gesture Sound Feedback"></a>Rich Gesture Sound Feedback</h3><p>In blind games, gesture commands are a commonly used interaction method, which can allow blind users to control the game through the touch screen, improving the operability and ease of use of the game. To make gesture commands play a better role in blind games, improvements can be made in the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design simple, easy-to-remember and intuitive gesture commands, avoiding commands that are too complex or easy to confuse.</li>
<li>Provide clear, definite and timely sound feedback so that the blind group knows which command they have executed and what effect it has produced.</li>
<li>Consider the different degrees of visual impairment of users and the adaptation problems of different types of devices, and provide multiple choices or custom options.</li>
<li>Conduct sufficient and continuous user testing and evaluation, and optimize and improve according to user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the built-in accessibility service of the iPhone binds rich gesture commands with unique sound feedback to form memory points, so as to better help the blind group to operate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F391368a4-bc68-4c7f-97b8-71b98b63abc8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without exquisite visual animation, and regardless of the design style of flatness and three-dimensionality, the focus of interaction falls on physical gestures. For example, the interactive operations performed by normal people on mobile phones, such as “single click to enter”, “long press and drag”, “slide to switch screens”, etc., are all redefined in the accessibility assistance mode. Blind people no longer need to rely on the physical buttons of the mobile phone to use various program services more deeply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fbdab9f6b-4fff-4eda-8d00-f169d837f9b8.png/size/"></p>
<p>Adding more gesture operations and corresponding sound feedback in the game can help the blind group deepen their memory of operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Good-Guidance"><a href="#2-Good-Guidance" class="headerlink" title="2. Good Guidance"></a>2. Good Guidance</h2><p>In blind games, the role of good guidance is to help players familiarize themselves with the rules, goals, operations and environment of the game, improve players’ participation and satisfaction, and reduce frustration and abandonment.</p>
<h3 id="Guidance"><a href="#Guidance" class="headerlink" title="Guidance"></a>Guidance</h3><p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> provides an enhanced listening mode, which enhances the search for high-priority targets and plays corresponding prompt sounds to remind players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F2578656d-5f6d-491f-8176-c6f93581d72e.png/size/"></p>

<p>In addition, the way to receive information should also be informed to the blind group in advance: sound can provide navigation and feedback. Through different sound effects and voice prompts, it can help completely blind players understand the game interface, operation methods, target locations, obstacles and other information, as well as the results of their actions and state changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fadd3ebdb-03e1-4437-9e01-adb26a32ace0.png/size/"></p>

<p>Instructions for wearing headphones are also very important, because the blind group will distinguish their operations and the situation they are in according to surround stereo or left and right channels. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F4470464f-c0bf-44b9-abdf-112f183cc143.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p>Since blind games need to be supplemented by narration or prompt sounds for conventional operations, it is necessary to pay attention to the problem of “speech speed”. People with normal vision usually quickly obtain content and react by receiving visual information, but as a blind group that mainly obtains content through hearing, it is necessary to plan the “functional sound” in the game in advance and open the permission or function to adjust the speed of these sounds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fc0154312-cda2-434c-b9b2-7e0923e4f183.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Positioning"><a href="#Positioning" class="headerlink" title="Positioning"></a>Positioning</h3><p>In blind games, the sound design of positioning is very important, because it can help blind players perceive space and direction, and improve the playability and immersion of the game.</p>
<p>Referenceable solutions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>At different positions, when the distance from the other party increases or decreases, frequency conversion processing is performed on the footsteps.</li>
<li>The methodology of echolocation is to use the characteristics of sound wave reflection and attenuation in space to simulate the position of the environment and the enemy. It needs to consider how to design sound sources of different types and intensities, and how to deal with echo effects and reverberation effects; it also needs to consider how to balance the relationship between sound and picture, avoiding audiovisual inconsistency or being too abstract.</li>
<li>Encode visual information into sound signals, so that the blind can perceive images through sound. Its core principle is to scan the image from left to right, map the horizontal direction to the time axis of the sound, map the vertical direction to the pitch of the sound, and map the brightness to the loudness of the sound. This forms an image-to-sound mapping, allowing the blind to hear the shape, size, color, position and other information of objects in the scene through headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: After the launch of <em>Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, in addition to the picture, some information of the character can also be judged by the change of sound alone. In the SFC version, with the help of dual-channel stereo output, if you control the character to walk from left to right, the footsteps of the character will also change accordingly, so that blind players can grasp the progress of the game through the change of sound.</p>
<p>In addition, the reading of maps and coordinates, and the detailed consideration of game special effects and dubbing are all important details from accessibility to improving the experience of the blind. </p>

<p>In the game <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, echolocation technology is used. Players can scan new spaces to determine whether there are targets that need to be fought or items that need to be collected in the space. </p>

<h2 id="3-Games-and-Gameplay-Suitable-for-the-Blind"><a href="#3-Games-and-Gameplay-Suitable-for-the-Blind" class="headerlink" title="3. Games and Gameplay Suitable for the Blind"></a>3. Games and Gameplay Suitable for the Blind</h2><p>For the types and gameplay of games that the blind group likes to play, we believe that the current blind game product types on the market mainly include fighting games, such as <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em>, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fde8aca9b-5fa4-43d6-93b5-43f5466970d4.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Fighting games are a very friendly game type for the blind group, because the game scene is relatively fixed and simple, and the movement range of the characters is also relatively simple. Secondly, these games make extensive use of audio to prompt different actions in the game, allowing the blind group to clearly understand the situation of the game. In the game <em>Street Fighter</em>, many blind players can reach high ranks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcec3b16f-a6a7-43bf-bd1a-3fd9d9754449.gif/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, there are casual games, card games, etc. In addition, there are “audio games” dominated by sound, which is a game type specially designed for the completely blind group. Like the game types mentioned above, they have quite excellent and complete sound effects and game dubbing.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Although so far, the number of games for the blind and other disabled people is still very small, and many of them are small games with relatively simple functions, from the color change system for color-blind players in the Japanese national mobile game <em>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</em> in the early years, to the NS version of <em>1-2-Switch</em> where blind players can play with normal people through the HD vibration function of the controller, and games with excellent sound effects such as the <em>Street Fighter</em> series, we have also seen more and more game developers making efforts in this area. As a blind player interviewed said:</p>
<p>“If you can play games like normal people, you can communicate with other people like normal people. I think games are a tool for communication. After all, it’s better to enjoy together than to enjoy alone.”</p>

    <title>Is the Supply in the Game Meeting Your Shopping Needs</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087389.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a game, player&#x2F;consumer churn is one of the most critical issues in its life cycle. Consumer churn refers to the situation where players who have a history of consumption in the game and whose cumulative consumption amount has reached a certain scale, but have not consumed for a recent period. Usually, this type of population overlaps with game churn users to a certain extent. When players churn from the game, they will naturally no longer have in-game consumption. In another case, players remain in the game, but churn in consumption. These players are often consumers that game manufacturers are very eager to retain, and are relatively easy to win back. The good news is that they are still interested in the game and are more likely to consume again than churned game players. The bad news is that the current supply in the game does not meet the needs of these players, resulting in player churn in consumption.</p>
<p>The reasons why players churn from the game are varied, such as dissatisfaction with the game’s character design, gameplay content, and other mechanisms, or the low input-output ratio during the cultivation process, or social and personal reasons. The recall of such players is often random. They may come back if the updated content of the game is attractive enough, or if they have looked around and there are no other games. Of course, we can also reach out through information channels to recall churned players, but in general, the effect of recall is limited without solving the fundamental problems. The purpose of analyzing and investigating such players is not only to win back these players, but also to mend the fold after the sheep are lost, find problems in time, and prevent other players from churning due to the same problems.</p>
<p>The reasons why players are still playing the game but no longer consuming are even more worthy of insight. We hope to hear their demands and understand how to keep them in the game.</p>
<h2 id="1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits"><a href="#1-Adjust-Supply-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Habits" class="headerlink" title="1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits"></a>1. Adjust Supply According to Players’ Consumption Habits</h2><p>According to our research, different players have different consumption habits and game goals in the game, and their consumption needs will also vary. An overly simple or “taken for granted” supply structure obviously cannot satisfy the consumption experience of various players.</p>
<p>In terms of players’ consumption habits, the same game will include various consumption habits such as daily micro-transactions, large-scale transactions at key points, and on-demand transactions. The first two forms have a large player base and overlap. According to the research results, we classify the props mentioned by players in their self-reports. Overall, the consumption content in the game can be divided into basic consumables, scarce props, and decorative props (clothing, skins, etc.). Among them, basic consumables are often low-priced props that meet the basic clearance needs of the game. For example, props that obtain the number of game challenges or game duration, cheap props that are consumed a lot in basic enhancement or other basic game experiences; while scarce props are props that players need when they deeply experience the game and have high requirements for the attributes of characters or weapons. Generally, they are expensive and limited in supply.</p>
<p>The consumption habit of daily micro-transactions usually corresponds to basic consumables and a very small number of scarce props. For example, players purchase basic commodities such as game passes and weekly cards, and immediately purchase a small number of specific props or daily&#x2F;weekly gift packs containing the props according to immediate card draw and dress-up needs. The consumption of such players is basically used to meet the basic needs of the game. Without the stimulation of deep needs, the consumption amount will not change much. It is enough to retain and maintain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0f87a0e7-7ef0-401e-95b4-a0522e3756ea.png/size/"></p>
<p>The consumption habit of large-scale transactions at key points usually corresponds to the “stockpiling” of scarce props. For example, players specifically wait for activity nodes such as anniversaries, festivals, and new seasons to purchase the required props in large quantities at discounted prices, but they will not purchase them at the original price at ordinary times. Players who make large-scale transactions at key points are likely to exhibit “consumption churn” characteristics multiple times in their consumption life cycle. There are two reasons. First, players who make large-scale transactions at activity nodes have certain considerations for cost performance, and often use the “lowest discount” that has appeared in the game as a standard to measure whether they should buy; second, when the “stockpiling” is not used up, there will be no consumption of the same props at the next discount node.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the consumption frequency of players who make large-scale transactions at key points, one is to maintain a relatively stable node discount system and be cautious about breaking prices. Every price break will raise players’ psychological expectations for discounts and increase players’ dissatisfaction and wait-and-see attitude towards subsequent node discounts; the other is to pay attention to the activity cycle of each prop, and avoid two consecutive waves of activities focusing on the same prop, so as to reduce the situation where the consumption frequency decreases due to inventory. In addition, players who make large-scale transactions at key points are more concerned about the cost-effectiveness of consumption relative to the total consumption price. They adopt a pricing system of “increasing discounts with increasing consumption”, such as activities like “x% off for purchases over xx”.</p>
<p>Players who make on-demand transactions are usually “not short of money” and buy as they wish. For scarce props that can be bought daily, they do not wait for activities and do not consider cost-effectiveness much. They buy immediately when they need them. Such players have low price sensitivity. Under the condition of ensuring game balance and mechanics, there will be consumption if there is supply. After all, in most game designs, the scarcity of scarce props is extremely serious.</p>
<p>And according to the research results, it is speculated that the reasonable and small increase in daily supply will not affect the sales of large-scale transactions at key points. First, scarce props are always scarce resources under a reasonable supply system, and will not cause stockpiling at key points due to a small increase in daily supply. Second, the overlap between players who make on-demand transactions daily and players who wait for discount nodes is limited. The two systems do not have a high degree of competition and exclusivity.</p>
<h2 id="2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings"><a href="#2-Adjust-Strategies-According-to-Players’-Consumption-Feelings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings"></a>2. Adjust Strategies According to Players’ Consumption Feelings</h2><p>In terms of consumption mechanisms, the two strategies currently commonly used in games are bundled sales and probability consumption. For example, bundled sales include combining different props and providing discounted gift packs and bundles; probability consumption includes various forms such as card draw, loot boxes, and probability enhancement. Player feedback on both mechanisms is very controversial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fa7e6e292-6fbe-4843-991a-17d90e363018.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Bundled-Sales"><a href="#Bundled-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Bundled Sales"></a>Bundled Sales</h3><p>Bundled sales include three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted purchase:</strong> When consumers purchase product A, they can purchase product B at a price lower than the market price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified price sale:</strong> Product A and product B are not priced separately, but are sold at a bundled unified price;</li>
<li><strong>Unified packaging sale:</strong> Product A and product B are sold in a unified package.</li>
</ul>
<p>The binding and mandatory nature of the three forms increase in turn. An important condition for unified price sales and unified packaging bundled sales is the complementarity between products. For example, the bundling of a set of fashion, or the bundling of various props required for a certain task. The complementarity between these products is strong enough, and bundled sales are a win-win situation for game revenue and player experience. However, it is counterproductive to adopt or bundle products that are not complementary or even have no complementarity.</p>
<p>In our research, players often give feedback that they are not satisfied with the content of the gift pack. Even for the same gift pack, the parts that different players are not satisfied with are also different. The gift pack content that this player thinks is redundant and a waste of money may be the reason why another player buys the gift pack. And this separation also shows that the bundling of this kind of gift pack has failed. Not only is there no complementarity between the different contents of the gift pack, but the target users are also too different. It is not recommended to adopt the strong binding method of unified price sale or unified packaging sale for this kind of combination. It is more suitable for the bundling method of discounted purchase, giving consumers the freedom to choose. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F1395ab05-de51-441f-8906-ece0369e9d43.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Probability-Consumption"><a href="#Probability-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="Probability Consumption"></a>Probability Consumption</h3><p>According to expected utility theory, players’ satisfaction with probability consumption is related to their personal risk utility function. In economics and finance, the risk preferences of market participants are divided into three categories: risk averse, risk neutral, and risk appetite, and it is believed that most people are risk-averse.</p>
<p>The utility function of risk averters is strictly concave, as shown in the figure below, U(E(W)) &gt; E(U(W)). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F371e25cb-e0bf-44fc-b4e6-69a3a8ba8227.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, when there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get 50 yuan</li>
<li>50% chance of getting 0 yuan, 50% chance of getting 100 yuan</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the average return is the same, risk averters will prefer “certain 50 yuan” rather than the risky option, that is, “the utility of 50 yuan” is greater than “the average of the utility of 0 yuan and the utility of 100 yuan”. The utility of the latter is only equivalent to “the income brought by certain CE (for example, 40 yuan)”.</p>
<p>According to the decision weight function of prospect theory, the decision weight of small probability events will be higher, which explains why people buy lottery tickets and are willing to draw prizes in the game for the small probability of winning the jackpot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fe46d0d77-0948-41b5-b0ab-234ee927c81b.png/size/"></p>
<p>RP in the figure is the risk premium, that is, the difference between the determined income and the income from taking risks, which is the compensation required by investors for taking risks themselves. For risk averters, in the face of probability consumption such as lottery, probability enhancement, etc., in order to obtain the best or successful enhancement, the amount of probability consumption they are willing to pay will be less than their inner pricing of the target, and the difference is the risk premium.</p>
<p>Therefore, players will complain more during probability consumption: only when “the pricing of the drawing result” ≥ “the amount of probability consumption + risk premium” can it be possible to bring better psychological benefits than certain consumption. This also shows that the pricing of the guaranteed goods in the guarantee mechanism of probability consumption, or the expected price of consumers, needs to match “the amount of consumption + risk premium” in order to bring a satisfactory consumption experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Players’ consumption habits are different, and they are accompanied by differences in consumption timing, types of consumed props, and consumption amount. Based on this, the supply quantity and rhythm of game props need to be reconsidered to further meet consumer demand. In terms of sales strategies, although bundled sales and probability consumption have become widely used methods in games, through consumer feedback and related theoretical research, from the perspective of optimizing consumer experience, the application of the two methods still has shortcomings. Bundled sales can be improved through simple and effective improvement methods, while the optimization method of probability consumption still needs further research and investigation.</p>

    <title>A Psychological Perspective on Game Review Sections</title>
    <url>/2023/04/14/netease-ux-articles/news_20230510_28584_1087395/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087395.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Today, online reviews are an important channel for consumers to obtain product information, and their importance is even increasing. As the “trendsetters” of the Internet, game players are also active in major game review lists, forums, official Weibo accounts, super topics… Their comments on the game are a manifestation of the game’s reputation, and will become a reference for other players and even affect whether new players are willing to try it out.</p>
<p>When a player wants to see game-related news, they may go to TapTap to see the ratings, they may go to Weibo to see the hot topics, they may go to Tieba to see the guides, or they may go to the official account to see related news… What kind of impact do these TapTap ratings, comments under Weibo posts, and posts in Tieba have on viewers? This article starts from a psychological perspective, combining some psychological theories and examples to explain the interesting phenomena in the game review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fd56d36ae-ad72-48f6-85ee-18b60366fa25.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words"><a href="#1-Is-a-Picture-Worth-a-Thousand-Words" class="headerlink" title="1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?"></a>1. Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words?</h2><p>Pictures and text are two main forms of reviews. People usually think that pictures are more convincing than text, the so-called “no picture, no truth”, but in the game field, are picture reviews also more effective than text reviews?</p>
<p>When players read reviews, it is actually a process of receiving, processing, and interpreting information. In psychology, there is a dual processing theory of widely disseminated information that can explain this process. This theory describes that in the process of information processing and decision-making, there are two independent but mutually influencing systems - the analytical system and the experiential system. The analytical system is biased towards the ideal, and requires relatively large cognitive resources to integrate information, and the process is relatively slow; while the experiential system is fast and relatively superficial.</p>
<p>After understanding the information processing process, let’s look at picture reviews and text reviews. For everyone, pictures are more concrete and intuitive than text. We can see the prominent content from the picture at a glance; while text can describe more essential information, but it requires a certain amount of reading and time to understand, and is more abstract than pictures.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific content, under the influence of the characteristics of different types of reviews, pictures can relatively activate the players’ experiential system, while text can activate the players’ analytical system. In this case, games, as a hedonic sensory product, picture reviews can provide some specific and intuitive player feelings, matching the fast experiential system processing path. Therefore, in the game review section, picture reviews are often more likely to influence players’ emotions than text reviews, that is, they are more effective. If the game is not a hedonic and sensory product, but a practical product, then text reviews are more useful than a “fancy” picture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ff17368ef-a770-4bae-a98b-1269b1aece40.png/size/"></p>
<p>Of course, the real review section will not be like a psychology laboratory, with only single text reviews or picture reviews. There are also many content with both pictures and text, and then there will be a superimposed effect.</p>
<h2 id="2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews"><a href="#2-Too-Much-is-as-Bad-as-Too-Little-Positive-Reviews-vs-Negative-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews"></a>2. Too Much is as Bad as Too Little? Positive Reviews vs. Negative Reviews</h2><p>A review may be positive and complimentary, or it may be negative, critical, or even “flaming”. In psychology, the positive and negative and neutral aspects of a review are collectively referred to as “review valence.”</p>
<p>As everyone should know, positive reviews have a positive effect, and negative reviews will bring negative impressions and dissemination power, and the negative impact of negative reviews is higher than the impact of positive reviews. You can imagine whether a one-star negative review on TapTap has a much greater impact than a five-star positive review.</p>
<p>But for games, this special product, it is not difficult to find that in places like Tieba and forums, negative and neutral reviews are far more numerous than positive reviews, and this is mostly the case for games. In this case, the review section seems to cause a huge blow to the game. But in fact, we need to understand that behind these negative reviews are players with poor gaming experiences. Compared to players with more positive gaming experiences, they are more willing to speak out and express their “unhappiness”, on the one hand, to seek resonance, on the other hand, they also hope that the game official can improve these bad experiences in time; in addition, many psychology scholars have found through research that the effect of review valence is an inverted U-shaped curve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fc7e6933f-54bf-42af-b22f-ff21b44c0942.png/size/"></p>
<p>The so-called inverted U-shaped curve describes that when people see reviews that are biased towards negative, they may have negative views on the product, but as more and more negative information appears and the degree becomes deeper, people’s trust in the reviews begins to rise and then declines. That is, compared with people’s extreme reviews, everyone is more inclined to believe in moderate review valence.</p>
<p>In addition to the content described by the review itself, the characteristics of the person viewing and reading the review will also have a great impact. This article briefly cites one example: the player’s own regulatory focus level. Regulatory focus level is a self-regulation process of people, divided into promotion focus and prevention focus. Promotion-focused players focus on growth, pay attention to positive results and magnify them, commonly speaking, they are more optimistic, and see more of “what can be gained”; while prevention-focused players focus on “what they will lose”, and strive to minimize their negative results.</p>
<p>To give a common example, a player draws a prize in the game, and the probability of winning is 80%. A promotion-focused player will feel that their probability of winning is very close to 100%, and it seems to be within easy reach, eager to try; while a prevention-focused player believes that they have a 20% chance of not getting it, and they are concerned about what they might lose.</p>
<p>Observing the relationship between the player’s own regulatory focus level and review valence, it is not difficult to find that for promotion-focused players, positive reviews are more useful than negative reviews, and they pay more attention to the positive gains in the reviews; while for prevention-focused players, negative reviews have a greater impact than positive reviews.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses"><a href="#3-The-Role-of-Official-Responses" class="headerlink" title="3. The Role of Official Responses"></a>3. The Role of Official Responses</h2><p>When we look at the review sections of some games, we often find a phenomenon, that is, the official “picks” or replies. In addition to the transmission of information itself, these replies actually have other effects.</p>
<p>Official replies have a positive effect on users. Let’s not talk about the specific content of the reply, but the behavior itself has a positive impact - research shows that in terms of the game development team directly facing the voices of players, direct interaction with everyone and collecting suggestions is a manifestation of the developer’s operation plan. A high reply rate reflects the official’s good operation planning and attitude to a certain extent. In games, the active response of the official shows that the development team attaches great importance to the suggestions of players, pays attention to everyone’s feedback and the status of the game, and also helps potential “cloud players” get to know the official and reduce the perceived negative risks. Some players even call for replies from the official in the review section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fd7b0e7b7-7122-493e-825a-36319208caf3.png/size/"></p>
<p>So, how should game developers reply to players in order to achieve better results? This is related to the persona, the timeliness of the reply, and the specific form of the review.</p>
<p>First, you can consider positioning a specific persona. Why have a persona? For players, most development teams are far away from them. Even if the developers feel that they are listening to what players say most of the time and use it as a basis for changes, many players still don’t notice. When trying to communicate with players, targeted replies can indeed close this distance, but replies from the cold “xxx development team” and “xxx planner” are not obvious in closing the distance. If a clear persona can be established, especially one that is combined with the game’s own mechanics, worldview, characters, etc., it can have a better effect in closing the distance, easing the atmosphere, and operating the community. The cute loli of two-dimensional games, the female priest in the Western medieval background, the commander of FPS or military games, the injured companion of the doomsday survival game, etc., are all specific personas brewed by game developers under this strategy.</p>
<p>The second is the timeliness of the reply. Diagnostic theory refers to the process by which people judge the importance of a piece of information to themselves when they come into contact with it. Therefore, when information with high diagnostic value appears, people will immediately be attracted by this information and use it to help them make judgments. The official reply is diagnostic information in the entire review process, and the faster the official reply speed, the more it can grasp the player’s psychology in time, reflecting the high efficiency of the producer and the importance attached to the player. For example, the timely response of the game <em>UNO!</em> on TapTap reflects the players’ love for the official’s timely response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F2da6cf05-a38b-41d4-bac3-de96eed32eee.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F81d0369a-f88f-4180-a54a-9746afd884ba.png/size/"></p>
<p>How the producer replies to the player is also related to the specific form of the review. In the game’s review section, we will see some negative reviews. In response to these negative reviews, is it better to “admit mistakes” and reply “will improve”, or to analyze the reasons for the player’s negative experience with the player? This is actually related to whether the player’s evaluation is emotional or attribute-based.</p>
<p>Emotional evaluation refers to the player’s overall evaluation is relatively subjective, without the support of various examples, such as “so bad”, “don’t like” and other replies full of emotional words. At this time, if the official reply “admits mistakes”, apologizes and promises to improve, the player will further attribute the responsibility of the problem to the producer itself, and think that the official is perfunctory to him&#x2F;her. At this time, a “defensive” reply will be more useful, such as appropriately introducing the better aspects of the game to the player, reducing the player’s bad attribution to the game itself; while attribute-based evaluation is relatively objective compared to emotional evaluation, and will describe specific problems. At this time, a reply of “admitting mistakes” is more useful, supplemented by specific improvement plans may make players feel the sincerity of the official.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>This article mainly introduces the form of reviews, positive and negative valence, and some content of official replies, and discusses them in conjunction with relevant psychological theories. In fact, there are many more interesting phenomena in the review section, and the degree of influence of reviews on players is also different. Paying attention to the review section can help user researchers and development teams better understand players’ thoughts and needs, and explore the possibility of attracting new players.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230510/28584_1087397.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Game loading design has undergone iterations and innovations along with the development of the game industry. It can even be cleverly designed in combination with game style and story, bringing players a better sense of immersion and a more interesting gaming experience. This article will introduce the development path of game loading, focus on the design methods of game loading, and analyze the design art of game loading from the two aspects of strong perception and weak perception of game loading.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Path-of-Development-From-Appearance-to-Elimination"><a href="#1-The-Path-of-Development-From-Appearance-to-Elimination" class="headerlink" title="1. The Path of Development: From Appearance to Elimination"></a>1. The Path of Development: From Appearance to Elimination</h2><h3 id="The-Original-Meaning-“Reducing-Anxiety”"><a href="#The-Original-Meaning-“Reducing-Anxiety”" class="headerlink" title="The Original Meaning - “Reducing Anxiety”"></a>The Original Meaning - “Reducing Anxiety”</h3><p>Looking back on the time when playing Famicom games, you will find that you don’t seem to have any memory of the game loading screen. This is because the game capacity at that time was small, the storage medium was a cartridge, and the reading speed was fast. The game could basically run without loading.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the storage medium for games became magnetic tape. The popular game equipment was a home computer equipped with an 8-bit microprocessor and 64k of memory. The computer read data according to the rotation of the magnetic tape. The loading time of more than ten minutes would inevitably lead to misunderstanding and anxiety about “computer crashed?” if only a black screen was displayed to the player. So the text loading prompt appeared, but this simple transition from static to dynamic form could only barely pass the boring time of loading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0360da6b-d251-43ec-8b94-ce4fb50083ac.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Compared with the monotonous text prompts, many games chose to use original paintings as loading screens to help players pass the time. For the art resources that were suppressed by program restrictions at that time, this was a rare opportunity for “high-definition” display. Although the loading time was extended by 10% due to the call of art materials, this also became a rare opportunity for players to see “high-definition” pictures, so it was very popular. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcd8931bf-1683-438c-8832-3ee073ac1316.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Game Screen (left) and Loading Screen (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>By the end of the 1980s, progress bars had already begun to be used in games. Although the first game to design a progress bar is no longer testable, this design that can intuitively reduce the player’s waiting anxiety is still not outdated.</p>
<h3 id="Pioneering-Design-“Game-in-Game”"><a href="#Pioneering-Design-“Game-in-Game”" class="headerlink" title="Pioneering Design - “Game in Game”"></a>Pioneering Design - “Game in Game”</h3><p>With the upgrade of software and hardware, the game reading speed is faster. In Namco’s <em>Ridge Racer</em> in 1993, the game changed the previous loading form and placed the playable mini-game <em>Galaxian</em> in it, making the 30-second loading time pass abnormally fast, and the response in the player community was very good. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0eb88cdd-42e5-40dd-beea-ee425a7b852d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Loading game “Galaxian” in “Ridge Racer”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Although Namco applied for a patent for the mini-game in the loading process - “auxiliary game”, which created a shackle for its creation, the mini-game in this patent and the main game are two separate games. Later generations cleverly avoided this point and loaded part of the main game code to make it a mini-game. Part of the main game content was migrated and designed into an interactive game loading, which achieved the design of “game in game” and also made the way of game loading enter a more distinctive new stage.</p>
<h3 id="Unremitting-Pursuit-“Eliminate”-Loading"><a href="#Unremitting-Pursuit-“Eliminate”-Loading" class="headerlink" title="Unremitting Pursuit - “Eliminate” Loading"></a>Unremitting Pursuit - “Eliminate” Loading</h3><p>Whether it is a static prompt, a dynamic picture, or an interactive mini-game, these are just to distract the player’s attention. However, the player knows that it is loading, and the game experience is inevitably affected. “Elimination” is the optimal solution that does not affect the game experience and concentration, and this is also the unremitting pursuit of many game loading designs.</p>
<p>In 2005, <em>Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland</em> directly used the no-loading screen as a selling point of the game, and players could experience the thrill of seamless exploration. It connects the game map through passages. When players enter the enclosed space of the passage, the map is loaded, allowing players to complete the loading unknowingly while experiencing the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F0737e675-bc3b-419e-b097-326794ca977f.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="2-A-Thousand-Producers-Have-a-Thousand-Loading-Design-Methods"><a href="#2-A-Thousand-Producers-Have-a-Thousand-Loading-Design-Methods" class="headerlink" title="2. A Thousand Producers Have a Thousand Loading Design Methods"></a>2. A Thousand Producers Have a Thousand Loading Design Methods</h2><p>The player experience in the game will inevitably be affected by memory reading, network speed, and response speed. Players often cannot get the feedback they want immediately after operating, and always have to wait for a while.</p>
<p>The Doherty Threshold theory points out that when the user’s command is executed by the system and the answer is returned within 400 milliseconds, it can keep them focused, improve productivity, and improve the negative experience of waiting. Extending the Doherty Threshold theory to the application of game loading design methods, it can be found that giving players timely feedback during game loading and the perceptibility of the waiting feedback process can maintain the player’s concentration and provide a good game experience.</p>
<p>The strong perception of game loading emphasizes the visualization of the feedback loading process and clarifies the waiting progress. The weak perception of the game loading process emphasizes the timeliness of feedback, so that players are unconsciously in the process of waiting.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Loading-Design-with-Strong-Perception"><a href="#Game-Loading-Design-with-Strong-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Game Loading Design with Strong Perception"></a>Game Loading Design with Strong Perception</h3><p>In the game loading design that players can clearly perceive, regardless of its accuracy, the visual form can well reduce their waiting anxiety. The flexible use of loading animations, progress bars, splash pages, and art resources are commonly used design methods.</p>
<p>● <strong>Progress Bar</strong></p>
<p>Animation is a good way to attract players visually, and the progress bar is the best form of waiting time visualization. The progress bar can be designed in combination with elements that reflect acceleration, connection, etc. in the game, and with meaningful animation effects, it can give more vitality to the functional loading form. For example, in <em>Onmyoji</em>, the loading progress bar is displayed by the Shikigami Usagi, who has the attribute of accelerating assistance, riding a magic frog and jumping forward, which is interesting and vivid and has the meaning of the game world view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ffb69fcf5-e551-49d8-a58b-d0b6ed4fc062.gif/size/"></p>
<p>● <strong>Splash Page</strong></p>
<p>The splash page can not only bring a unique transition effect, but also has a fascinating guiding effect. Common forms include opening doors, closing fans, turning pages, notes, and so on. In <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the splash screen and fading animation are combined with black and white photos of the scenery, which directly brings people’s thoughts into the western world of the twentieth century. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp"><a href="#nbsp" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F950eb662-ca7b-43cd-aca7-ca7e44ec5867.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“Red-Dead-Redemption”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“Red-Dead-Redemption”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “Red Dead Redemption”"></a><em>Loading display of “Red Dead Redemption”</em></h2><p>● <strong>Art Resources</strong></p>
<p>Art resources are also the most commonly used content for showing off skills in game loading, which can increase players’ perceived value of the game style and establish their trust in the game. For example, the exquisite original paintings allow players to appreciate the exquisite production of game art, and also bring players a relaxed and pleasant waiting experience; the display of game models during loading, and even some free interactions, can bring players a unique experience different from the rhythm of the game. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-1"><a href="#nbsp-1" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F62dd7e53-537b-4ebd-a42a-8ce2d49df667.png/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“The-Elder-Scrolls-V”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“The-Elder-Scrolls-V”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “The Elder Scrolls V”"></a><em>Loading display of “The Elder Scrolls V”</em></h2><p>The loading form of excellent art resources can also help the connection of the game plot. For example, the loading screen of <em>The Witcher 3</em> is a plot introduction, which helps players recall the main line and also brings a movie-level look and feel. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-2"><a href="#nbsp-2" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Ff6973e83-3dfd-4592-939e-2009b6f58d86.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Loading-display-of-“The-Witcher-3”"><a href="#Loading-display-of-“The-Witcher-3”" class="headerlink" title="Loading display of “The Witcher 3”"></a><em>Loading display of “The Witcher 3”</em></h2><h3 id="Game-Loading-Design-with-Weak-Perception"><a href="#Game-Loading-Design-with-Weak-Perception" class="headerlink" title="Game Loading Design with Weak Perception"></a>Game Loading Design with Weak Perception</h3><p>The goal of weakly perceived loading design is to allow players to spend the game loading time unknowingly, by cleverly using “blinders” to naturally turn the loading screen into a part of the game.</p>
<p>● <strong>Passage</strong></p>
<p>In the game’s elevators, cable cars, or winding aisles, the player’s forward speed will be limited, thus giving the game ample loading time. The design of the passage is widely used in the game loading design of weak perception. For example, there are always many elevators in Hidetaka Miyazaki’s games, and the game completes the loading of switching scene resources while the player is riding the elevator. In Souls-like games, two large scenes are usually connected by a narrow cave or an empty dungeon, hiding the loading process outside the narrow space. In <em>God of War III</em>, players control the characters to fly in the tunnel to avoid falling rocks, perfectly combining the passage with interactive loading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fcfc9521f-9f2d-446b-aaa0-7a8f8fa4bffb.gif/size/"></p>
<p>● <strong>Slow Walking</strong></p>
<p>Slow walking is a loading form that is more difficult for players to detect. The slowed footsteps before entering the plot, and even when the game is preloading subsequent resources, in order to prevent the player from walking too fast, there will be settings such as swamps, narrow gaps that can only be passed slowly, or deliberately tripping the character, etc. to delay time for loading. These are the means used by the production team to use actions and terrain to make the game loading and game content more naturally connected. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-3"><a href="#nbsp-3" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2Fa7d081ee-cd11-4685-8a0b-94d0c8bf0ba9.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Slow-walking-loading-of-“God-of-War-4”"><a href="#Slow-walking-loading-of-“God-of-War-4”" class="headerlink" title="Slow walking loading of “God of War 4”"></a><em>Slow walking loading of “God of War 4”</em></h2><p>● <strong>Camera Movement</strong></p>
<p>In fact, it is not difficult to perfectly hide the loading process in the game. The game only needs to limit the player’s perspective through the camera to easily hide the loading process from view. As early as the PS1 era, there were applications of using the camera to cover up loading, such as in <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, as Spyro flies, the game perspective changes from the ground to the sky, hiding the loading process of ground resources. In <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, the close-up shot is used to express the heroine’s inner activities and follow her perspective to complete the scene switching. </p>
<h2 id="nbsp-4"><a href="#nbsp-4" class="headerlink" title="&nbsp;"></a>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230510%2F41434d85-67ce-483b-9c50-8aba735c4208.gif/size/"></h2><h2 id="Close-up-loading-in-“Hellblade-Senua’s-Sacrifice”"><a href="#Close-up-loading-in-“Hellblade-Senua’s-Sacrifice”" class="headerlink" title="Close-up loading in “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”"></a><em>Close-up loading in “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice”</em></h2><h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Today, the design of game loading is not limited to specific routines or blindly hiding. Instead, it is constantly exploring the perfect integration of game loading with game content and worldview. More and more games are carefully designed between maps, and even no trace of loading can be seen.</p>
<p>Due to the technical development of memory reading speed, the current game loading process cannot be truly eliminated. While technology is sprinting forward to accelerate loading, the content design of game loading has become an art. It can be cleverly designed in combination with the game style and story narration, which can not only help the game improve the worldview, but also optimize the user experience, increase retention, and bring players a better sense of immersion and a more interesting gaming experience.</p>

    <title>Fault-Tolerant Design in Games How to Apply Postel&#39;s Law</title>
    <url>/2023/06/23/netease-ux-articles/news_20230628_28584_1095677/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230628/28584_1095677.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just like the Roman god Janus (and many politicians), every Web application has two faces: its ‘human face’ interacts with people, and the machine face interacts with computer systems.” —— “Your Website has Two Faces” by Lyle Mullican</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human thinking is different from that of machines. Human understanding of information is fuzzy, variable, and broad, while machines can only recognize data that conforms to a specific structure. How can the two understand each other and achieve a balance between input and output? This requires certain fault-tolerant design, so that the product can use “two faces” to interact with people and machines, respectively. This article will introduce the theoretical basis behind this - Postel’s Law, and introduce its application in game fault-tolerant design with examples.</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Postel’s-Law"><a href="#1-What-is-Postel’s-Law" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Postel’s Law?"></a>1. What is Postel’s Law?</h2><p>First, let’s understand the content and origin of Postel’s Law. Postel’s Law (Robustness Principle) is also known as the robustness principle. In 1980, computer scientist Jonathan Bruce Postel released an early specification of the TCP protocol. In the specification, he proposed this law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Be conservative in what you send” means that the product should abide by certain specifications when displaying content to users; “be liberal in what you accept” means that when receiving user input, non-standard input should be allowed. The core idea it expresses is: the product should have a certain fault tolerance. This has become a design guide in the computer field, and has been widely used in game interaction&#x2F;user experience design.</p>
<h2 id="2-Allow-Diversity-Tolerate-Errors-and-Exceptions"><a href="#2-Allow-Diversity-Tolerate-Errors-and-Exceptions" class="headerlink" title="2. Allow Diversity, Tolerate Errors and Exceptions"></a>2. Allow Diversity, Tolerate Errors and Exceptions</h2><p>When designing a game system, we cannot only allow players to enter the format that the machine can recognize, but also consider the diversity of users, accept and adapt to more flexible and diverse input and operations, and design corresponding processing methods.</p>
<h3 id="Allow-Players-to-Perform-Arbitrary-Operations"><a href="#Allow-Players-to-Perform-Arbitrary-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Allow Players to Perform Arbitrary Operations"></a>Allow Players to Perform Arbitrary Operations</h3><p>We may have had this experience. Sometimes, when we enter incorrect text or ambiguous content in the search box, the software can still give the desired search results, as if it has “figured out” our thoughts. In this process, the program does not limit input when facing the user. Even if the content is wrong or invalid, it will not crash or report an error. Instead, it will process the input content autonomously after receiving the input, showing a high degree of tolerance. We don’t need to delve into the program implementation behind this, we just need to know that this is in line with Postel’s Law.</p>
<p>The nickname box in <em>Elden Ring</em> also handles the input of spaces in a similar way. Players can enter spaces at will without any error prompts. But when the confirm button is pressed, the program will automatically process the content, delete the spaces at the beginning and end, and the extra spaces in the middle, so that the nickname becomes a format that conforms to the rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F246be872-95b7-4eb5-bb6e-9edbf587b7aa.gif/size/"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="Input-Method-Adaptation"><a href="#Input-Method-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Input Method Adaptation"></a>Input Method Adaptation</h3><p>Games have a variety of input methods. Taking computer games as an example, the input methods can be a controller or keyboard and mouse. Many games can recognize these different input methods and give corresponding responses, so that they can tolerate and meet the different operating needs of players.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has adaptively processed the input method: when no controller is connected, it will default that the player is using keyboard and mouse operations, and the interface will also display keyboard and mouse prompts; when the player connects a controller, the game will automatically recognize and switch the operation mode to controller operation, and the interface prompts will also become controller icons accordingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fb18e459e-cfbc-4710-abe1-a200a4631fd2.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Input Method Adaptation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Output-Method-Adaptation"><a href="#Output-Method-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Output Method Adaptation"></a>Output Method Adaptation</h3><p>Game products are usually not limited to running on one platform or one system. We need to adapt to screen resolutions, device types, and operating systems to reduce the impact of different device conditions on interface effects and operating experience. Taking <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, in addition to running on various mobile phones, it can also be played through an emulator. When we drag the interface to change to any size, we can see that the interface layout and component positions are automatically adjusted, and the interface can always maintain a reasonable and clear presentation effect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F1d8d254c-23d5-4d86-bb20-fa53ce77663d.gif/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Revelation M》 Interface Adaptation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Exception-Handling"><a href="#Exception-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Exception Handling"></a>Exception Handling</h3><p>Various abnormal situations such as network delay and disconnection may occur during the game running process, which is difficult to avoid. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider in advance and design the processing method when developing the game, which can prevent problems such as process loss and data damage caused by abnormal situations. Disconnect protection and reconnection, automatic saving and other functions are common exception handling methods:</p>
<p>If the controller is disconnected during the game process of <em>Dead Cells</em>, a “Controller Disconnected” prompt will pop up and the game will be automatically paused to avoid the character being out of control and affecting the game process. If the controller is reconnected, the prompt will disappear and the game will automatically resume. </p>

<p>In <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, players can manually save the game, and the system also automatically saves frequently (there will be an icon prompt on the interface when saving). If you encounter a special situation during the game and don’t have time to save manually, don’t worry, you can find these automatic saves in the loading game interface, which largely avoids the loss of game progress&#x2F;archive damage. </p>

<h2 id="3-Define-Actionable-Boundaries"><a href="#3-Define-Actionable-Boundaries" class="headerlink" title="3. Define Actionable Boundaries"></a>3. Define Actionable Boundaries</h2><p>Although we can use the game’s own inclusive design to accept various behaviors of players as much as possible, sometimes we still don’t want various strange operations to occur. This requires setting some boundaries to properly guide players and reduce the possibility of incorrect input.</p>
<h3 id="Clear-Definition-Instructions"><a href="#Clear-Definition-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Clear Definition Instructions"></a>Clear Definition Instructions</h3><p>We can tell players the boundaries of operation by directly writing down the rules, so that players can autonomously filter out some wrong input situations. This method is more common in the interface for entering nicknames. The rules for nicknames are often more complicated, involving character type restrictions, character length restrictions, space processing, etc., and various input situations may occur. Different games also have different requirements for nicknames. Appropriately marking some rules will make it more convenient for players to enter content that meets the requirements.</p>
<h3 id="Limited-Options"><a href="#Limited-Options" class="headerlink" title="Limited Options"></a>Limited Options</h3><p>We can limit the operation by reducing the freedom of input components and filtering out some options outside the boundary. For example, in the trading house of <em>Revelation M</em>, the value of “Purchase Quantity” requires players to enter pure numbers. When clicking on a number to enter, the system will force the numeric keyboard to pop up, avoiding the situation where players enter other characters. </p>

<h3 id="Condition-Constraints"><a href="#Condition-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Condition Constraints"></a>Condition Constraints</h3><p>Condition constraints are a commonly used design method in Metroidvania-like games. There are often some places on the map that cannot be reached in the early stage, and you need to obtain a certain ability or some props to explore. Through the gradual unlocking of various conditions, players can be guided to play according to the design expectations, enjoy the fun of constantly discovering new content, and also make the growth of the character and the rhythm of the game reach a relatively stable state.</p>
<p>At the exit of the novice map of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, this design is made. A bug is arranged to block the way. Players need to learn spell skills to pass, prompting them to return to explore other paths and improve their character abilities. It also prevents players from accidentally breaking into the late-game map in the early stage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F13c93885-15dd-4cfb-a3f5-a5709267774d.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Operation-Feedback-and-Correction"><a href="#4-Operation-Feedback-and-Correction" class="headerlink" title="4. Operation Feedback and Correction"></a>4. Operation Feedback and Correction</h2><p>Defining boundaries can only prompt players what kind of operation is appropriate to a certain extent, but players can still perform some operations outside the boundary. Therefore, when players take incorrect or risky operations, they can also give some feedback or remedial measures to help players correct their operations autonomously.</p>
<h3 id="Information-Prompts"><a href="#Information-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="Information Prompts"></a>Information Prompts</h3><p>Information prompts are a commonly used feedback method. By giving prompts and guidance after players perform interactive operations, players’ operations are further corrected. The timeliness of information feedback is very important, and it needs to be pointed out immediately when an operation occurs. <em>Hades</em> has strict requirements on the steps of operation. For example, you must collect rewards before entering the next level. If you press the button to interact with the door without completing it, the interface will display “Collect Rewards!” information feedback, and at the same time, there will be a light spot sliding to the reward item to prompt and guide the player. </p>

<h3 id="Secondary-Confirmation"><a href="#Secondary-Confirmation" class="headerlink" title="Secondary Confirmation"></a>Secondary Confirmation</h3><p>Secondary confirmation is very common in games. It generally appears after some important operation steps, prompting players to the possible results of this operation, so that players can make a more cautious judgment of their operations, and prevent possible misoperation situations. For example, when clicking exit during the <em>Devil May Cry 5</em> level, a secondary confirmation interface will pop up to ask, telling the player that if they exit at this time, they will continue from the last checkpoint when they restart, so that the player can confirm whether to return to the main menu. </p>

<h3 id="Revocable-Operations"><a href="#Revocable-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Revocable Operations"></a>Revocable Operations</h3><p>Although there is no “regret medicine” in the real world, the game world is imaginative, and anything can happen. Therefore, some games are very considerate to provide players with revocable operations, so that players can have the opportunity to make up for their mistakes after discovering them. For example, the store in <em>Revelation Online</em> has a repurchase function. After an item is sold, it will not disappear immediately, but will enter the repurchase list. If you accidentally sell the wrong thing, you can buy it back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F1bfe3517-db48-4a47-a82c-d194b5b3f059.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>Postel’s Law tells us: the game needs to have two faces, one facing the player and the other facing the machine. The face facing the player needs to be open and inclusive, allowing the existence of diverse player operations and the input of various non-standard information; while the face facing the machine should follow the specifications and be cautious to avoid errors and confusion, so as to better convey the content to the player.</p>
<p>Fault-tolerant design in games is a very important part of the game experience. The application of Postel’s Law in games can help game designers design more stable systems and more user-friendly interfaces, improve the fault tolerance of game products, and thus further enhance the player’s game experience.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230628/28584_1095683.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With social progress and technological iteration, the form of social interaction has undergone various evolutions. From offline to online, the roles, spaces, and scenes of social interaction are constantly being reconstructed. People’s desire for expression and sharing has not diminished, and the social battleground has gradually shifted online. On the one hand, mature social products are emerging one after another, and on the other hand, games have become the social medium for most modern people, becoming a virtual scene carrying social interaction and also a topic of conversation after dinner.</p>
<p>From the perspective of game production and operation, game social interaction is an old topic. According to iResearch data, among all the reasons why domestic players leave a mobile game, “weak social attributes” account for 31%, ranking first in guiding players to “abandon the game”.</p>
<p>So, why is social interaction so important in games?</p>
<p>For manufacturers, social content is different from one-time consumable content (such as new storylines). It has low production pressure and strong sustainability. Most online games rely on social interaction to maintain player investment in the later stages, and social interaction between players is also an important part of revitalizing the game ecology. For players, interacting with others in the game can bring experiences such as a sense of identity, belonging, and superiority, which is also the main pleasure in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>Social interaction in games often revolves around collaboration, competition, supply and demand, etc., and combines with appropriate relationships to form an overall social structure. For example, players of the same level use warrior, mage, and priest class combinations to achieve combat division of labor. Players of different levels establish common goals for collaboration through large organizations, or achieve hard social needs through profit sharing and resource trading.</p>
<p>In the home system, social interaction gameplay often starts from the leisure perspective of the game, and creates more entertaining social experiences without putting pressure on players. Compared with traditional social interaction, home social interaction is more “leisurely”, “loving”, and “healing”. It allows players to interact with acquaintances or strangers without pressure, and can better help players integrate into the social ecology of the virtual world. This is the current general environment, and it is also a social scene that more players will pursue in future games. Therefore, the social interaction in the home system should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In past contacts with various game players, we found that there are many types of home social gameplay. The core pleasures of players are mainly divided into the following categories: management-oriented pleasure, home construction-oriented pleasure, and pure social-oriented pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="1-Home-Resource-Exchange"><a href="#1-Home-Resource-Exchange" class="headerlink" title="1. Home Resource Exchange"></a>1. Home Resource Exchange</h2><p>Driving social interaction with transactions is the most common way, and it is no exception in the home system. Like players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> exchanging specialties for cross-island trade, and players in <em>Revelation M</em> visiting friends’ homes to find daily flower merchants to buy rare flower seeds to exchange for home coins, this “differentiation” and “scarcity” can effectively mobilize players’ enthusiasm and motivate players to visit each other’s homes.</p>
<p>Specifically, taking <em>Animal Crossing</em> as an example, many players who enjoy collecting say that social interaction (going to other people’s islands) is a “rigid need” of the game. Because players are born in the southern or northern hemisphere, they have different (seasonal limited) insects and fish in different seasons, and these two contents account for a large proportion of the game’s collection elements. Although there are seasonal changes, due to the game’s time being synchronized with reality, in order to achieve the purpose of rapid collection, players need to travel between the two hemispheres, and visiting each other has become a necessary social link in the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fc5ee95c6-4ac0-45ad-9cc2-42a50ecb331e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Animal Crossing》 Collection System - If you want to quickly collect all the illustrations, you need to visit other players’ islands to catch insects and fish</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, <em>Animal Crossing</em> also incorporates many random events, such as furniture, flower seeds, floor wallpapers randomly refreshed in the store, clothing sold in the clothing store unlocked with progress, and some random limited events such as carpet merchants and meteor showers (this type of event is an important way for players to obtain rare items). The random factors mean that visiting friends or strangers from time to time can discover new surprises, further stimulating players’ desire for this type of social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F549e5631-9e41-4128-bb94-f8dcae29a862.png/size/"></p>

Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home"></a>2. Multi-person Interaction&#x2F;Activities in the Home</h2><p>Reciprocal (helping friends water flowers, pick vegetables, etc.) and entertaining (playing the piano, dancing, playing chess, playing cards, etc.) are common multi-person interactions in the home. Furniture interactions that can create beautiful memories together and casual mini-games where you can talk and laugh together are also social needs that players have high voices for. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>《Revelation Online》 - Multi-person Band Performance</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to small interactive props or casual gameplay, many players believe that holding party activities at home is also a great tool to promote social interaction in players’ small circles. For example, players who have participated in the <em>Heartopia</em> test have said that the free party is the social interaction they prefer. From preparing food and fireworks to inviting neighbors to the house, and then interacting together after the party officially starts, and finally taking a group photo, it’s a perfect ending. It is worth mentioning that the seemingly formal party gameplay has no substantial material rewards. What players can gain is the opportunity to become friends with neighbors who come to the appointment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F91917911-4ce7-42fd-aeaf-17a2f1259781.jpg/size/" alt="Party In Heartopia"></p>

Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities"></a>3. Co-building Multi-person Homes, Multi-person Communities</h2><p>In addition to visiting each other, co-living with multiple friends, interacting and entertaining, and creating a self-world for small groups are also the home social needs of many players. Couples&#x2F;roommate players in <em>Mole’s World</em> are quite fond of the process of building a home bit by bit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F75d8ddf3-1b68-4715-93bd-c65ba3c25bb8.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Mole’s World》 - Public storage box for furniture, both parties can move their furniture into the public storage box for management and decoration</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similarly, <em>Justice Online</em>‘s multi-player manor also satisfies the “cohabitation” needs of many small group players. Even if they are on different servers from their friends, they can break the barriers between servers and gather multiple friends to build a manor together, creating a team building paradise.</p>
<p>In the community-like design of “Qiyunji”, players can think about how to plan the area of the entire manor together with their friends and conceive the overall manor style. In addition to home construction, players can also go fishing in Bixi or cooperate in treasure hunting with their close friends, interact with their friends’ pet cats and dogs, and even transform into a chef, show off their superb cooking skills, and prepare a table of delicacies for their friends. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Fe0764a49-f399-4502-a3e4-08fd27b7a339.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Justice Online》 - Everyone is fishing together in the manor</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to such acquaintance communities, homes (or rather, communities) can also become opportunities and situations for stranger social interaction.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Heartopia</em> players also mentioned that the game’s special home social mechanism brought them unexpected surprises. Because each time you enter the game, up to 12 players will be randomly assigned to the same town, and players will meet 11 different people every day. The neighbor you passed by yesterday may be replaced the next time you log in.</p>
<p>The random mechanism creates distance for players who don’t like social interaction, and also brings a special social experience to the town. Every time you log in, there will be new neighbors, and new neighbors have the opportunity to become friends. From small things like watering flowers and playing with cats for neighbors, and completing a two-person action with neighbors, to big things like holding a party and inviting neighbors in the town to visit… In the end, it may precipitate a larger and more dynamic social network. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F6459c8e3-cd67-4104-94b7-1eaffb6664b3.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes"><a href="#4-Spontaneous-Social-Interaction-Brought-by-Players-Building-Homes" class="headerlink" title="4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes"></a>4. Spontaneous Social Interaction Brought by Players Building Homes</h2><p>The home system is often accompanied by highly free construction and decoration gameplay. In addition to creating and designing their ideal beautiful homes, players are also committed to creating various fancy things by building houses, and this kind of curiosity-seeking fancy things can usually attract a large number of players and bring active spontaneous social interaction.</p>
<p>Some players in <em>Animal Crossing</em> like to try to move real scenes into the game and record important events in their lives that are ceremonial. For example, Japanese pixel artist BAN-8KU held a virtual exhibition “Kitten Exhibition”, attracting a large number of players to visit; a Twitter player named WhimsyWool moved her canceled graduation ceremony to the game, and the 18-second video instantly received 1.5 million views and 200,000 likes; many players also held weddings in Animal Crossing during the epidemic and posted them on social media, inviting netizens to witness together… </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F830719a1-00e1-4443-a9e7-a87a02ecfcb4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Animal Crossing》 - Holding art exhibitions, job fairs, graduation ceremonies, weddings</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similar social situations also appear in domestic mobile games. The master players of <em>Mole’s World</em> decorate their homes into online bathhouses, internet cafes, bars, couple cinemas, hot spring hotels, study gardens… and invite netizens to check in online. Overnight, they became internet celebrity shops, attracting many players to follow the trend and queue up to visit. Players continue to post check-in guides and experiences on Weibo, Xiaohongshu and other platforms, and <em>Mole’s World</em> has also frequently gone out of the circle on social media because of this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F84348c80-d917-4d9a-82ab-a50055b36653.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%21%5BMole%20Manor%20Internet%20Cafe%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2F8f3a1017-3f89-45c8-b85a-c7df0c57c07d.png/size/" alt="Mole Manor Bar"></p>
<p>What’s more, many players in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> buy houses to open RP shops (role play), providing various scenes for immersive role-playing, from small bars and teahouses, nightclubs and dance halls, schools and libraries, bathhouses and hotels, to large churches and museums, haunted houses and dungeon secret rooms, amusement parks and divination houses, photography studios, and even host clubs. Players’ brains are wide open, and they have played different tricks with the housing system.</p>
<p>Regarding RP shops, players can independently decorate their houses, become shop owners, hire people to play NPCs, and attract customers to consume; they can also find a favorite shop to apply for, play NPCs, and serve players who come to consume, such as providing services&#x2F;item transactions according to the menu and price list, providing chat and play services, playing musical instruments or dancing; they can also just visit and consume, or chat with NPCs or other players in the shop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230628%2Ffe9f8868-9d7f-469b-ac35-ea2b7a5690db.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《FF14》 - Theater RP &amp; Audience Appreciation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the long run, the RP shop industry chain has been derived in the game ecology. Players who want to play NPCs and players who want to contact NPCs each have their own fun, and gradually become a major feature of the game culture. In addition to promoting social interaction, RP shops have a certain stimulus for the demand for housing, furniture, and character costumes, and are also helpful to the economic cycle of the game. From this, we can also glimpse some inspiration for the commercialization of the game from the home system.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>In summary, the social interaction carried out by players through the home system and the fun obtained during the social interaction are nothing more than three kinds. One is the social interaction derived from management-oriented pleasure (stealing vegetables&#x2F;watering&#x2F;feeding&#x2F;special resource acquisition &amp; exchange, etc.), the second is the social interaction derived from home construction-oriented pleasure (display &amp; invitation to visit experience&#x2F;co-building home, etc.), and the third is pure social-oriented pleasure (social interaction in the home - interactive props&#x2F;social gameplay).</p>
<p>For the home as a social scene, most players care about whether they can simulate real life and feel the lively atmosphere of life. They regard the home as a leisure place for acquaintance social interaction, and will party, chat, dance, and hold weddings with friends in the home. At the same time, they do not exclude meeting friendly strangers through the home system and will interact. At the same time, the home is no longer limited to one person’s small home, but gradually forms a multi-person family, a community of more people, thus forming a social circle.</p>
<p>It is precisely this kind of non-mandatory and non-strong goal-oriented social interaction that makes players pay more attention to their social feelings of being cared for and valued, and it is precisely this kind of interaction that makes players actively deepen the connection between each other, and the home gradually evolves into a spiritual dwelling place in the virtual world.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the early days of video game development, audio experiences were often added to the game in the later stages of development, and were unlikely to fully meet the needs of game type, emotional content, background, etc. Today, in game development, it is often necessary to consider dimensions such as cost and player needs, but content consumption is always naturally faster than production, and game music still faces the problem of insufficient supply.</p>
<p>Game soundtracks themselves need to be adapted to the game’s level, map, and scene design. This high dependence on basic game design can lead to a problem: if the game itself does not adopt a highly differentiated and personalized design in terms of maps, scenes, characters, etc., even if the game soundtrack composers have tried to make as many changes as possible in the number of tracks and music structure design, it is still impossible to solve the problem of obvious homogeneity.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because if players stay on a specific map for a long time without exploring other maps, or if the overall map elements and general style of the game are relatively consistent, and unlike fantasy games that can accommodate many imaginative designs, what players hear is always music that is generally consistent in style. Even if there are subtle stylistic differences between different pieces of music, whether or not these differences can be heard depends largely on the player’s own level of musical aesthetic.</p>
<p>Therefore, game music often still faces the problem of high repetition, and even makes players bored and disgusted, directly muting the game.</p>
<p>So how can we explore potential solutions to this problem? This article will break down the problem from the aspects of players’ needs for music differentiation, factors affecting music perception, and music content customization, and discuss how to alleviate the problem of music repetition.</p>
<h2 id="1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation"><a href="#1-Analysis-of-Players’-Needs-for-Game-Music-Differentiation" class="headerlink" title="1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation"></a>1. Analysis of Players’ Needs for Game Music Differentiation</h2><p>Before starting the discussion, let’s briefly introduce the categories of various game music as an introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambient music</strong> (including large maps, dungeons, etc.): battle music, map music</li>
<li><strong>Functional music</strong> (instrumental performance, objects containing short musical snippets in the game, victory&#x2F;defeat music)</li>
<li><strong>Story music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cutscene music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Songs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, why do players need differentiated game music?</p>
<p>This needs to be analyzed from two levels: experience and function. From an experiential perspective, game music plays a role in creating an atmosphere, such as promoting the development of the plot climax and stimulating the player’s sense of tension in battle; in terms of functionality, game music can play a role in prompting information, such as customizing music according to the characteristics of the map, players can hear the national culture of a map from the music style, or the battle music will usually become more and more intense, thereby indicating the increase in the difficulty of the level. These are all components of immersion.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the game music is not differentiated, players will lack an auditory channel to grasp the information of the game, and will lose a certain degree of emotional investment, thus appearing to lack immersion. </p>

<h2 id="2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music"><a href="#2-What-Factors-Will-Affect-Your-Perception-of-Game-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?"></a>2. What Factors Will Affect Your Perception of Game Music?</h2><p>After understanding that players have certain needs for music differentiation, what kind of music can highlight differentiation in the perception of players? We can first look at what factors will affect players’ perception of game music.</p>
<h3 id="The-Existence-of-Music"><a href="#The-Existence-of-Music" class="headerlink" title="The Existence of Music"></a>The Existence of Music</h3><p>Past psychological studies have found that the existence of music is self-evident for the creation of immersion and emotional connection in video games. However, in this regard, the existing research results present two extremes.</p>
<p>For some players, when the music is turned off, their emotions are detached from the game, and they believe that music is crucial for masking external noise and interference. But conversely, some people have suggested that if there is no music, they can better focus on the game experience, because music is a part of the game that players cannot actually control, which will make them feel less in control. This may be because when the music is turned off, players are more likely to hear other operation-related sound effects without being distracted by the music, so that they can be more immersed in the game.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music"><a href="#Players’-Familiarity-with-the-Selected-Music" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music"></a>Players’ Familiarity with the Selected Music</h3><p>Generally speaking, players tend to choose familiar songs to get the emotions or emotional effects they want to enhance immersion. But in fact, the player’s prediction here is not necessarily correct. Because players lack experience in understanding the complex interaction between music and games, they may not be able to correctly choose the music they think can help achieve the desired effect. For example, when choosing battle music, players may tend to choose repetitive short songs, but in fact, repetitive short songs are easy to distract people, and they will make the atmosphere too tense, and even hinder the play of skills and battle strategies.</p>
<h3 id="Lyrics"><a href="#Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="Lyrics"></a>Lyrics</h3><p>Lyrics have the risk of distracting players, especially if players like the song, they will be immersed in the lyrics rather than the game. This is because players cannot ignore the familiar lyrics in the song when playing the game, and may even hum along. In addition, they will intentionally or unintentionally try to associate the lyrics with the game, which may be because most people are accustomed to watching visual effects that match the lyrics of the song, thereby establishing a connection between the visual effects and the lyrics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fe689bed0-d1f4-41a0-8103-e8cac074b9e4.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Differences-in-Music-Genres"><a href="#Differences-in-Music-Genres" class="headerlink" title="Differences in Music Genres"></a>Differences in Music Genres</h3><p>In addition, music types can also affect the gaming experience. Music that does not match the atmosphere of the corresponding scene will often increase the player’s anxiety and lead to a lack of concentration. Among them, certain music genres are more suitable for specific types of gameplay, which is also related to the historical development of the cultural connotation of music genres.</p>
<h3 id="Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design"><a href="#Players’-Expectations-for-Music-Design" class="headerlink" title="Players’ Expectations for Music Design"></a>Players’ Expectations for Music Design</h3><p>Soundtrack design is adjusted by several game parameters during runtime, such as switching according to the player’s game progress, etc. Experienced gamers are usually aware of the important role of music in reminding them of danger or providing other game information. Therefore, they will expect music to play a role in prompting battle status, actions, etc., and when this expectation is met, they will have a higher sense of immersion, otherwise they will be aware of the lack of this information and affect the overall game experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization"><a href="#3-Solving-the-Problem-of-Music-Repetition-Music-Content-Customization" class="headerlink" title="3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization"></a>3. Solving the Problem of Music Repetition - Music Content Customization</h2><p>Returning to the countermeasures for the problem of music repetition, one solution is to adopt a music content customization model. There are also many ways to customize music content, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Online improvisation:</strong> In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can improvise on the musical instruments in the game. This interactive mode adds more fun and more different possibilities to the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fdbad9544-36a1-497c-a19d-046510d6583d.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Player-composed music:</strong> The musician in <em>Revelation M</em> allows players to customize music scores to play. This model can not only satisfy players’ creative desires, but also generate music autonomously through a large player base, enriching the game’s music content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F3a4751ba-131a-4ae5-a138-da528b873130.png/size/"></p>
<p><strong>In-game custom album series:</strong> <em>GTA</em> allows players to customize in-car music, so that players can not only choose the songs they want to listen to in the game, but also upload their own playlists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fb7c21e61-66d9-4790-bea4-733d87456af9.png/size/"></p>
<p>In fact, some game companies are open to mod creation and source code release, with the aim of encouraging players to edit and share new levels or content based on the game. In order to be able to add audio to the new levels created, some players will develop mod tools and share them with other players to help them automatically write music and sound effects. For example, AudioMod in <em>Minecraft</em> allows users to add new music and sound effects to the game.</p>
<p>When Microsoft launched their Xbox 360 console in 2005, they also mandated that all games made for the Xbox 360 must allow players to customize the soundtrack, that is, when players plug in other MP3 players, the game music will be turned off and replaced by the player’s own music.</p>
<h2 id="4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game"><a href="#4-Music-Content-Customization-Enhances-Players’-Sense-of-Control-over-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game"></a>4. Music Content Customization Enhances Players’ Sense of Control over the Game</h2><p>Why can the method of music content customization solve the problem of game music homogeneity to a certain extent?</p>
<p>First, players will subconsciously and autonomously establish a connection between music and the game. No matter what happens between the current auditory and visual environment, players will connect all the presented information together to realize their in-game experience.</p>
<p>Behind this phenomenon, it is not only because music will affect the player’s perception of images, but images will also affect the perception of music. Choosing and listening to music is not regarded as a peripheral experience of gameplay. On the contrary, even music external to the game and chosen by the player will be regarded as part of the game experience. It is not only used to mask background noise or provide additional entertainment, but also to enhance the emotions generated during the game.</p>
<p>This highlights the importance of games as Gesamtkunstwerk (total art, that is, all arts are combined under a unified ideology): the game experience is not only visual effects, gameplay, or sound, but the combination of these elements to create a better experience for players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fbc4bff3c-b33c-41dc-8fca-0bd4aeefb584.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, the player’s sense of control over the game is also key. Music content customization allows them to have better control over the game environment, and this control over music content also changes their relationship with game music. Player research found that when they can choose the music they want, their state anxiety level (“state anxiety” refers to a temporary state of anxiety, rather than a longer-term personality trait), heart rate&#x2F;skin electrical response will decrease, indicating a lower level of emotional arousal. This effect is especially obvious in players who are less familiar with the game or the corresponding music.</p>
<p>But in the game, should players really be kept at a low level of anxiety? The answer is no, because the sufficient sense of anxiety provided by music can also drive players to continue to move forward in the game. For those players who pursue a more exciting sense of battle, they will prefer to experience songs that can increase anxiety. In addition, players generally expect a more dynamic emotional range when playing games, and the variability and adaptability of music play an important role in enhancing this emotional range. Therefore, the actual music design also needs to refer to the emotional experience process of players’ games and consider more.</p>
<p>In short, game music design needs to consider both players’ conscious tendencies and players’ unconscious cognitive habits. Only by combining the two can we design a soundtrack that matches the player’s game emotional process.</p>

    <title>The Magical 7 - Smooth Experience Design Under the Law of Memory</title>
    <url>/2023/06/29/netease-ux-articles/news_20230703_28584_1096587/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230703/28584_1096587.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1956, American psychologist George Miller published a paper titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” which discussed the relationship between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. The number of alternatives for one-dimensional absolute judgment hovers around 7, which is roughly equivalent to the limit of short-term memory. That is, the memory span of young people is about 7 units (Arabic numerals, letters, words, or other units). Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not absolute, and it is also related to the length, complexity, and memory proficiency of the memory unit.</p>
<p>This is Miller’s Law, which is widely respected in design.</p>
<p>Miller’s Law is one of the earliest research results on the content of short-term memory, and it is still widely applicable in design. For example, designers will consciously reduce the amount and complexity of information presented to users at the same time, actively integrate information, and adopt modular methods. These are the most basic practices of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>As a common scene of rapid thinking and short-term memory, game design should naturally conform to Miller’s Law. Next, this article will show you some design practices related to Miller’s Law in current games.</p>
<h2 id="1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden"><a href="#1-Control-the-Amount-of-Information-to-Reduce-User-Burden" class="headerlink" title="1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden"></a>1. Control the Amount of Information to Reduce User Burden</h2><p>People’s memory processing of information is limited. Usually, the more information there is, the harder it is for us to remember. This is a relatively easy-to-understand explanation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the easiest way to think of is to simply and rudely reduce the amount of information to reduce the user’s understanding burden. Facts have proved that reducing the amount of information is indeed quite effective. At present, the number of information chunks presented in people’s mobile phone software has basically not exceeded the range of “7±2”. The same is true for games.</p>
<p>But in fact, 20 years ago, Miller’s Law did not receive attention from designers in game design. MMORPG games in the early 21st century, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em>, had extremely “terrifying” skill buttons spread across the bottom of the screen. Some complex professions even had to press more than 20 skill buttons in a skill cycle! Although not all scenes need to use so many skills, the extremely complex key settings will still bring trouble to the player’s operation and memory, especially increasing the entry threshold for new players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F600fd181-6960-40ae-95e6-e03c8d6430db.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The complex skill keys in “World of Warcraft” greatly increase the difficulty of getting started</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Later, with the emergence of MOBA games such as DOTA and LOL, this problem was alleviated. Take LOL as an example. Almost all heroes only have the following commonly used keys: 4 skills + 2 summoner skills + several equipment skills (basically no more than two). This falls exactly within the “7±2” range. The practice of Miller’s Law is actually one of the reasons why MOBA games are easy to get started and popular all over the world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F08229701-ce61-41f3-b6fd-cfa7ebd739b0.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The hero skill interface of LOL is much simpler, and the number of items players need to remember is also within the “7±2” range</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the conclusion of “7±2” is not only reflected in the number of skills. RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games bring Miller’s Law into full play. As a typical multi-threaded game, RTS requires players to control the overall situation and each “chunk”. According to research, in <em>StarCraft</em>, except for some professionally trained professional players, most ordinary players can only take care of six or seven game events at the same time, which has the same effect as Miller’s Law. These include back-end resource development, advance team reconnaissance, containment, frontal force attack, defense, etc., but no matter how the player operates, it is within the scope of Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F6ae8d06d-5b91-466c-b370-cefe8f031c9b.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Not to mention other events, attack alone can be divided into single-line and multi-line, ground-to-ground and ground-to-air</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, when designing, designers will also consider the design of multi-threading more or less: too few threads will make the game too simple and lack depth; too many threads will greatly increase the difficulty of the game.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many places that reflect this “magical 7”: the number of displays in the status bar and toolbar, the menu items on the UI, the number of key NPCs in the plot… These should basically fall within the range of “7±2”, otherwise, there will be a greater risk of causing players to obtain information and memory burden.</p>
<h2 id="2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding"><a href="#2-Form-Information-Chunks-to-Assist-User-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding"></a>2. Form Information Chunks to Assist User Understanding</h2><p>Miller’s research is not only on the “number 7”, but also on the concept of chunks and our ability to process memory information.</p>
<p>I believe that everyone will encounter the problem of too many APPs when using mobile phones. Only by classifying them into groups and naming each group correctly can the mobile phone desktop look clean. In fact, this is a daily manifestation of Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>When the amount of information is indeed excessive and cannot be simply and rudely compressed, it is an excellent method to match related information to different information units to form chunks. At this time, the component block replaces a single APP as the memory unit. As long as the number of chunks does not exceed “7±2”, it can easily and effectively help users process and understand information, so that they can quickly identify the content of interest, and “expand” the user’s memory span to a certain extent.</p>
<p>In games, this method has also been widely practiced.</p>
<p>In the UI design of FPS games, the current gun information, the number of bullets, the backup gun, and the throwing object information belong to the same type of elements. They are often grouped together as a whole and displayed at the bottom left or bottom right of the screen at the same time, reducing the burden on the player’s brain: just glance in one direction to get all the relevant information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F4d468337-a631-4693-8013-cedd3deed5c3.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>A large amount of information does not appear individually, but is grouped into “chunks” and regarded as a unit</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the character information (including health, skills, mechanism values, etc.) in ACT games also has the same characteristics, so it is often put together.</p>
<p>Not only the UI, but the backpack systems of many games also reflect this “classification” wisdom. Take the classic sandbox game <em>Minecraft</em> as an example. Its backpack has a one-click sorting function. As long as the player presses the corresponding button, the items will be automatically arranged according to the category; if you want to store, the chest interface also has a classification button with similar functions. After that, when players observe the backpack interface, they are no longer looking around like “headless flies”, but looking for the category first, and then looking for the corresponding item. The difficulty of obtaining information before and after sorting the backpack is very different, which also reflects the importance of chunks in Miller’s Law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fc34eafb5-4c13-4570-b2aa-6125b3b612a7.png/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience"><a href="#3-Present-Information-Step-by-Step-to-Optimize-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience"></a>3. Present Information Step by Step to Optimize User Experience</h2><p>Another major method derived from Miller’s Law is: step-by-step design to reduce information density and optimize user experience. In fact, we are practicing the theory of distribution operations every day. Imagine what the user experience would be like if the food delivery APP put ordering, placing an order, filling in the address, and payment on the same interface? What if the mobile bank stuffed the key steps of transfer such as filling in information, obtaining a verification code, and identity confirmation all to the user? Step-by-step design has penetrated into all aspects of our daily life. Although it looks simple, its role cannot be underestimated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2Fa391b6cf-9e72-4132-bf44-5afbdb3e8221.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Step-by-step design of ordering in food delivery APP</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Game operations often encounter scenarios with particularly large amounts of information or complex business. Usually in game design, designers will first sort out the game process, and then process the corresponding information step by step, thereby reducing the impatient emotions brought to players by excessive information content in a single step, allowing players to immerse themselves in the current operation in each step.</p>
<p>The closest thing to step-by-step design in the game is the novice tutorial, because a large amount of information about the operation must be displayed to a person with no experience at all. At this time, how to achieve “clear explanation” while being “easy to understand” and “not discouraging” is the top priority of novice tutorial design.</p>
<p>At present, the novice tutorials of many games have implemented Miller’s Law.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching form, most novice tutorials break down the teaching content into small pieces, and only teach one content at a time, such as operation methods, game rules, task goals, etc., to avoid confusion for new players; in terms of the amount of content, although the types and focus of various game operations are different, the number of key teaching nodes in many novice tutorials falls exactly within the range of “7±2”. This is not a coincidence, but an imperceptible manifestation of Miller’s Law in design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F97dc54e3-fff5-4844-a55f-f6d29f2216ba.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Destiny 2”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in <em>Destiny 2</em>, although its novice tutorial lasts nearly half an hour, there are actually only a few key teaching points, many of which are already familiar to players (such as movement, jumping, use of firearms, etc.). The information density can be said to be quite low, which also reflects that <em>Destiny 2</em> is not a very hardcore FPS game. At the same time, the 8 teaching points also fall within the range of Miller’s Law “7±2”, and the overall rhythm and the player’s memory burden have been fully optimized.</p>
<p>And <em>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em> obviously also conforms to this rule: step-by-step teaching, and the number is limited to the range of “7±2”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F55ef574a-0e2f-44ec-97b4-9ec67422e76a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Main teaching points of the novice tutorial of “Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, inserting plots in the novice tutorial is not only an excellent way to introduce the game world view and explain the background, but also has the effect of reducing information density, allowing users to slowly absorb teaching knowledge and giving players time to remember and digest. This is also why many games like to use the perspective of the protagonist to advance the plot while killing enemies, and embed novice tutorials in the plot.</p>
<p>Of course, not only novice tutorials, but many puzzle game level designs also adopt step-by-step design. At this time, players will no longer advance the level linearly, but obtain information and resources in a step-by-step manner, reflecting the core of puzzle games: information acquisition and information use. And Miller’s Law solves the user experience problem during information acquisition.</p>
<p>For example, in the classic puzzle game <em>Rusty Lake: Paradise</em>, players can see many shadows of step-by-step design. From the perspective of the entire game, its plot process is divided into ten levels (that is, ten disasters), and this division optimizes the user’s plot intake experience; from the perspective of a single level, different information is placed in different small scenes, but the amount of information in each scene is very small, which is also a decrease in information density, which helps to reduce the information collection burden of players, and uses the layout of each small scene to make players form associations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230703%2F140e2074-a949-4867-8e4b-6fc11d834d22.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The smallest unit of “Rusty Lake: Paradise”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It can be seen that due to the particularity of puzzle games, the amount of information cannot be controlled within the range of “7±2”, and at this time, step-by-step design is particularly important.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The application of Miller’s Law in design is mainly to solve the user memory problem caused by information blocks. Reasonable information layout and information processing can greatly improve the user’s reading and memory of information. In game design, following Miller’s Law can control the complexity and difficulty of the game, improve the playability and user experience of the game; at the same time, it can also help new players better understand and master the game rules and gameplay.</p>
<p>Game designers can practice Miller’s Law by controlling the number and combination of game rules, interface elements, etc., designing game content step by step, and adopting interactive teaching methods, so as to create a simpler and easier-to-understand game experience, and improve the user satisfaction and reputation of the game. However, Miller’s Law should also be used flexibly, and do not misuse the “magical 7” to make unnecessary restrictions on the design. Analyzing specific situations is the best policy for design.</p>

    <title>How Can Non-Experts Master the Character Creation System</title>
    <url>/2024/07/05/netease-ux-articles/news_20230710_28584_1097806/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230710/28584_1097806.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Ten minutes to start the game, two hours to customize the face.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a widely circulated saying among players in MMORPG games.</p>
<p>In recent years, the character customization system has gradually become a standard feature of role-playing games (RPG), and many players love it. What is the charm of character creation that makes players so obsessed? The Proteus effect mentions that when individuals are given different character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits.</p>
<p>In games with social attributes, this means that when players put on a custom game avatar, they will project their good expectations of themselves onto this avatar, and because of the beautiful appearance of the avatar, their behavior will tend to move closer to the avatar, and they will also tend to be more friendly and enthusiastic in game social interactions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F59a704da-9729-4e5e-9bba-41acc4cc99c0.png/size/"></p>
<p>Nowadays, the customization function of game character images is becoming increasingly refined, allowing players to infinitely approach their ideal game image through these highly free customizations.</p>
<p>From the early days when you could only change the face shape, hairstyle, and body shape from a given number of templates, the character creation system has evolved to be able to adjust parameters such as size, position, and rotation through hundreds of fine dimensions. The degree of detail is so great. At the same time, in addition to improving freedom and sophistication to meet the ultimate pursuit of character creation experts, this customization system has also created a threshold for novice character creators.</p>
<p>On the Internet, we mostly hear the voices of “experts” and hear their needs for character creation functions, while the voices of ordinary players are often ignored. To this end, we have summarized the real feedback of ordinary players in different game character creation tests, combined with game examples, and analyzed how to improve the experience of ordinary players in a complex character creation system.</p>
<h2 id="1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems"><a href="#1-Increasingly-Powerful-Character-Creation-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems"></a>1. Increasingly Powerful Character Creation Systems</h2><p>The use of game character creation functions is roughly divided into two parts: preset selection and detailed character creation.</p>
<p>In the preset selection, you can choose your favorite style from the given options, directly use this style to enter the game, or enter detailed character creation; in detailed character creation, you can adjust the size, position, orientation, color, brightness and other parameters of each part of the face step by step. It is no exaggeration to say that there are a thousand parameter results for a thousand players, truly achieving the so-called thousand faces for a thousand people.</p>
<p>The detailed character creation of most games is divided into three major sections: shaping, makeup, and hairstyle.</p>
<p>The current facial shaping function can adjust the content that basically covers every muscle of the face. Take <em>Revelation M</em> as an example, there are as many as 36 subdivided modules in the facial shaping part alone, and each module has 4-6 parameter settings. Shaping mostly covers the face shape, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, and each part is subdivided into multiple sub-parts that can be adjusted. In the adjustment of eyebrows, in addition to large items such as eyebrow shape, eyebrow position on the face, and eyebrow distance, the position of the brow, middle brow, and brow tail are also open for custom adjustment. Moreover, <em>Revelation M</em> also features the addition of ear adjustments, where players can adjust the ear contour, angle, and sharpness. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F55affa0e-c07c-4304-af74-7cd4c45d16ce.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>The makeup system can add more personalized settings to the face on the basis of shaping, maximizing fashion and atmosphere. Makeup generally includes several core sections - eyebrow makeup, eyeliner and eyeshadow, eyelashes, colored contacts, blush, lip gloss, facial accessories, skin tone, or contouring and highlighting for the entire face. Players can customize the style, color, and concentration of the makeup in each part. In more refined games, it is even possible to adjust the local area separately to achieve color clashing and color mixing effects. It can be said that it is a one-to-one reproduction of the freedom of makeup in the real world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F92a1b7e9-c324-4073-b303-8ba04a4979b8.png/size/"></p>

<p>The complexity of the hairstyle module is obviously much simpler than the previous two. The function of this module is mainly realized through preset styles, and players can choose from a given number of hairstyles to more than ten. In some games with a high degree of freedom, players can customize the length of the hairstyle, the position of the braids, etc., and the hair color can also be adjusted through the full-color gamut color wheel, and even gradient colors can be set. Whether it is a dazzling two-dimensional or ordinary black, brown and gray, you can find your own spectrum. </p>

<h2 id="2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System"><a href="#2-Non-Expert-Players-Embarrassed-by-the-System" class="headerlink" title="2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System"></a>2. Non-Expert Players Embarrassed by the System</h2><p>After the above review, everyone will clearly find that although it is just a simple “character creation”, the content covered is very rich. Accompanying such a high degree of freedom is often a high threshold; the more customizable options there are, the more difficult it is for players to find their own direction.</p>
<p>In user research, more than one player has told us: “I will also create the face, but in the end, I use the preset or directly buy the image. I really can’t create it. I can be serious at the beginning, but I get bored later. I feel that what I create is not good-looking, so I might as well buy it.”</p>
<p>Most ordinary players will express it very kindly, “It’s my own problem, I don’t know how to create, for people who are厲害 (lì hai - awesome), high freedom is very good.” But in the actual experience, their feelings of embarrassment and helplessness, and the lack of confidence due to the frustration of character creation, are also real.</p>
<p>In detail, under the high threshold brought by high freedom, ordinary players (or non-expert character creators) may face the following dilemmas when using the custom appearance function.</p>
<p><strong>The first dilemma:</strong> The naming of each facial structure in the high-freedom character creation system is too professional, and there is a certain knowledge threshold. In a highly free character creation system, a face can be divided into dozens of components. For example, the facial contour is divided into: forehead, temples, apple cheeks, cheekbones, cheeks, upper jaw, lower jaw, jaw angle, chin, etc., which are all professional names for human facial muscle structure or makeup. Each part also has a variety of adjustment methods. Players who are not familiar with these on a daily basis will inevitably feel confused, “What is this? What is that? They are too similar.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F46f71505-699d-4f51-9455-c187a001403d.png/size/"></p>
<p>Without sufficient character creation experience, players often need to spend more time to check and try one by one to understand which area each block is in charge of. In such a high cognitive load scenario, it is also necessary to spend extra mental effort to try to get started, and the final combination effect may not be satisfactory. The joy of DIY may not be so pure.</p>
<p><strong>The second dilemma:</strong> Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament and effect. Just like people who don’t pay attention to makeup don’t know how to apply highlights and contour, or how to draw eyeliner and eyeshadow when they first learn makeup to achieve a pure and lovely or cold and domineering temperament. The same is true for novice&#x2F;entry-level players who are not character creation experts: lack of aesthetic knowledge, it will be difficult to get started.</p>
<p>For example, cuteness generally means that there should be some youthful features on the face, such as a short face, large eyes, a smaller proportion of the upper court, and a relatively full expression of soft tissues; purity requires a certain bluntness of the five senses. If there are more acute angles in the five senses, the feeling of shrewdness is more prominent, and it is not easy to show a pure temperament. Players without this basic knowledge of facial aesthetics will find it difficult to land the temperament they prefer in their hearts on the design (character creation) of specific parts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F26010507-2caf-4f7b-897d-4d98536d38c4.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Facial aesthetic standards of three courts and five eyes</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The third dilemma:</strong> Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the parts they create is far from the target face. Based on the experience of looking at faces before, players will have their own preferences for the specific appearance of some facial features, but the overall aesthetic control of the face is relatively vague. When players painstakingly adjust each one for a long time, and finally create the desired oval face, smiling eyes, and sexy lips, they find that although each part is roughly what they want and looks good, the whole face is not coordinated and beautiful enough. At this time, to modify, they will issue painful entanglements of “I don’t know where to start”, “What changes can make the face harmonious and distinctive”, and “Do I still want to enter the game”.</p>
<h2 id="3-“New-Needs”-of-Ordinary-Players-Under-High-Freedom-Design"><a href="#3-“New-Needs”-of-Ordinary-Players-Under-High-Freedom-Design" class="headerlink" title="3. “New Needs” of Ordinary Players Under High-Freedom Design"></a>3. “New Needs” of Ordinary Players Under High-Freedom Design</h2><p>In view of the various difficulties encountered by non-expert players when experiencing the character creation system, many game developers have noticed this and designed a series of solutions to reduce the operational and knowledge barriers, allowing players to enjoy the joy of a thousand faces. When it comes to the specific character creation system settings, the solutions can be divided into the following types of functions.</p>
<h3 id="Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level"><a href="#Type-1-Divide-into-simple-and-expert-modes-so-that-players-of-different-expertise-levels-can-find-the-operating-freedom-that-suits-their-level" class="headerlink" title="Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level."></a>Type 1: Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level.</h3><p>Generally speaking, the section division in the simple mode is more general, and there will be fewer adjustable parameters, which is suitable for players who pursue the overall effect but do not like to抠细节 (kōu xì jié - fuss over details); the expert mode has a more detailed division and more adjustable parameters, which is suitable for character creation professionals who pursue high precision. Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. In the simple mode, you only need to select the sample and overall parameter adjustment for the face and facial features, while the expert mode can adjust the parameters of each subdivided area of the facial features, including displacement, rotation, and zoom. Players can freely switch between the two modes to meet different application scenarios, which is more flexible. </p>

<li><strong>Prepare several preset faces, preset eye shapes, eyebrow shapes, lip shapes, etc.</strong> Players can create exquisite faces just by combining various templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>New Fantasy Zhu Xian</em> as an example. When entering the character creation system, players can choose from nearly ten preset faces with different facial features and hairstyles. After selecting the preset face, they can also choose from more than a dozen facial styles with different facial features and temperaments. This choice can help players quickly locate the overall effect they want. In <em>Life Makeover</em>, not only are there preset faces for players to choose from, but each facial feature and makeup section also has a large number of preset styles to choose from. Players can even obtain an exquisite face without making any parameter adjustments, just by combining various facial feature styles. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Random character creation</strong>, you can directly choose the one you like the most among a large number of randomly generated appearances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Life Makeover</em> as an example. Players can use the random function to choose from a large number of appearances, and pick the one that surprises them the most among these “blind boxes”. However, the randomly generated results of some games may have uneven quality, and players may need to spend more time if they want to get a satisfactory appearance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fffd16876-b55c-4e16-8b9f-6c2aa41f9aa6.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Character creation sharing hall or character creation code</strong>, players can directly quote popular face templates in the in-game sharing hall, or obtain a sharing code on the external sharing platform for one-click import.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> as an example. If players do not want to create their own faces, they can also directly enter the “Master Character Creation” sharing hall, where players can choose works that match their aesthetics according to body type and temperament labels, and import them with one click. If you want to copy a high-value face on the external social platform of the game, you can also import it with one click through the character creation sharing code, eliminating the trouble of step-by-step fine-tuning according to the tutorial, which is a lazy person’s happiness code. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Temperament concept character creation</strong>, players can choose the desired temperament effect through the wheel, and the system will automatically adjust the facial structure to present it in a direction that matches the temperament type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, players can move between the four temperament dimensions of “immortal”, “childish”, “gentle”, and “fierce” through the temperament wheel. This intuitive change in the concept of temperament can quickly help players determine what kind of face they want. When you want a pure and childish little junior sister face, you only need to drag the wheel to move in the direction of “childish” to roughly achieve it. </p>

At the same time, some games will also have built-in functions to restore the initial and reset the current part (such as <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>), so that players can directly reset a part of the area or the whole with one click when they are not satisfied, and clear and restart at any time. In addition, some games also have the functions of “import” and “export”. For example, in <em>Life Makeover</em>, players can export each step of the operation in real time, and then import and read the file with one click for “repentance” or to restart at any time after interrupting the character creation. </p>

<li><strong>Photo character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Through photo intelligent character creation, the system can read the pictures of the player himself, celebrities, or even two-dimensional characters, and quickly produce a similar face in a few seconds. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, you only need to upload a photo, and the system can generate a character image with a hairstyle and makeup that matches the photo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2aa2f7a4-7c13-474a-8caf-f8ddf93ab605.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time AR expression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In some games equipped with AR scanning, players only need to turn on the camera, and the character’s expression will change in real time according to the player, such as smiling or squinting, and every frown and smile will move with the player.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text character creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The text character creation function of <em>Justice Online Mobile</em> makes game character creation easier. Players only need to spend a few seconds to enter some adjectives or the names of celebrities. With the support of AI’s black technology, they only need 1 second of cloud computing to turn the fantasy in the player’s mind or the image of their favorite celebrity into real character creation data in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, players can even enter more abstract verses. For example, directly enter “云想衣裳花想容，春风拂槛露华浓” (yún xiǎng yī shang huā xiǎng róng, chūn fēng fú kǎn lù huá nóng), and the player will get the prototype of Yang Guifei. If you really can’t think of descriptive text, there is also a random text function. Click random to generate the corresponding character image according to a large number of verses, truly realizing lazy character creation in one step. </p>

<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>The character image customization function in RPG games is gradually becoming more and more powerful, but high freedom is often accompanied by high thresholds, which brings a series of experience difficulties to non-expert players:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many and specialized muscle&#x2F;makeup names have a certain knowledge threshold;</li>
<li>Players lack basic knowledge of facial aesthetics and do not know what kind of operations can achieve the desired temperament effect;</li>
<li>Ordinary players have insufficient ability to control the overall beauty of the face, and the combination of the created parts is far from the target face.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the difficulties encountered by non-expert players in the user research conclusions, game developers have taken some measures to reduce the operational and knowledge barriers, so that they can also enjoy the joy of character creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide into simple and expert modes, so that players of different expertise levels can find the operating freedom that suits their level;</li>
<li>Provide a large number of optional templates to help players locate the desired overall effect. For example, provide preset faces and preset part styles; random character creation, character creation sharing hall, or character creation code import; temperament concept character creation, etc.</li>
<li>Set the functions of reset, undo, restore, and save to reduce the cost of trial and error for players.</li>
<li>With the assistance of AI technology, help players complete the visualization and specific operations of concepts into pictures, and create the target face they want in one step. For example, photo character creation, AR expressions, text character creation, etc.</li>

    <title>Following Intuition Mobile Game Gesture Design to Create Invisible Interactions</title>
    <url>/2023/07/07/netease-ux-articles/news_20230710_28584_1097837/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230710/28584_1097837.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most mobile game interactions rely on the UI interface. However, there are some operations that do not rely on the UI, which are pure gesture interactions, namely, moving, zooming, and rotating. In the presence of UI, the player’s behavior path is generally: “See UI control - Generate operation expectation based on the control - Make corresponding operation - Verify through feedback”. However, in the absence of UI cues, players directly generate expectations, and all operations are performed based on the player’s experience and intuition.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can summarize the indicators for evaluating gesture interaction into 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> The gesture operations that players try to perform by intuition can help them achieve their goals, and use the most concise operation flow.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable:</strong> The operation result is controllable and in line with expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback prompts after the operation are used to prompt the player whether the operation is correct or whether the operation is in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article will introduce these 3 evaluation indicators and elaborate on them with practical development experience and specific application examples.</p>
<h2 id="1-Intuitive-Design-in-Games"><a href="#1-Intuitive-Design-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Intuitive Design in Games"></a>1. Intuitive Design in Games</h2><p>The habitual gestures for mobile game players are actually very simple, nothing more than single-finger dragging and double-finger zooming. But in the actual development process, we found that there is still much to learn.</p>
<h3 id="If-a-Goal-Can-Be-Achieved-in-One-Step-Do-Not-Divide-it-into-Two-Steps"><a href="#If-a-Goal-Can-Be-Achieved-in-One-Step-Do-Not-Divide-it-into-Two-Steps" class="headerlink" title="If a Goal Can Be Achieved in One Step, Do Not Divide it into Two Steps"></a>If a Goal Can Be Achieved in One Step, Do Not Divide it into Two Steps</h3><p>Zooming and dragging correspond to two different operations. But by comparing some common apps, we can find that if the player can drag while zooming, or even rotate, it will be much smoother than zooming first and then dragging, and it is more in line with the player’s expectations. The Android Material Design specification also mentions this. The first figure below shows the scenario where double fingers only support zoom operations. It can be seen that the finger touch points do not match the screen, giving a feeling of lag. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fe2fb89d4-c1cc-4027-a943-58a4e857aeef.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Material Design - Demonstrates a Situation Where Multiple Gesture Operations Cannot Be Supported Simultaneously</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the map zoom process of the mobile game <em>Knives Out</em>, we can see that players can determine the axis they want to zoom through two fingers, which can help players confirm the position they want to zoom in one step. However, because they cannot drag while zooming, they cannot drag the position to the visual center, so there is still a slight lag. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fa71c0362-da07-49d5-89fc-1b4204c44c03.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 In-Game Map</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The reason for this feeling is that when players zoom in on the map to view, they usually have a clear target point. At this time, if the player is required to first zoom based on the center of the screen and then drag, this clear target point will deviate from the player’s visual center, or even go off-screen.</p>
<p>However, in map software, players can use two fingers to complete dragging and moving operations at the same time. Therefore, we can see that if you want to zoom out and push away the “Shidai Elevated Road” in the picture, you only need to perform one operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fc5771e6d-d9cc-485e-b34d-17d3744c72c4.gif/size/"></p>

<p>The Material Design specification also mentions this. In the figure below, the user can simultaneously perform dragging and rotating operations during the two-finger dragging process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F47235fa3-f50b-4960-adf3-174c54ebd5a4.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>Material Design - Two Fingers Can Simultaneously Zoom, Drag, and Rotate</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The map system of the iOS photo album function implements this principle. Players can simultaneously complete dragging, zooming, and rotating in one two-finger operation. The operation process is very smooth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F4c955de9-a288-42d8-9f39-0390106c4fe2.gif/size/"></p>

How should we choose when these two operations conflict?</p>
<p>Analyzing the drawing behavior, in this scenario, the most frequently used operation by players is single-finger smearing, while dragging the canvas is only an auxiliary means to better smear, and dragging can be performed simultaneously with two-finger zooming. Therefore, in this case, we can consider letting the single-finger dragging function give way to smearing, and dragging is realized through the offset of two fingers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fd087fa83-79af-4b3f-a9b2-9c27c344718a.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="2-Predictable-Operation-Results"><a href="#2-Predictable-Operation-Results" class="headerlink" title="2. Predictable Operation Results"></a>2. Predictable Operation Results</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, players have psychological expectations when performing gesture operations. This expectation is not only a mapping relationship such as two fingers corresponding to zooming and one finger corresponding to dragging, but also means that players need to be able to accurately and efficiently complete their goals during the operation process. Generally speaking, the sensitivity of the response greatly affects this point. High sensitivity will be relatively more efficient; low sensitivity will be more precise. How do we balance this?</p>
<h3 id="Sensitivity-Adjustment-There-are-Demands-for-Both-“Follow-Hand”-and-“Not-Follow-Hand”"><a href="#Sensitivity-Adjustment-There-are-Demands-for-Both-“Follow-Hand”-and-“Not-Follow-Hand”" class="headerlink" title="Sensitivity Adjustment: There are Demands for Both “Follow-Hand” and “Not Follow-Hand”"></a>Sensitivity Adjustment: There are Demands for Both “Follow-Hand” and “Not Follow-Hand”</h3><p>Here, “follow-hand” means that when the player starts a gesture operation, the position where the finger touches the operation object is the same as the position when the operation ends. On the map, it means: when starting to zoom in on the map, the thumb is at point A and the index finger is at point B, and the same is true after zooming in on the map.</p>
<p>Material Design mentions that “follow-hand” interaction is the most intuitive interaction. Comparing the following two figures, the first one is obviously much more comfortable than the second one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2db87960-d1ad-4c4e-bdd6-3df7e9a0d5ed.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>Material Design - Non-Follow-Hand Dragging</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We can also see this difference in the operation of common sliding lists.</p>
<p>When dragging slowly, the sliding list is “follow-hand”, which is convenient for users to locate the position they want. When the user swipes quickly, the list is usually swiped quickly, allowing the user to efficiently operate the long list in a short time.</p>
<p>In the first figure below, it is the case of slow dragging, and the movement of the list is “follow-hand”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F8906328c-ce9a-4d17-b1cf-84fc454293ae.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Douban - Movie List - Slow Dragging</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The second one is a quick swipe, especially in this horizontal layout, the content that can be displayed on one screen is limited, and swiping allows users to quickly move the list. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F18041567-4124-40b4-b156-653ff1fe9aab.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Douban - Movie List - Swiping</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This sliding operation is very common, for example, in the BP list of <em>Knives Out</em>, “follow-hand” dragging allows players to perform back-and-forth dragging operations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F854f50c2-eb45-4e79-8ea2-cd7f1c1bffa3.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Knives Out》 BP</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is also an application of a special scenario: the sensitivity is very low, and the movement of the content on the interface will be very slow, behaving as if it is resisting the user’s operation. Usually, this situation will make people feel laggy, but there are also very practical application scenarios:</p>
<p>For example, many applications can enter a new interface or trigger a refresh page after pulling down a certain distance on the home page. This stickiness during dragging can remind the user that there will be different changes on the interface, which is equivalent to a double confirmation, helping the user not to perform unnecessary misoperations. The trigger page on the home page of the shopping app is such an example, the further you slide down, the slower it becomes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Febccab47-efce-446b-9646-917fba623538.gif/size/"></p>

</tbody></table>
<p>For example, in single-finger rotation operations, we found slight feel differences. Sensitivity needs to be adjusted for the demand, and that often means higher sensitivity. The below picture’s rotation would be reasonably fast, even with only a half screen distance. </p>

<h2 id="3-Give-Players-Timely-Feedback"><a href="#3-Give-Players-Timely-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="3. Give Players Timely Feedback"></a>3. Give Players Timely Feedback</h2><p>Giving players feedback during gesture operations can clearly inform the player of the operation status.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to focus on vibration feedback. As a form of expression outside the interface, vibration feedback can not only remind the player of the operation status, but also enhance the sense of immersion. For example, on the Chrome home page, you can trigger 3 functions by swiping down, and you can switch functions by dragging left and right during the sliding process. How do you let the player know that they have dragged in place and can let go? In addition to the water drop-like animation performance on the interface, Chrome also adds a slight vibration prompt to inform the player of this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fd32573b9-4cee-444d-b330-f8fc1d6ef91e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Chrome Browser Home Page Pulls Down to Switch Between 3 Functions</em></p>
<hr>
<p>iPhone has a powerful Taptic Engine, which can define a variety of vibration intensities to meet different usage scenarios. For example, in the game <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players will trigger a weak vibration when clicking on interactive objects, and if the flight energy is insufficient, it will trigger a stronger vibration prompt together with the UI animation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F241d5335-b00d-4bd5-a9c8-755a9cf122aa.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Sky: Children of the Light》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is also such vibration feedback in Rayark’s ARPG mobile game <em>Implosion</em>. When the player’s armor is damaged, the mobile phone emits two-stage vibrations, together with screen shaking and special effects for strong prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fc27e3039-9617-4602-a848-88460b6a3e56.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Implosion》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After the armor is broken, the loss of health is changed to a lighter one-stage vibration, and the screen shaking is also weakened. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F0acd61ae-2692-4fa7-9a5c-4946a21bafc1.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many mobile phones do not have such a powerful vibration intensity customization function, and the vibrations are relatively simple, so they are not very suitable for diversified application scenarios, and it is also difficult to provide players with a deeper sense of immersion in touch. Vibration feedback cannot yet be used as a universal form of feedback, and we rarely see its large-scale use in mobile games.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>The important thing about gesture interaction design is to follow the player’s inner thoughts and give the player feedback on whether the operation is successful or not, giving the player a “sense of certainty” in the absence of a UI interface. A slight deviation between gesture design and intuition will cause a strange feel, so it is not enough to just talk about it on paper. It is necessary to constantly compare and adjust on real devices during the development process to achieve the smoothest gesture interaction.</p>

<h2 id="1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization"><a href="#1-The-Necessity-of-Game-Localization" class="headerlink" title="1. The Necessity of Game Localization"></a>1. The Necessity of Game Localization</h2><p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is one of the most active and growing game markets in the world in recent years. More and more developers are adopting different strategies to localize their video games into Arabic, undoubtedly seeing the huge growth potential here.</p>
<p>The localization of a game, especially in markets with good demand fit, a large player base, and weak English proficiency, can have a huge impact. According to statistics, the sales of <em>Gremlins, Inc.</em> increased eightfold within just three months of the release of the Simplified Chinese version, and it became the best-selling language version of the game, accounting for 31% of total sales. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fb55812ae-12f0-49b4-8674-f1558151a259.png/size/" alt="Gremlins, Inc. Sales Data"></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Under such market appeal, many production teams will choose to test the waters first and localize part of the game content into Arabic. A more common approach is to start with dubbing, using standard language or dialects for dubbing or subtitles.</p>
<p>However, in the absence of specific research on local player needs and localization expectations, blind action may have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s <em>The Division 2</em> (2019) had a failed dubbing attempt. The game used the Syrian dialect for voice-overs and cutscenes. After Ubisoft released the game trailer, the Arab gaming community expressed dissatisfaction with the Syrian dialect in the game, which forced Ubisoft to change the game language to Modern Standard Arabic. This choice not only cost Ubisoft extra money to re-localize, but also increased the additional time cost.</p>
<p>When deciding to make a localized version, developers will weigh factors such as time, cost, and expectations for the target market. These factors determine the strategy to start the game localization and which game content will be localized into the target language. The currently existing game localization strategies can be divided into four main categories: zero localization, printed materials, partial localization, and full localization.</p>
<p>For example, for some immersive RPG games, especially when the screen contains important interactive elements, it is helpful to partially localize the subtitles for players who do not understand the source language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F5000ad2f-616e-44a0-9c21-3e7b0e55ddfc.png/size/" alt="The Witcher 3 Arabic Dialogue"></p>

Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market"></a>2. Existing Localization Strategies in the Middle East Market</h2><p>When it comes to selling games in the target market, video games with zero localization dominate the Arab market because manufacturers believe that Arabic-speaking players who can speak English will buy games in the source language, so they can get some extra sales without investing in the localization process.</p>
<p>For example, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (2018) and <em>NBA2K20</em> (2019), which are popular in the Middle East, the lack of this translation has paved the way for the emergence of Arabic fan localization. Fans in the Middle East translate their favorite games accordingly or provide guides with Arabic commentary or subtitles on YouTube. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2Fccbe643b-2142-45aa-a8b1-ef44687bd471.png/size/" alt="Red Dead Redemption Arabic Guide on Youtube"></p>

<p>In the mid-1990s, packaging and manual localization prevailed in the Arab game market. This part of the localization requires translating a game’s packaging and player’s manual. This level of localization is defined as “market-driven localization”, which also includes the localization of the game’s e-store introduction, website, and installation wizard. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F13b4de80-debe-440a-8f97-b69ad2c80ad9.png/size/" alt="FIFA 1995 Arabic Packaging and Manual"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Arabic Packaging and Manual of FIFA 1995</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In-game localization strategies also include partial and full localization. Partial localization includes providing translations of in-game text, such as user interface (UI), and subtitles for animations and audio. Full localization involves localizing all game content into the target language, including translating packaging, manuals, and user interfaces, as well as dubbing audio files and illustrations. The following figure counts the number of games (142 in total) that have been localized into Arabic using different strategies between 2005 and 2020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F2c3d9454-5ad7-4066-a1b7-0498e4834c83.png/size/" alt="Number of Games Localized into Arabic 2005-2020"></p>

<p><em>Number of Games Localized into Arabic from 2005 to 2020</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at some examples of Arabic products that use various localization strategies and the different effects they bring.</p>
<h3 id="User-Interface-and-Subtitles"><a href="#User-Interface-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="User Interface and Subtitles"></a>User Interface and Subtitles</h3><p>The core of partial localization lies in localizing the in-game text and converting the subtitles of voice-overs and cutscenes into the target language. Most companies that want to release games in the Arab region adopt this partial localization. Successful examples include <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015), <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> (2016), <em>Resident Evil 7</em> (2017), <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> (2018), <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> (2019), and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> (2020) - all of which have been well received by Arab players. According to data surveys, about 48% of these games use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F95963434-8546-4857-a4fa-15128be3cd4a.png/size/" alt="Rise of the Tomb Raider Arabic Version"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Rise of the Tomb Raider》 Arabic Version</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, due to the particularity of Arabic, excessively long subtitles will affect the playability of the game and have a negative impact on the immersion of the game. In this case, instead of enjoying the graphics and gameplay, players may spend more time reading the subtitles. In this regard, including low-quality subtitles may have a negative impact on players’ understanding and overall gaming experience. Due to the lack of experience and historical case studies on Arabic subtitles, there is a lack of reference templates and experience for Arabic subtitles in games, which makes it difficult for game companies and localizers to adjust the game during the actual operation.</p>
<p>The Arabic subtitles in <em>The Witcher 3</em> (2015) used MSA to localize into Arabic; however, the excessively small font size and long subtitles to fit the screen have adversely affected the intelligibility of the game and the introduction of the entire storyline. Some subtitles in the game contain 8 sentences and strings of more than 200 characters, which is quite lengthy. So, the tenacious Arabic players, in order to continue playing the game, began to make their own comfortable-looking font replacement Mods and shared them on online forums. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>Some games only provide localization services for the user interface. This approach only involves minimal localization so that players who do not speak the game’s source language can launch the game and customize the settings according to their preferences. Games that adopt this localization strategy include <em>Goat Simulator</em> (2014) and <em>Squad</em> (2015). Manufacturers may usually adopt this method in order to compress the localization budget and improve the release efficiency, mainly to test the acceptance of the game in specific regions, without investing a lot of money and additional development time in a more in-depth localization process.</p>
<p>There are also some situations where the game code itself does not support providing subtitles for dialogues; the game itself does not rely on dialogues to build the game experience, etc. For example, <em>The Bridge</em> (2013) and <em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em> (2019) can both be played smoothly in Arabic at this level of localization. In this case, Arabic players can access all linguistic content (in-game text, such as menus and instructions) in Arabic. </p>

<h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>The practice of localizing only subtitles is not uncommon in the Arab video game market - only providing subtitles for the game’s voice-overs and cutscenes, that is, without localizing the user interface or in-game text. It is often used in games that rely heavily on dialogue, such as <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2014, 2015, 2017) and <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> (2016).</p>
<p>However, in some cases, technical issues in the game code or game engine prevent developers from providing Arabic localization with subtitles. Ubisoft Middle East localization director Malek Teffaha also said: “[Subtitles] are a matter of budget and game engine limitations. In our engine, support for Arabic text direction and fonts is not yet complete.” When designing games, consideration should be given to localizing the interface into other languages; developers should be prepared to handle game code in different languages from the beginning.</p>
<p>Localization is often an aspect that is easily overlooked during the game development process, and the development team may also lack knowledge of certain language characteristics, so they develop a game code whose interface may not fully support them.</p>
<p>For players who do not understand the game’s source language, the ‘subtitles only’ approach is problematic. For example, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em> lacks localized instructions and in-game ‘tips’. The following figure is taken from the loading screen of <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>. Along the bottom of the screen, the game writes a tip for players: “If you forget how to use something in the game, you can use the Know-It-All app to get some tips and tricks at any time.” However, many Arabic players cannot get useful information through this prompt due to language barriers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230710%2F07a4802a-86b9-4c2f-b60f-2ade91ac9bb8.png/size/" alt="Watch Dogs 2 Loading Screen"></p>

<p>The upper left corner of the figure below shows instructions on how to play the game (the function of the joystick buttons), explaining how to open the equipment wheel’ or ‘how to sprint’. These actions are crucial to the gameplay, and players who cannot read the source language can only learn these through constant trial and error. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Between 2005 and 2020, 142 games have been localized into Arabic. Before 2000, localized games were not common. However, with the surge in the number of Arab gamers, major manufacturers have realized the huge potential of this market in the past 15 years and have begun to increase the number of Arabic localized games.</p>
<p>Choosing the level of full localization requires a lot of technical and working time, so the cost is high and time-consuming. Therefore, products usually adopt different levels of localization strategies to find a cost-effective localization route that is suitable for their own product characteristics, skillfully allowing players to understand and smoothly experience the game, thereby opening a window to overseas target users.</p>

    <title>How to Find the Right Rhythm for Game Updates</title>
    <url>/2023/07/11/netease-ux-articles/news_20230712_28584_1098334/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230712/28584_1098334.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Game updates are a topic of concern for both developers and players, and a headache for both.</p>
<p>Facing bugs, constantly adjusting operational plans, and the speed at which players consume game content, in addition to normal version scheduling, developers sometimes have to make many updates to the game; while players are actually very conflicted, on the one hand, they hate bugs and expect the game to provide more new modes, new heroes, new skins and other freshness, but when they open the game and face the “update” button that often amounts to several GB and the new version that needs to be adapted to, they feel a little irritable, “I just want to start a game quickly as usual.”</p>
<p>What is a good update frequency? Are AAA games that keep patching responsible or irresponsible to players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fb402fd13-e67e-4c32-a308-ae8af7b391d3.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many players have a headache every time they see a game that needs to be updated</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-Are-More-Frequent-Game-Updates-Better"><a href="#1-Are-More-Frequent-Game-Updates-Better" class="headerlink" title="1. Are More Frequent Game Updates Better?"></a>1. Are More Frequent Game Updates Better?</h2><p>Are more frequent game updates better? First of all, let’s get straight to the point: obviously not.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that players may not be able to keep up with the game’s update rhythm. For example, some MMORPGs make a major update every six months, introducing new levels. In this case, equipment from six months ago may be greatly devalued in six months. The advantage of this update is that it will give many players new motivation to make equipment and give many active players something to do; but for some players, this is a burden, because once they don’t play for a season, or for a new player who has just entered the game, it is difficult for them to catch up with the main group again.</p>
<p>In addition to such major updates, for some games, there may be some additional new content every two weeks. Game developers will attract you to go online within each update cycle and complete various tasks in a relatively short period of time, otherwise you will miss many event&#x2F;task rewards.</p>
<p>In addition, for some competitive games, too frequent updates will make the player’s learning cost rise sharply. If <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s combos are adjusted every month, it will be disastrous for the player’s experience. Because action games are very different from FPS or MOBA, there are combination combos in the game, as well as the combination of various movement techniques, and so on. These things require players to spend a lot of time learning in the training ground, so if we constantly update the habits of combos, then players need to constantly learn new techniques. If the “special skill” that has been practiced after spending a lot of time is just mastered and is weakened or directly unusable, it will only accelerate the loss of players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F0ed52437-397e-4e98-8116-1a463fa6018b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》’s new map design took a year</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, from the perspective of game developers, launching a new map, hero, or weapon requires a lot of manpower and time costs. For example, players often mention “wanting a new map”, but map design is often the most complex element in the game development process. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> launched a new map on its anniversary, which took about a year; while successful battle royale games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>PUBG</em> also take at least a year to launch a new map.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Find-the-Optimal-Solution-for-Update-Frequency"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-the-Optimal-Solution-for-Update-Frequency" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find the Optimal Solution for Update Frequency"></a>2. How to Find the Optimal Solution for Update Frequency</h2><p>If we want to find the potential optimal solution for the update frequency, then we must first understand the several ways of updating the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Event-based update:</strong> <em>DOTA2</em>, etc. This kind of game is often updated with major events as the node. Whether it is a major update or a minor update, it will try to avoid conflicts with the competition.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Season update system:</strong> <em>Apex Legends</em>, etc. Based on the season, each season will launch new BP, new heroes, and other times are just repairs and patches, without major changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Short-frequency update:</strong> <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, <em>Justice Online</em>, etc. Although these games are also divided into seasons, there will be new content online every 1~2 weeks. Relatively speaking, the frequency is relatively fixed, which is Thursday of a certain week.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Completely random update mode:</strong> Games like <em>CSGO</em>, the update is completely without any signs. For example, it was recently announced that <em>CS2</em> would be launched, and there was almost no sign before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F82d852ba-a1f9-4337-8e4d-a42a19446635.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《CS2》 is quietly going online</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After understanding the update mode, we can come to a rough conclusion: there is no best update rhythm, only the most suitable (for a certain game) update rhythm.</p>
<p>Each of the games mentioned above is an industry benchmark with a leading number of online users, and they have each chosen different update paths. For example, <em>CSGO</em>, this is a game that extremely relies on the muscle memory operation of “recoil control”, so they can’t always make drastic changes. Even when developers want to weaken or strengthen a gun, they do more to balance it by changing the price of the gun, changing the magazine capacity of the gun, and never always changing the trajectory of the gun. Games like <em>Apex Legends</em> that have more elements of Hero Shooters, plus its battle royale elements, is not like traditional shooters. It needs more maps, more heroes and other new elements to give players a sense of freshness and retain players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fec20fff2-eb01-4856-bc1c-fb93c0d2e6b1.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The hero launched in the new season of 《Apex Legends》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, the unique attributes of games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>DOTA2</em> make it difficult for the game to achieve perfect balance. Even if “perfect balance” can be achieved in the early stage of the new version release, as time goes by, a super-large online game will eventually evolve more optimal solutions. They all start to adopt the same strategy, such as players choosing fixed heroes and fixed guns, which makes ordinary games or competitions boring, because many of the choices in the game are the same, then the only solution is to release updates to rebalance and change the existing optimal solution.</p>
<p>So, among so many game updates, how should the development team try to find this optimal solution and balance?</p>
<p>If the priority order of version updates is discussed from the perspective of the manufacturer, the first thing to consider is the urgency of the update points, such as major bugs with a large impact range or a deep impact. Let alone being arranged in the planned version update, some games sometimes even decide to use emergency updates to solve such problems; in addition to bugs, obvious experience problems mentioned by a relatively high proportion of players will generally increase in urgency and be placed in the most recent update.</p>
<p>Secondly, the depth of the impact of the problems presented by the game content is a reason for updates that the development team will refer to. For example, if the current consumption speed of game content is much slower or faster than originally planned, and the impact on all players, especially high-active users, is very deep, it is necessary to schedule high-priority updates. For another example, a certain piece of paid equipment does not meet the expectations of many players after it is installed, or its numerical bonus has a strong suppression effect on specific characters in PVP gameplay. Problems like this that have a large negative impact on a certain type of player group, such as paying players&#x2F;PVP players, should also be adjusted in the most recent update.</p>
<p>Of course, the above mentioned are just examples of factors that affect the update priority and update frequency. In the process of game project operation, there will still be many other modules that need to be considered. The development team should be with users at all times based on the characteristics of their own games, and combine information from the game’s own state, development schedule plan, and player feedback to continuously explore a more suitable update rhythm for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="3-Updates-for-Single-Player-Games"><a href="#3-Updates-for-Single-Player-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Updates for Single-Player Games"></a>3. Updates for Single-Player Games</h2><p>It is not only online games that have update problems, but the patches after the release of single-player games have become a hot topic among game players. In some recent games, many game developers and publishers have released “unfinished” games. For example, <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, which was just released at the end of last month, many players have had the honor of becoming “victims of the genuine game”, because the optimization of this game is really bad, and the player’s comments also reflect this. Many negative reviews are complaining about the optimization of the game, and even the popular IP of Star Wars can’t stop it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F0a12e4c9-8480-477e-afee-5766c250c5d9.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Some players think that the optimization of 《Star Wars Jedi: Survivor》 is not good</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, this is definitely not an isolated case. <em>The Last of Us</em>, released in March, is a game ported from PS to PC. A game released 10 years ago still has many optimization problems after being ported to PC, and it has been criticized. <em>FORSPOKEN</em>, which was released at the beginning of the year, has been released for 4 months now, and the optimization problem has not been solved yet. The 4090 graphics card will still drop frames and crash wildly in the game.</p>
<p>These are also masterpieces launched by the most well-known game manufacturers, Square Enix, Naughty Dog, and EA’s Respawn Entertainment, all of which are the top developers in the game industry. This makes some players curious, what happened to some AAA games now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F69d8c164-9845-42f5-8dc5-c0b4be3d266a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many of the flagship works of major manufacturers are also semi-finished products with poor optimization</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The way these big manufacturers solve optimization problems is also simple: patching. This goes back to the topic of “victims of genuine games” mentioned earlier. Some game developers are forced to launch games at a specific time within a limited budget and development time. For some optimization problems of the game, they decide to fix them all later. This seems to be an obvious “scam” in the eyes of some people, and it is difficult to be recognized by players. At least from the perspective of experience, it is very bad. Some players complain that this is equivalent to “paying full price at the beginning for a half-court game.”</p>
<p>Games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are also perfect examples. When it was first released, the content was very different from the promotional video, but the developer CDPR slowly filled in some of the content that was originally planned to be launched in the game. Now, although this game has saved a lot of reputation by relying on post-remediation, IP comics, etc., there are still some players who express their views and concerns about this phenomenon in forums and player communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F09652512-16f7-4e7a-a105-2d525c14be4a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Cyberpunk 2077》 is still trying to fix bugs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They will say, “Now there are too many game companies that sell incomplete games to players. Then there are patches on day 1, day 3, day 7… So many patches make the release of new games a death march. Planners and publishers make ridiculous decisions because they choose to fix it after release, ignoring the player experience.”</p>
<p>In fact, the feelings of these players should be understood. Some people have also revealed their hearts: “I hate the idea of regular patching to make up for mistakes, or regular patching for other defects caused by early game launches. Usually this means that the product is problematic, it means a bad player experience, it means it’s an incomplete game.”</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In fact, whether it is an online game or a AAA masterpiece, the frequency of updates is a matter of concern and headache for game manufacturers and players. For games of different categories, developers should always take the player’s voice into consideration and formulate the most suitable update rhythm based on their own characteristics. In recent years, some AAA games have collapsed in reputation after their launch, making some fans worried; however, as the impact of the epidemic gradually dissipates, the industry’s capital operations and mergers and acquisitions are more focused on the game products themselves, and the R&amp;D strategies of some developers are more centralized, we believe that the chances of seeing “incomplete games” will become less and less!</p>

    <title>Making Players Unable to Stop - The Role of the Zeigarnik Effect in Game Design</title>
    <url>/2023/07/12/netease-ux-articles/news_20230712_28584_1098338/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230712/28584_1098338.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You may have had the following experiences: during an exam, you can clearly remember various key points and details, but after the exam, these details become blurred in your mind; you fill out a quiz in an H5, but are told to forward and share it to see the results; a variety show is about to announce the promotion results, but suddenly a commercial break appears, and you have to wait patiently for the commercial to finish before watching the results.</p>
<p>All of these cases are related to a psychological effect called the “Zeigarnik Effect,” and this theory is also applied to the experience design in the game field. This article will introduce the Zeigarnik Effect and its application examples in the game field, and discuss how designers can use the Zeigarnik Effect to attract players’ attention and make them “unable to stop.”</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive"><a href="#1-The-Zeigarnik-Effect-and-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive"></a>1. The Zeigarnik Effect and Completion Drive</h2><p>The Zeigarnik Effect states that humans have a drive to do things from beginning to end, and they have a strong motivation to complete unfinished tasks, and they focus more attention on these unfinished tasks. The reason why people forget completed work is because the motivation to complete it has been satisfied; if the work is not yet completed, the same motivation will make them have a deep impression of it, and their attention will tend to focus on it. Unfinished tasks that are interrupted midway are not only easy to recall, but also have a tendency to continue to be completed after other work has been done.</p>
<p>The reason why many games are addictive can be explained by the Zeigarnik Effect. Take <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> as an example. After the player determines a certain unactivated tower as the main goal, although they will deviate from the route to experience a lot of extra content (such as opening shrines, finding Korok seeds, and clearing enemy strongholds), they will generally continue to move towards the main goal.</p>
<p>When the player sets the destination at the starting point, the desire to complete has already been generated. Before the desire to complete this matter is satisfied, no matter what is done along the way, the player will still retain part of their attention on the main goal. Therefore, the rich exploration content along the way will not affect the basic goal. At the same time, the completion drive supports the player to continue moving forward until they reach the main goal. In this process, the Zeigarnik Effect plays a great role. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F856bbb76-9f47-4a2f-bec1-d57d275df169.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《The Legend of Zelda》: The content between one starting point and another tower is very rich, but it will not affect the player’s final arrival at the main goal.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Since the Zeigarnik Effect can effectively focus people’s attention on specific events and spontaneously generate a strong completion drive, designers can fully utilize this effect to make players’ intentions more easily aligned with design goals. Next, we will introduce some design methods and points to note that allow the Zeigarnik Effect to work.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive"><a href="#2-How-Experience-Design-Utilizes-the-Zeigarnik-Effect-to-Mobilize-Players’-Completion-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive"></a>2. How Experience Design Utilizes the Zeigarnik Effect to Mobilize Players’ Completion Drive</h2><h3 id="Visualized-Progress-Incentive"><a href="#Visualized-Progress-Incentive" class="headerlink" title="Visualized Progress Incentive"></a>Visualized Progress Incentive</h3><p>Providing clear and transparent progress prompts can make players aware of their current completed progress and the remaining amount of tasks to be completed. The certainty brought by this transparent progress information can make players more confident in the task process, thereby having a higher completion drive. There are many ways to express progress information, and visualizing progress information is an efficient and widely used way of conveying information.</p>
<p>For example, in the 3D platform jumping game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, at the beginning of each level, players are told the number of Moons needed to pass the level, and the target number of Moons and the number currently obtained are clearly marked in the HUD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Ff50cd137-505f-49df-8d0e-27744e0a7584.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Super Mario Odyssey》 In-game HUD: How many more Moons the player needs to collect is clearly marked.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In some special situations, clear progress information may play a stronger positive encouraging role. <em>Cuphead</em> is a 2D platform jumping shooting game known for its high difficulty. Its high challenge not only does not discourage a large number of players, but players may even become more frustrated and even addicted in the process of continuous challenge failures, and some design details in the game play a boosting role. For example, the settlement interface where players fail the challenge in the game will display the level position reached in this round, allowing players to clearly see the completed level progress and the remaining level progress. In the boss level, they can also see the boss stage markers that have the same function as milestones, which can effectively encourage players to re-challenge this level; especially when the player is close to the finish line, they will have a stronger completion drive.</p>
<p>The following is the failure interface of <em>Cuphead</em> (the top is the original interface, the bottom is the interface without the level progress bar): Imagine if you see the interface below every time you fail, is it easier to lose your goal and even give up the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F58abcf77-ffd1-43e1-a133-03cfe6854128.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F24ef2fbc-9d2f-471d-97fc-eb23a4d043dc.png/size/"></p>
<p>In addition, the expression of progress information can also try to use interesting gameplay for packaging. <em>The Tiny Bang Story</em> is a level-based puzzle game with item finding and collection as the main gameplay. Jigsaw puzzles are a kind of level collection in the game. At the end of each level, players will enter a jigsaw puzzle mini-game interface. Each level can get fragments and complete part of the jigsaw puzzle by themselves. When the jigsaw puzzle is completely completed, the game is cleared. The developer uses the jigsaw puzzle gameplay combined with the game’s worldview to package the game progress in an interesting way. Each completed jigsaw puzzle part corresponds to the level map that has just passed. Players can roughly judge the game progress through the area of the unfinished jigsaw puzzle. This kind of level ending interface that is both ritualistic and interesting can leave a deeper impression. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F7e023bba-40d7-4753-8223-cebcfa2b1e66.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks"><a href="#Breaking-Down-Large-Tasks-into-Small-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks"></a>Breaking Down Large Tasks into Small Tasks</h3><p>To make it easier for players to advance the task flow, large tasks can be broken down into small tasks. This design will reduce the perceived workload of players and make them more likely to put in effort. The character creation process of <em>Biomutant</em> is relatively complicated. If all functions are arranged in the same interface by switching tabs, it may cause certain pressure on players. Therefore, in the game, these pre-settings are divided into several small steps, allowing players to choose to focus on the content of the current page or directly generate it randomly, so that it is not easy to think that these processes are too cumbersome and leave a bad experience impression. </p>

<hr>
<p>The same design can also be seen in the mandatory feature demonstration process of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. This process briefly shows players several new features of the controller before players officially enter the game. The designer breaks down all new features into five experience steps so that players can focus on experiencing the current feature in turn, rather than feeling overwhelmed by a bunch of new features and ending the experience hastily. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F54882e2b-a03a-4ade-b8ea-303036d7f819.jpg/size/"></p>

<p>In <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, there is a casual gameplay called Bamboo Strike Challenge. Players need to quickly press the buttons in sequence according to the button sequence instructions on the screen to complete the bamboo cutting. The condition for a successful challenge is that the player quickly presses 7 buttons in sequence. In this challenge task, the player’s completion motivation is very clear, but it is difficult to master the clicking sequence of these seven buttons at once and press them quickly. The player’s completion drive is likely to be suppressed in frustration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge is generally divided into three gradual steps. In the first step, players only need to complete the bamboo cutting of three buttons, which is very simple; the second step adds two button presses on the basis of the first step. Players have basically mastered the method of quickly pressing five buttons here, and have already satisfied the desire to complete the first two steps; the third step is based on the second step. Two more buttons are added on the basis of the step. This step is very challenging, but because of the practice in the first two steps, players will be more likely to master the skills. At the same time, because they are close to completing the goal, the player’s motivation to complete will be stronger, and the possibility of persisting in completing the challenge will be higher. </p>

<h3 id="Artificial-Advancement-Effect"><a href="#Artificial-Advancement-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Advancement Effect"></a>Artificial Advancement Effect</h3><p>To better stimulate the player’s completion drive, designers can also try to let players regard the task as “unfinished” rather than “not started”. Here, another psychological term that is often mentioned along with the Zeigarnik Effect is introduced - the Artificial Advancement Effect. The Artificial Advancement Effect is also related to strengthening the drive for action. This theory states that if a person is artificially provided with some progress towards achieving a goal, that person will be more motivated to complete the goal.</p>
<p>A classic example is the car wash membership card experiment. In the experiment, researchers distributed two types of cards with stamps to exchange for free car wash opportunities, but one of them had eight empty stamp spaces, and the other had two stamped spaces and eight empty stamp spaces. Theoretically speaking, both types of cards need to collect 8 more stamps to get a car wash opportunity. But after nine months, 19% of those with the first type of card successfully redeemed the car wash opportunity, while as many as 34% of the latter redeemed the car wash opportunity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F3a29f546-5ee6-4042-9073-1f16a33f4836.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the “Celestial Weaver” appearance extraction interface of <em>Revelation M</em>, players can get a free extraction opportunity every day. We can try to analyze this reward distribution method from the perspective of the Zeigarnik Effect: First, this extraction opportunity breaks the player’s impression of the current cycle of extraction progress as “not started”. Secondly, the progress reward of the prize pool becomes a state of “unfinished”, thereby stimulating the player’s desire and drive to complete the progress reward. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fa2ad06dc-2315-4104-a615-6fb1db29fa47.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Goal-Gradient-Effect"><a href="#Goal-Gradient-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Goal Gradient Effect"></a>Goal Gradient Effect</h3><p>In addition, the psychological effect closely related to the Zeigarnik Effect is the Goal Gradient Effect. Using the Goal Gradient Effect can also better mobilize the player’s completion drive. The Goal Gradient Effect means that when a person is close to the goal, the drive for action will be stronger. At this time, the manifestation of the enhanced drive for action is to accelerate their own actions in order to reach the goal faster, and to be willing to spend more costs to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>The application of the Goal Gradient Effect on the interface is not uncommon. The more familiar case should be the progress bars of various APPs that are stuck at 99% and difficult to continue. The first 99% is accumulated effortlessly. Compared with the so-called 99% sunk cost, users care more about the last 1% that seems to be within reach. This “fake” progress bar can make users willing to invest more time and effectively enhance users’ willingness to continue waiting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F29ffea0e-0d7e-4f70-833c-63c0a442d729.png/size/"></p>
<p>In some games, design details can be seen where designers use progress prompts to enhance players’ drive for action. For example, in the physics-based puzzle game <em>World of Goo</em>, every time the player builds, if they are closer to the end pipe opening, it will trigger a “xx meters left” text feedback. This progress prompt will make the player’s completion drive stronger the closer they get to the pipe opening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F2a1fccfc-b2ad-4ef4-ac40-faeced9b069e.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《World of Goo》 Distance prompt</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is a similar design in <em>Battlefield 1</em>. The player’s rank promotion is represented by a circular progress bar and an iconized level to express the player’s current level and the progress of this level. In addition, the estimated time cost required for promotion is also specially marked. When the completion cost is within the player’s acceptable range, it is easier to stimulate their completion drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2Fd0706694-f304-47a0-ad29-fa7824668141.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Positive-Feedback"><a href="#Positive-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Positive Feedback"></a>Positive Feedback</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the Zeigarnik Effect achieves the effect of deepening impression and attracting attention through the player’s unfulfilled desire to complete. Although players can obtain a certain amount of mental pleasure through the satisfaction of the desire to complete, designers still need to pay attention to giving players positive feedback at the right time during the task process to avoid leaving an overall negative feeling greater than the positive feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230712%2F8ba84e12-abc1-4d1f-818f-9190d8fa5cf4.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>In summary, experience design can utilize visualized progress incentives, task decomposition, the Artificial Advancement Effect, the Goal Gradient Effect, and appropriate positive feedback, etc., to make the Zeigarnik Effect play a better role. But no matter what the designer does, it is to guide the player to more easily reach agreement with the design goal and help the player better complete each game goal. The fundamental purpose is always to allow players to have a better gaming experience.</p>

    <title>Meaning and Rhythm in Games How Poetry Localization Empowers Text</title>
    <url>/2023/07/13/netease-ux-articles/news_20230717_28584_1099119/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230717/28584_1099119.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For game players or poetry readers, games and poetry are not conventionally compatible art forms.</p>
<p>After all, most poetry expresses serious themes, often involving poets’ reflections on life, death, emotions, and landscapes, or their deepest cries and expressions. Games, on the other hand, seem like a relatively simpler, more direct form of entertainment.</p>
<p>But from an artistic perspective, games are very much like a melting pot. Whether it’s text or images, static or dynamic, once melted into the game, its artistic form becomes multi-dimensional, and its expression becomes diverse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the former, an ancient and solitary art, is revitalized by merging with a new and lively art form.</p>
<h2 id="1-Poetry-and-Games"><a href="#1-Poetry-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Poetry and Games"></a>1. Poetry and Games</h2><p>Although they are very different fields, in some ways, isn’t writing poetry a kind of word game? Burying meaning, arranging and rhyming, exquisite deliberation, design, and revision, mirrors the process of creating a game.</p>
<p>Similarly, games can be created and expressed in a poetic way.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Royal Festival Hall in London hosted an exhibition by the National Poetry Library called “Poetry Games”. In the exhibition, people could create their own poems through block games. Murray, the organizer of the exhibition, hoped to attract people who are not very fond of entering the poetry library but are familiar with the language of games, to weaken the image of poetry as obscure and difficult to understand in textbooks. People may simply be playing games, and then suddenly burst into inspiration, find that poetry is actually very interesting, and unconsciously write down words. He also mentioned that now all art forms are learning from games, and poetry should do the same.</p>
<p>Indeed, various art forms are already on the road to integration with games.</p>
<p>So when we look at it from the other side, the end of the road, many games themselves are already embedded with rich poetry and poetic language. In <em>Fallout</em>, if the player hacks the terminal of the ghoul Tulip, they can read John Milton’s 17th-century British epic <em>Paradise Lost</em>. In <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, there are more than 73 poems, songs, and letters, which have even been compiled into a website system for enthusiasts to consult. It can be described as a literary and poetic feast originating from the game.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the game world of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, an epic poem called “Loveless” tells the story of three men searching for the legendary “Gift of the Goddess”. This poem has made several cameos in the game’s compilation and was later adapted into a musical stage play. There is also a street named after it in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to directly presenting complete poems, many games have also found other ways to integrate poetry. For example, in the game <em>Wayfinder</em>, players need to control characters to wander in a beautiful world full of poetry, collect fragmented words, and finally compile them into complete fragments to create a poem about the land the protagonist is exploring. Another example is a fantasy adventure game called <em>Elegy for a Dead World</em>, which takes players into landscapes inspired by the poems of Shelley, Keats, and Byron, and then guides them to write directly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2Fb2d0d32f-4db1-4935-891c-bf068657c81a.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Elegy for a Dead World》</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A more direct creation is Ross Sutherland, the producer of <em>Street Fighter II</em>, who released original sonnets based on Street Fighter on National Poetry Day, depicting and creating a new mythical world composed of 12 heroes from Street Fighter.</p>
<p>Therefore, although niche, cultural art forms such as poetry have quietly infiltrated the game content production process in a quiet and special way.</p>
<h2 id="2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry"><a href="#2-Characteristic-Localization-of-Poetry" class="headerlink" title="2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry"></a>2. Characteristic Localization of Poetry</h2><p>If we call the combination of poetry and games a bold fusion, then the localization of poetry in games is like a kind mother who has to tolerate the waywardness of children.</p>
<p>When faced with the expressive desire of poetry in games and its hidden cultural heritage, how to retain the original meaning and emotion of the poem, reflect the rhythm and language style of the poem, and also consider the target language, cultural characteristics, and the acceptance of the audience, is a challenge that every worker in the localization process needs to think deeply about and overcome.</p>
<p>Taking <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> mentioned above as an example, the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game has become an ancient legendary poem widely sung in the game’s story background with its smooth rhythm and simple arrangement. Some clumsy and absurd jokes and names have been specially added to the simple chanting rhythm to highlight how ridiculous it is that a rookie alchemist obtained a potion that made him smart in a pure accident.</p>
<p>Although the English version of the “Song of the Alchemists” uses simple words, the rhythm is interlocking. It starts with end rhyme, interestingly unfolding the beginning of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When King Maraneon’s alchemist had to leave his station</p>
<p>After a laboratory experiment that yielded detonation,</p>
<p>The word went out that the King did want</p>
<p>A new savant</p>
<p>To mix his potions and brews.</p>
<p>But he declared he would only choose</p>
<p>A fellow who knew the tricks and the tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation uses words such as “开除 (kāi chú - fired)”, “缘故 (yuán gù - reason)”, and “奴仆 (nú pú - servant)” to retain the pronunciation of “brews” and “choose” in English, completing the end rhyme and promoting the easy-to-sing characteristic of this poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>国王马兰尼恩的炼金术士被<strong>开除</strong></p>
<p>由于他的实验室爆炸了的<strong>缘故</strong></p>
<p>国王诏令要新的<strong>奴仆</strong></p>
<p>为他配置药水和药物</p>
<p>但他只要一个人</p>
<p>能熟练掌握炼金术的技巧和工具的用途</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the more difficult combination of alliteration + end rhyme, Chinese loses some of its color. For example, in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much deliberation, discussions, and debates,</p>
<p>The King picked two well-learned candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text has both alliteration of “deliberation, discussions, and debates” and the echo of end rhyme of “debates and candidates”. The Chinese version can only be translated literally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>通过大量的考虑、讨论、辩争</p>
<p>国王最后选了两位有才的候选人</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is related to the characteristics of the language itself. It is indeed difficult for Chinese to achieve both meaning, alliteration, and end rhyme, and to be fluent and rhythmic. However, the use of written language like “通过大量的考虑 (tōng guò dà liàng de kǎo lǜ - through a lot of consideration)” in poetry seems abrupt and awkward. Therefore, from the perspective of whether it conforms to the characteristics of “easy to sing”, “narrative”, “rhythm” and “teasing” of the “Song of the Alchemists” in the game, although this Chinese localized text has some processing that fits the original text, it has not been further scrutinized.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, in the game <em>The Witcher 3</em>, players can also come into contact with many ancient poems, including original poems based on the game’s background story, as well as excellent works from the Middle Ages. For example, the quote from the Ladies of the Wood in the game is taken from the original text of Act 1, Scene 3 of <em>Macbeth</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land, thus do go about, about: thrice to thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original text is precise and powerful, not only in rhythm, but also in syllables and format.</p>
<p>For example, “Sister crones, hand in hand, terrors of the sea and land” is a perfect introductory sentence in terms of format, with both smooth syllable arrangement and rhythmic echo. Moreover, “thrice”, “thine”, “mine” and “nine” appear alternately, making the rhythm of the poem like undulating peaks, giving readers a repeated and enjoyable singing.</p>
<p>Looking at the text alone, players or readers may find it difficult to understand. But in connection with the image of the Ladies of the Wood in the game, the mystery of this text can be broken.</p>
<p>There are three Ladies of the Wood, namely Weavess, Brewess, and Whispess, and their powerful magic comes from the land. For the local residents, they are both gods to rely on and demons that take lives. On the one hand, the Ladies of the Wood reward devout believers who offer sacrifices, eliminate the disasters and difficulties they face, and help the villagers through difficult times; on the other hand, they demand absolute obedience from believers and occasionally require villagers to sacrifice their hair, ears, or even their children.</p>
<p>Moreover, not everyone can see the three ladies: most people can only participate in the dinner at the campfire at the foot of the mountain, and the ladies will select beautiful guests who satisfy them from these people, usually three, and then these young men and women will go up to the mountain to spend the night with them. When these three young men and women come back, they never mention what happened at the night meeting, and even forget their past, just full of joy, as if they were reborn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2F09b586db-7b77-4bde-8fef-0dffe49440ce.png/size/"></p>
<p>With the background story of the game in mind, in the existing translations, we can read Zhu Shenghao’s translation of this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>沧海高山弹指地，朝飞暮返害人命，</p>
<p>姐三巡，妹三巡，三三九转蛊方成。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese translation also starts with a similar syllable arrangement of “三姐妹，手牵手 (sān jiě mèi, shǒu qiān shǒu - three sisters, hand in hand)”, successfully continuing the jingle-like introduction of the original text. At the same time, the translation also shows the powerful and dialectical abilities of the three sisters: they can both overturn the world and possibly harm people’s lives. In addition to the end rhyme of “地 (dì - land)” and “命 (mìng - life)”, the translation cleverly replaces the “you” and “me” of the original text with “姐三巡，妹三巡 (jiě sān xún, mèi sān xún - sister three rounds, sister three rounds)”, which not only conforms to the meaning of the original text, but also achieves rhyme again and reproduces the poetic and chanting sense.</p>
<p>However, the actual Chinese localization of <em>The Witcher 3</em> game is much inferior to this translation. The traditional Chinese version of the text not only loses the syllable arrangement, but also makes the poem seem like many unordered dancers running around on the stage due to literal translation and the combination of uncommon sentence patterns. There is no rhythm, no music, and no lighting rehearsal, presenting a strange dance performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>老巫妪，三姐妹，手牵手，</p>
<p>穿梭海陆，吓破人胆，如此前进，</p>
<p>三次我，三次你，又三次，总共九。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence “老巫妪，三姐妹 (lǎo wū yù, sān jiě mèi - old crones, three sisters)” is awkward as the opening sentence, and although “手牵手 (shǒu qiān shǒu - hand in hand)” and “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” have sentence structure and end rhyme, the long sentence in the middle has already fragmented the rhythm. “三次我，三次你 (sān cì wǒ, sān cì nǐ - thrice me, thrice you)” is also a completely literal translation. From the perspective of Chinese, readers simply cannot understand the meaning. Similarly, “总共九 (zǒng gòng jiǔ - nine in total)” is also like an incomplete sentence, which not only does not conform to Chinese sentence habits, but also fails to express any meaning. Even after reading the whole text, it does not help to understand the image and status of the Ladies of the Wood in the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games"><a href="#3-Text-Empowerment-and-Trade-offs-in-the-Localization-of-Poetry-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games"></a>3. Text Empowerment and Trade-offs in the Localization of Poetry in Games</h2><p>The translation and localization of poetry and cultural content in games is crucial to the success and market expansion of games. However, this translation and localization also face many challenges, requiring the knowledge base and in-depth understanding of translators and localization teams. In the process of translation and localization, it is necessary to balance the original meaning and cultural differences, and to consider the acceptance of the readers.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality and efficiency of poetry translation and localization, professional translation and localization aids can be used, clear standards can be formulated, and cultural experts can be cooperated with for review and testing.</p>
<p>For example, in the localization process of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, for short but very rhythmic poetry texts, we usually deal with them as English sentences that conform to rhyme and are catchy. For example, the description text of the costume [Spring Snow]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>碎雪浮青叶，风暖春无垠。</p>
<p>(Fragmented snow floats on green leaves, the wind is warm and spring is boundless.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the basis of neat Chinese characters and smooth rhythm, English also uses end rhyme to show a beautiful scene of spring and melting snow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spring comes with the warm breeze, snow melted then appear the leaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, for some poems and classical Chinese texts that introduce the background story, the primary task of localization is not to rhyme and promote its literary nature, but to be easy to understand and break down cultural barriers.</p>
<p>For example, in the <em>Journey to the West</em> series of appearances, the game quotes the original text of <em>Journey to the West</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>混元体正合先天，万劫千番只自然。</p>
<p>(The primordial body is in harmony with nature, and thousands of eons are just natural.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If too much of the artistic conception that Chinese wants to express is retained here, the translation will become extremely lengthy and lose the original form and meaning of the poem. Therefore, after referring to Anthony C. Yu’s authoritative translation, it is handled here as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cosmic being fully fused with nature’s gifts.</p>
<p>Passes with ease through ten thousand toils and tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230717%2F8d30fbc7-f1be-4e1d-8c39-3d64c3bbde2c.png/size/"></p>
<p>After making trade-offs in the expression of the text and shortening the wording, the words “混元 (hùn yuán - primordial)”, “先天 (xiān tiān - innate)”, and “劫 (jié - eon)” with strong cultural imagery in Chinese poetry are stripped of their mystery, eliminating the unnecessary burden of understanding, expressing the original meaning more directly, and ensuring the neatness and brevity of the sentence structure.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>Cultural differences are a wayward and naughty child in the development of various artistic works. It is wanton, slick, and the barriers it forms often hinder the spread of many excellent works.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the continuous expansion of the game market and the trend of globalization, the localization of poetry in games will become a novel and complex topic. Game developers and localization personnel need to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies and trends to meet the needs of players from different countries and cultural backgrounds, break down cultural barriers, and reduce the difficulty of understanding; at the same time, they also need to continue to pay attention to balancing the original meaning and cultural differences, and consider the acceptance of readers to provide a better gaming experience. In this process, the localization team should work closely together and make joint efforts to become a strong communicator and trailblazer for players in the game world.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the era of rapid development of information technology and globalization, as the influence of games on the economy and society continues to increase, it is also increasingly changing the composition of the culture and entertainment industries. Under this premise, esports has emerged as a new competitive mode, gradually becoming one of the most promising fields in the world from its initial niche status. In the emerging South American game market in recent years, the esports industry in Brazil is particularly prosperous. It has hosted many esports exhibitions and attracted investment and sponsorship from many large European and American manufacturers.</p>
<p>Why is esports so popular in Brazil? What are the characteristics of esports development here? What level have Brazilian professional teams reached in this industry? Let’s explore the answers to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends"><a href="#1-Esports-Market-and-Development-Trends" class="headerlink" title="1. Esports Market and Development Trends"></a>1. Esports Market and Development Trends</h2><p>In 2019, among Brazil’s total population of 210 million, there were 75.7 million game players, close to 36% of the total population.</p>
<p>In 2020, Brazil became the country with the fourth largest number of esports viewers in the world, second only to India, China, and the United States. In addition, in Brazil, the recognition that “esports is a sports event” reached 53%, ranking first in the world. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F6d0abd13-429c-4a22-86d8-183aaa707422.png/size/" alt="PwC Data on Brazil&#39;s Esports Market"></p>
<p>According to a survey by PwC, in 2021, the total revenue of video games and esports in Brazil was approximately US$1.4 billion, surpassing Mexico to become the largest market in Latin America. The survey also showed that this figure is expected to reach US$2.8 billion by 2026, which is double in less than five years, accounting for 47.4% of the total revenue of games and esports in Latin America. According to SiGMA statistics, in esports alone, Brazil’s revenue is expected to reach US$16.03 million in 2023 and maintain a compound annual growth rate of 7.75% by 2027.</p>
<p>In terms of game preferences, Newzoo pointed out that although Brazilian users are closer to North American countries, Brazilians prefer shooting, racing, sports, and strategy mobile games. In addition, games with social attributes are also very popular among Latin American players. Therefore, Brazilian teams are also active in esports events of these game types. Brazilian teams can be seen in many major esports projects such as <em>CS:GO</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>.</p>
<p>In the list of the most discussed esports players in the first half of 2022, Brazilian players occupied three of the top ten. In the top ten list of esports clubs, Brazilian clubs occupied four. In 2022, 4,352 Brazilians received a total of US$47 million in prize money from 3,275 competitions, making the country rank seventh in the world in esports profitability.</p>
<h2 id="2-Sports-and-Esports"><a href="#2-Sports-and-Esports" class="headerlink" title="2. Sports and Esports"></a>2. Sports and Esports</h2><p>Speaking of sports, when it comes to Brazil, “football” must be the first word that most people think of. In fact, in addition to football, volleyball is also their strength. The Brazilian women’s volleyball team has always been a strong opponent of the Chinese women’s volleyball team. In other sports, Brazilians have also left their mark. Surfing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and racing are all their strengths. Long-term sports experience has also spawned Brazil’s unique competitive culture, making Brazilians highly receptive to esports projects.</p>
<p>Brazilian players like the two-sided competition mode from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, in this country, esports is also becoming a national sport like football. With no well-known game manufacturers in the country, the Brazilian esports market is still maintaining a healthy development trend. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional sports events were cancelled or suspended, which also allowed esports to develop at a higher speed as an alternative entertainment option. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F9ef84033-7b32-4919-ae76-5b3f45fc4c88.jpg/size/" alt="Brazilian Esports Spectators"></p>
<p>In MOBA esports projects such as <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Dota</em>, which require more strategy, Brazilians perform relatively conservatively; while FPS projects, which require more instinct and motor nerves, are the areas where they shine. The glory of the Brazilian team in FPS can be traced back to 2006. At that time, at the World Cyber Games (WCG), Chinese player Sky won the championship of the <em>Warcraft III</em> project for the second time, while the mibr team from Brazil won the championship of the <em>CS 1.6</em> project, creating a glorious moment for Brazil. Until 2022, Brazil also became the only country to win the biggest championship in the three major mainstream tactical shooting games.</p>
<p>The deep integration of Brazilian esports and traditional sports is also relatively rare in other countries. The fans of both sides highly overlap in identity and are very enthusiastic about participation. The culture of traditional sports is introduced into esports by fans, which is fully reflected in last year’s “CS:GO Rio Major”. Brazilian fans brought jerseys, drums and even fireworks to the closed stadium. The stadium was filled with drums, the uniform cheers of fans and the pervasive smoke, making people feel like they were in a crazy Brazilian football stadium. This Major attracted more than 1.5 million people to watch online at the same time, setting a new record for <em>CS:GO</em> competitions. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F6d6f8804-cf7c-4bea-9a7d-174d228fc3de.jpg/size/" alt="CS:GO Rio Major"></p>
<p>The enthusiasm of Brazilian football stars for esports has also encouraged more fans. Brazil’s top star Neymar is an FPS expert. <em>PUBG</em> and <em>CS:GO</em> are his favorite game projects. During the <em>CS:GO</em> Rio Major, the football superstar watched the game of the local team FURIA with his friends at home, and cheered for it on his personal social media. <em>PUBG</em>‘s developer KRAFTON did not miss the opportunity to cooperate with Neymar for marketing. In 2022, Neymar officially became the official publicity ambassador of <em>PUBG</em>, and KRAFTON also focused on expanding in the Americas. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fec08802c-3740-4040-a3d8-4b01507a0269.png/size/" alt="Brazilian Football Stars and FURIA"></p>
<p>Four Brazilian national team players put on the jerseys of the FURIA team (from left: Casemiro, Neymar, Paquetá, Arthur)</p>
<p>Many football clubs in Brazil are also actively participating in the esports industry. The famous club Flamengo is one of them. The team is very famous in Brazil and has the largest number of fans in Brazil, with about 13 million supporters. Its esports club, Flamengo eSports, won the second season of the 2019 CBLoL (<em>League of Legends</em> Brazilian League). In addition, Neymar’s old club, the famous football club Santos, also established its own Santos esports team in July 2018 after three years of cooperation with Dexterity Team.</p>
<p>Thanks to the high integration of football and esports, Brazilian esports teams are also performing well in the <em>FIFA</em> series. In the “FIFA22 eNations Cup” hosted by EA SPORTS, the Brazilian team defeated the Spanish team, the Italian team, and the defending champion French team in one fell swoop to win the championship.</p>
<h2 id="3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports"><a href="#3-The-Unique-Favela-Esports" class="headerlink" title="3. The Unique Favela Esports"></a>3. The Unique Favela Esports</h2><p>Brazil has always been a country with a large slum population. World Bank data shows that in 2016, the slum population of various cities in Brazil accounted for 15% of the total population. Rio de Janeiro alone has nearly 1.5 million people living in slums, more than 20% of the city’s population. And Brazil’s various slums have always been a major source of competitive talent. Football superstars such as Pelé and Ronaldo grew up in slums.</p>
<p>However, for young people in slums, the threshold of esports is much higher than that of football. The high cost of equipment and internet makes it impossible for many young people who are interested in games to participate in this competition.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Brazil’s slums are also undergoing a digital transformation. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F7963c4fb-d957-408a-9849-77476ef68cfb.png/size/" alt="AfroGames Esports Center"></p>
<p>In 2019, with the promotion of the Rio esports charity AfroGames, Brazil established the world’s first esports center in a slum. AfroGames personnel once said, “We realized that only children from the middle and upper classes can afford esports activities. In an esports environment dominated by whites and Asians, AfroGames hopes to help change the status quo of our country by creating such a project”.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also esports clubs like Zero Gravity that only sign low-income young people from slums.</p>
<p>Esports events for young people in slums, such as the Favelas Cup and the Favelas Bowl, also provide opportunities for players who need financial support to win prize money.</p>
<p>The Favelas Cup and Favelas Bowl use the tactical competitive mobile game <em>Free Fire</em> as the competition project, and are open to slum players across Brazil. In the 2020 Favelas Cup, the Central Única das Favelas (CUFA) selected 48 participating teams from the slums of 26 states and federal districts in Brazil, 12 of which entered the finals. The total viewing time of the finals live broadcast reached 290,000 hours.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to reach most of Brazil’s poor communities, provide esports competitions, and encourage children and teenagers to enter the world of technology and innovation,” said Tifanny Nayara, the hostess and anchor of the Favelas Cup. According to her, the Favelas Cup reached “about 100 slums, 200 registered teams and a total of 800 players across the country.” With such widespread dissemination, more and more young people in Brazil hope to change their destiny through esports and get the opportunity to get out of the slums.</p>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>In Brazil’s strong esports atmosphere, holding esports events has undoubtedly become an important way for Chinese companies going overseas to expand their influence.</p>
<p>Due to the expensive price of consoles and PCs in the local area, it is obvious that ordinary Brazilian players prefer mobile games. Therefore, many manufacturers choose to use mobile game events as an entry point when deploying the Brazilian market, so that products can quickly enter the vision of the majority of ordinary people and even slum players, and use simple and direct publicity models to trigger the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Discord player community of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we often see players’ expectations and discussions about event activities. Even the Naraka: Bladepoint Pro League (NBPL) for mainland China can attract Brazilian KOLs to live broadcast and explain to players through Twitch.</p>
<p>It is foreseeable that if new overseas games in the future, especially mobile games, are released to the Brazilian market, being able to launch independent South American or Brazilian events will definitely trigger greater enthusiasm from players. The Brazilian players’ aggressive style of play in the competition will also make sports and FPS esports events more enjoyable, further attracting a large esports audience and achieving the diversion and promotion of new games.</p>

    <title>The Appearance and Disappearance of Information - Game Tooltip Design</title>
    <url>/2023/07/24/netease-ux-articles/news_20230726_28584_1101043/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230726/28584_1101043.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A tooltip is a common graphical user interface element. When a player hovers the mouse over an interface element that needs annotation, a tooltip will appear on the screen to provide supplementary game information.</p>
<p>Its existence not only helps players understand and identify information content, but also helps players process this information more efficiently, or guides players to perform a series of operations—without tooltips providing non-critical or additional information to users, information omission or overload is likely to occur.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Role-of-Tooltips-in-Game-Interaction"><a href="#1-The-Role-of-Tooltips-in-Game-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="1. The Role of Tooltips in Game Interaction"></a>1. The Role of Tooltips in Game Interaction</h2><p>On PC, players use the mouse to interact with various elements in the game on the screen, including the three basic states when interacting with the mouse: normal state, hover state (mouse hover), and active state (mouse click). The tooltip is a very common interaction element in the hover state, used to supplement the relevant information of the element.</p>
<p>Tooltips are an important form and component of game information prompts, and play a role in improving the efficiency of players reading information, guiding and confirming player operations in game interaction. The following will take PC <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as the main case to introduce the role of tooltips in game interaction.</p>
<h3 id="Improve-the-Efficiency-of-Players-Reading-Information"><a href="#Improve-the-Efficiency-of-Players-Reading-Information" class="headerlink" title="Improve the Efficiency of Players Reading Information"></a>Improve the Efficiency of Players Reading Information</h3><p>In a game with a more complex mechanism, the information conveyed to users also increases relatively. Therefore, the interactive interface usually uses concise graphics and text as much as possible, so that users can receive an appropriate amount of key information in the game, and more detailed information is presented in the form of tooltips, so as to assist in displaying non-critical information and achieve on-demand and efficient access to information.</p>
<p>Take the interface of selecting existing Souljades in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example. In the Souljade backpack list, the obtained Souljades are arranged horizontally in the form of “icon + Souljade name”. For experienced players, they can directly use this concise information (background quality color, Souljade shape&#x2F;name) to decide whether to pick up, replace, or discard Souljades, and make the fastest strategic decisions; while novice players can understand what the function of the Souljade is through the tooltip, and the key prompts for related operations, they can also familiarize themselves with the game and extract information and make in-game decisions relatively efficiently. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F58ef1859-ba2d-43c3-8050-291be83af026.png/size/"></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>At the same time, because the tooltip is an interactive element of the hover state, it will appear or disappear with the movement of the mouse, rather than being presented in a normal state like key information. Therefore, even if novice players are already familiar with the Souljade mechanism of the game, they will not feel that the information is complex and redundant. In addition, the game also systematically introduces the detailed information of each Souljade in the Souljade interface of the Combat Encyclopedia, which echoes the concise interaction in the game to achieve the unity of game experience playability and information comprehensiveness.</p>
<h3 id="Guide-and-Confirm-Player-Operations"><a href="#Guide-and-Confirm-Player-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Guide and Confirm Player Operations"></a>Guide and Confirm Player Operations</h3><p>One of the functions of tooltips is to guide user operations, and the embodiment in the game is usually key prompts. The key prompt box highlights the key prompt information of shortcut operations to facilitate players to perform quick operations. The figure below shows the key prompt for indicating the number of Bloodrippers to teammates in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. This is the most typical and concise form of key prompt box, namely key icon and text description. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5a249441-e421-462a-aadc-b3acddc8ef31.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Tooltip Key Prompt</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the weapon backpack of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, it also includes the enlarged icon of the weapon and the content of the weapon name. This is more abundant than the tooltip on the left, which is convenient for users to make decisions based on the supplementary information provided in the tooltip; compared with various inconvenient-to-remember information of Souljades, the content of the weapon tooltip is concise, omitting more weapon introduction content. This is because players have common sense understanding of weapons in real life. Whether it is a concise or rich form, this is related to the functionality of the interactive interface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fbb7f5106-12ff-4bf2-8a7d-1f1aea60e668.png/size/"></p>
<p>It is worth noting that this type of prompt is usually closely related to the element that is currently in the hover state. The equip&#x2F;discard shortcut keys in the figure are applicable to all items in the backpack, but in terms of use, they are related to the area where the mouse is hovering. The tooltip here also enlarges the key content and presents it to the player, so that the player can confirm the weapon to be equipped&#x2F;discarded according to the tooltip, so as to reduce misoperation in game decision-making. Therefore, the tooltip not only provides prompt information for player operations, but also plays a role in information confirmation when players perform related operations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Tooltip-Design-Principles"><a href="#2-Tooltip-Design-Principles" class="headerlink" title="2. Tooltip Design Principles"></a>2. Tooltip Design Principles</h2><p>The simplest tooltip is often a combination of “function description + shortcut key”, which is characterized by short appearance time, association with marked elements, and short text; in fact, in games, the design of tooltips is very diverse, with different complex forms of graphic and text mixing.</p>
<p>These different forms of tooltips are born to assist the ever-changing game information presentation. But no matter how the form of the prompt changes, their purpose is to: help users understand, identify and process this information. Google has listed the principles of using tooltips in its developed Material Design, as a guide for using its web design tools. Some of the design principles contained therein also have high reference significance for game interaction design. Therefore, we will combine game cases to analyze the design specifications that need to be paid attention to in the design of tooltips, and their corresponding roles in experience design.</p>
<h3 id="Overall-Layout-Design"><a href="#Overall-Layout-Design" class="headerlink" title="Overall Layout Design"></a>Overall Layout Design</h3><p>In the overall interface that triggers the tooltip state, the tooltip is generally located at the top level of the overall interface, and can cover any interface element in the short appearance time. In order for players to see the information provided by the tooltip, a reasonable position layout is first required.</p>
<p>● <strong>Cannot be Truncated</strong></p>
<p>The most basic principle of tooltip layout is that it cannot be truncated. A truncated tooltip will greatly affect the user’s game experience, and may cause key information to be incompletely displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F2023%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fad13f836-3227-4da6-907f-1defd5d4bb89.png0726%2Fad13f836-3227-4da6-907f-1defd5d4bb89.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fad202cf3-e6fe-4750-a7fd-f5a45a483a5c.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Item Purchase Tooltip (Note: The picture below is a wrong illustration, not a game screenshot)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Relevance of Position and Control</strong></p>
<p>Because people’s visual habit of reading is from left to right, for tooltips that need to appear on the left and right sides of the corresponding element, they are usually placed on the right side. However, when the space on the right side is not enough to put down the tooltip, or the information in the space on the right side is more important than the left side and cannot be blocked, the tooltip will also be placed on the left side. Because of this, the tooltip areas we can see are often laid out in the middle of the game screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F0bd3c453-d10d-4f9f-8132-1c3d492116b1.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Item Tooltip Schematic (Note: Only one tooltip is triggered each time, this picture is a spliced picture)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, some game tooltips appear at the mouse, or at the center point of the selected control. At this time, the association between the tooltip and the selected information is stronger. For example, in the weapon interface of <em>Destiny 2</em>, the tooltip changes in real time with the position of the cursor. While the player’s line of sight moves with the cursor, the tooltip also moves with it. This is also a design in which the tooltip is strongly associated with the position of the cursor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F0f909d48-163a-4607-86c2-05a96db13196.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Destiny 2》 Weapon Interface Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the item tooltip appears on both sides of the control in order not to block the icon and other information of the in-game items. Therefore, the position of the tooltip needs to be near the control in the selected state, and the specific position layout needs to be not truncated and not conflict with the game information.</p>
<p>● <strong>Horizontal&#x2F;Vertical Layout is Related to the Interface</strong></p>
<p>The rationality of the layout is also related to the interaction elements. Because it is necessary to associate the tooltip with the hover element, the tooltips in the game screen will be close to the element in the absence of special circumstances, and the content will be highlighted through a more obvious background color.</p>
<p>The specific layout in which orientation of the corresponding element is usually related to other information in the game. For example, the option introduction tooltip in the figure below, as additional information of the vertically arranged list, is drawn out in the horizontal direction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F383f79e8-8fe7-4de4-8cec-4fd82d351967.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Marvel’s Spider-Man》 Setting Details Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Similarly, when presenting horizontal information, the prompt content is laid out on the upper and lower sides; and in order to show the matching object of the tooltip information, sometimes there are designs with arrows or connecting lines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Ffe933f09-f5c9-45d0-ad9d-0570d0d5f532.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Yacht Dice》 Guide Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Consistent with the Interface Style</strong></p>
<p>In the design of the interactive interface, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> is mainly based on the dark blue technology style interface to simulate the AR picture seen by the Spider-Man character. In the design of the tooltip, it is also unified with the overall style of the game, and some broken line visual decorations are added to the tooltip to enrich the form, but at the same time, it will not let players be distracted by the decoration and ignore the content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5a09bdaf-ac8c-4921-8336-0aa31e69e0b8.png/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Tooltip-Content-Layout-Design"><a href="#Tooltip-Content-Layout-Design" class="headerlink" title="Tooltip Content Layout Design"></a>Tooltip Content Layout Design</h3><p>● <strong>Text Content is Concise</strong></p>
<p>When the tooltip is pure text content, the text should be as concise as possible to summarize the content that needs to be supplemented, and not to add unnecessary mental activity to the player. For example, in the map of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, you can see many icons that can be hovered and interacted with, and the function of this landmark is described in a very simple way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F4720d505-1e07-44bb-87a9-10bb3adb7006.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 In-game Map Vendor Tooltip (The left picture is the simplified Chinese version, and the right picture is the German version)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, for the consideration of localization adaptation, concise text can also make the tooltip content of each language within an appropriate length. As shown in the figure above, the tooltip is to keep the width of the tooltips of different languages the same, and the height can be adaptively wrapped and changed with the length of the text, which can not only correctly present each language, but also automatically change when the planner configures different texts.</p>
<p>● <strong>Text Hierarchy Presentation Form</strong></p>
<p>In the visual text expression, the text in the tooltip is the same as other text parts, and the hierarchy of text information can be reflected by size, thickness, and color. Allow players to read more text in detail and extract the information they need quickly and use it in the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F5ce0addc-0ffc-4eef-824e-d6d017ba2471.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Event Rules Tooltip</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the writing of the text, you can use more short sentences and make good use of paragraphs to create a better reading experience for players. In addition, it should be noted that the level of the tooltip basically appears at the top level and cannot be covered by other interface elements.</p>
<p>● <strong>Graphic and Text Mixing Method: Icon + Text</strong></p>
<p>Pictures are more intuitive and faster than words in expressing information. Choosing icons that can express the meaning of words can explain the text more vividly and clearly, and make the page not too boring.</p>
<p>And the image does not need to be localized to be understood by players, so the form of “icon + text” is very suitable for cross-platform global games, which can understand the tooltip content while reading, and associate the text with the image in the brain. In this way, players can quickly associate them together when they see the same icon in different game interfaces, thereby enhancing the game experience. </p>

<h3 id="Design-of-Appearance-and-Disappearance"><a href="#Design-of-Appearance-and-Disappearance" class="headerlink" title="Design of Appearance and Disappearance"></a>Design of Appearance and Disappearance</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, in PC games, hovering and moving the mouse corresponds to the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip; in mobile games, since there is no hover interaction method, the method of clicking&#x2F;long pressing to call up the tooltip is adopted; in console games, the interaction of the handle corresponds to the mouse hover state by moving the cursor to select.</p>
<p>● <strong>Time Setting for the Appearance and Disappearance of Tooltips</strong></p>
<p>The trigger condition for the appearance of the tooltip is generally set to 0.3-0.5 seconds of mouse hover. This is to ensure that the user’s intention is to view the menu or the content behind the tooltip, rather than moving the mouse to other content or accidentally touching it. Occasionally, it will be triggered after the mouse&#x2F;cursor is moved to the corresponding control for a long time, as an entrance to the normally closed information prompt.</p>
<p>The trigger for the disappearance of the tooltip is uniformly after moving the mouse&#x2F;cursor, the control disappears after exceeding 0.5 seconds when it is not selected. Because only when the user clicks or stays outside the target area, or the mouse cursor leaves the target area and exposes the content for more than 0.5 seconds, can it be determined that the player intends to close the tooltip.</p>
<p>● <strong>Cannot Trigger Multiple Tooltips at the Same Time</strong></p>
<p>No matter what kind of game device, the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip are temporary, and have a strong match with the single element that the user is interacting with, and there is a basic principle: only a single tooltip can be triggered at the same time. Therefore, in the game, even if the UI elements overlap, the click hot zone of the tooltip still needs to be strictly divided, otherwise multiple tooltips will appear at the same time.</p>
<p>Only by ensuring that at most one tooltip is triggered, the fragmented information will not appear at the same time, so that players have a stronger willingness to read and a higher degree of understanding of the current information, and this focused presentation is also more helpful for players’ information understanding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fc15e09ec-a290-46a9-bc67-0aac73add9bf.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>《Gwent: The Witcher Card Game》 Tooltip: Only One Tooltip Can Be Triggered at a Time</em></p>

<p>● <strong>Simplified Animation Effects</strong></p>
<p>No matter what style, what display, the tooltip content must be clear and recognizable, and you cannot blindly pursue effects, and you cannot put the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>In the case that the interactive interface itself is relatively complex, the appearance and disappearance of the tooltip only needs a simple gradient transition, and even no animation effect design is needed. The main function of the tooltip is information presentation, and too gorgeous animation effects will increase the visual burden of players and hinder the reading of tooltip information.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>No matter what form the tooltip appears in, the main function is to present and hide appropriate information to the player in a timely manner. As an important part of the information prompt system, tooltips play a great role in players seeing, understanding, and using game information. Only by designing the most suitable information prompt system for the game can we create the smoothest and most natural experience for players. Therefore, for game designers, from whether to use tooltips, to the selection of tooltip content, form design, etc. are all issues that need to be carefully considered.</p>

<h2 id="1-What-is-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#1-What-is-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Skeuomorphic Design?"></a>1. What is Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphism is a form of materializing information, also known as realism. A common method is to simulate the style of real-world objects in the interface, pursuing extreme textures and light and shadow, but it can also imitate the user’s familiar operation methods. By materializing information, it improves the efficiency of people’s information understanding, reduces learning costs, and allows users to become familiar with the interface faster.</p>
<p>In games, a large number of skeuomorphic designs can not only present a more refined interface, but also fully mobilize the player’s sense of intimacy and substitution for the game, and the sense of immersion is even better. Therefore, we can often see the application of skeuomorphic design in games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F50d7c80c-ba92-4082-8905-d38be6c573e4.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Characteristics of Skeuomorphic Design</h3><ul>
<li><strong>More intuitive</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By combining information with real objects familiar to players, the presentation of information can be more intuitive and efficient. In <em>Sifu</em>, the game’s worldview and storyline are presented in the form of a collage, allowing players to see the plot at a glance, intuitively view and understand the development of the plot. The whole process is not only in line with the player’s cognition, but also allows players to better substitute into the story presented in front of them, and the information presented in the interface is also very intuitive and clear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F151a2919-d0a2-4471-bd6b-4f55f445e970.png/size/"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to accept</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On an emotional level, skeuomorphic design makes it easier for players to accept and reduces the player’s learning cost. The design of the sign-in page of <em>Onmyoji: The Card Game</em> is presented in the form of a wishing wind chime. The interface is simple and clear, which not only conforms to the player’s cognition, making it easier for players to complete the sign-in process, but also allows players to complete fortune-telling during the sign-in, making it easier to understand and accept, and improving the sign-in rate from a design perspective. </p>

<h3 id="Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#Risks-of-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="Risks of Skeuomorphic Design"></a>Risks of Skeuomorphic Design</h3><p>Skeuomorphic design can create a realistic worldview scene in the game, strengthen the atmosphere of the game by simulating objects, and enhance the player’s psychological and emotional substitution. It can be said that skeuomorphic design is one of the preferred methods for game interface design. However, with the continuous enrichment of game interface information, it is difficult to present a large amount of interface information by simply using skeuomorphic design, and it is also difficult to control the layout and hierarchy of information. To a certain extent, it may put the cart before the horse. If used improperly, a clear interaction path cannot be achieved.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design"><a href="#2-Why-Use-Skeuomorphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?"></a>2. Why Use Skeuomorphic Design?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design in games is very beneficial to both the game itself and the players, so we often find such designs in games. Specifically, we can explore from two aspects:</p>
<h3 id="Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface"><a href="#Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Game-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Improve the Quality of the Game Interface"></a>Improve the Quality of the Game Interface</h3><p>On the one hand, for the game itself, the design of the skeuomorphic interface can combine the interface with simulated real elements and carry out artistic processing to form an interface design that meets the psychological needs of players. Through skeuomorphic design, it enhances the efficient matching of game interface information. At the same time, the exquisite and artistic design can also enhance the quality of the interface, easily express the theme of the work, and integrate with the game world. </p>

In <em>The Last of Us</em>, the information is connected with the game plot scene, and the map is placed in the player’s audience and scene. This skeuomorphic method is used to enhance the player’s sense of substitution and immersion. </p>

How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?"></a>3. How to Make the Interface in the Game More Realistic and Friendly?</h2><p>Skeuomorphic design can make the game interface more vivid, but if it is not designed properly, it will also lead to low adaptability, interface discordance, inability to present effective information, and other problems. Therefore, in the process of skeuomorphic design, designers should pay attention to:</p>
<h3 id="Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality"><a href="#Skeuomorphic-Elements-Associated-with-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality"></a>Skeuomorphic Elements Associated with Reality</h3><p>The skeuomorphic interface design should simulate object elements that are more in line with the player’s psychological cognition, reduce learning costs, and allow players to naturally integrate into the game. In the interface design of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, the game combines the collection of cars with the display form of menus, allowing players to view the collected models by flipping through different menus. Through the element form of the real menu, players are more receptive to the collection of items, and the presentation of the interface is also more vivid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F2b11bb7a-ce70-47a3-8285-1a3d40d35f96.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In the skill page of <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, the overall interface is designed in the form of stone rubbings, making the overall interface present a heavy effect. Players are like carving on a slate when upgrading skills and equipment, creating a more realistic feeling. In the equipment interface, each weapon has its own exclusive skeuomorphic background. For example, the Blades of Chaos uses the texture of the blade and lava to show the weapon characteristics; while the UI background of the Leviathan Axe shows the frozen attributes. Such a design helps players have a more intuitive and clear understanding of the weapon’s attributes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F9e09de5b-1dd9-48f4-b292-96b85a3becd5.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%26nbsp%3B%20%0A%21%5B%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fe6786c28-1cda-463b-ba63-644b8d2c177a.png/size/"></p>

The yellowish letters and books reflect the mysterious and retro magical colors in the game, and also conform to the background of the times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5bcb1245-f1af-4e3e-b52e-9edf17c88b33.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>《Hogwarts Legacy》 Interface</em></p>

<p>In <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, a skeuomorphic design that is very consistent with the theme of the game is also selected. In the interface, the form of Atreus’s old books, notebooks, and sketches is used to show the characters, worldview, plot, etc. of the game, which not only fits the theme of the game, but also strengthens the texture and style of the game, rendering the immersive atmosphere of the player’s game. Players are like opening a notepad, reading their own past. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2Fba6c00d9-bb77-4edd-8d9c-ab067b719bed.jpg/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>The Sinking City</em> also uses the elements of old and damaged notebooks, which fits the theme of detective games. The yellowish notebook shows various information in the game, allowing players to feel full of suspense and enhance the player’s detective experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F475a2e02-5e5f-485e-8478-d6d7fcd13bf4.png/size/"></p>

In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, the game combines the interface for purchasing items with the scene, allowing players to complete the purchase of items by flipping through the books in the scene, as if they were cowboys in that era, using ancient methods to obtain information about guns, and then selecting and placing orders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F5d740af2-4c45-4442-9aef-02dfb470fa89.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, the interface information is very cleverly combined with the items in the game, and the information prompts are integrated into the scene. The scattering of dandelion text brings a good visual experience to the player. Integrating the interface into the scene cannot appear isolated and abrupt, but should be designed in combination with the current scene, gameplay, etc. of the game, so that this combination is not far-fetched and does not jump out of the scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F397fa426-0c58-407a-86ab-8d66496fd565.png/size/"></p>

Therefore, in addition to the external decoration of skeuomorphism, the skeuomorphic design of the player’s operation method is its deeper penetration.</p>
<p>In <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, the interface is combined with the electronic screen in the game, connecting information with the scene and placing the interface in the game, making the overall scene produce a more three-dimensional sense of space, and the integration with the scene is also more harmonious and unified. Players seem to be clicking on a control screen, and they are also brought into this virtual world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230724%2F2522fed2-e641-48ff-82fc-da55de9d7a8b.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>Dead Space</em> very cleverly integrates the UI with characters and scenes, realizing a deeper exploration of skeuomorphism. The UI interface is completely integrated with the game characters. The character’s health bar in the game can be viewed from the glowing body on the character’s back; while the real-time information of the game is displayed through the character’s hologram in the game. Through the internal UI interface of the scene, the overall game is presented more unified, complete, and real; it also makes the UI, characters, and scenes have a strong connection. Players will not feel detached during the game, and can fully devote themselves to the horror atmosphere. </p>

Therefore, in the design, attention should also be paid to using skeuomorphism to build the hierarchical relationship of the page. For example, in <em>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</em>, cards and notebooks are used to unfold the plot, and the page hierarchy is constructed through the plane relationship, front and back occlusion relationship, color light and shadow of the objects in this skeuomorphic interface, and with the help of book page turning. </p>

By simulating things and operation methods familiar to players, it can often allow players to quickly accept the game settings and substitute into the entire atmosphere. Skeuomorphic design not only conforms to various whimsical ideas in the game, but also enhances the player’s immersive experience, so it is widely used in many games. If you lack inspiration in design, you may consider referring to various clues in the real world, carrying out skeuomorphic design, and creating a more realistic and friendly interface!</p>

    <title>When Games Meet Dopamine Dressing, How to Create Double Happiness</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are a frequent internet user or pay attention to fashion, you should have heard the buzzword “dopamine dressing” recently. In the WeChat index statistics, on a certain day in June alone, the entry for dopamine dressing exceeded 100 million times, with a day-on-day increase of more than 20%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F15e3af35-e3ac-472c-a2ea-4e26edd8f02d.png/size/"></p>
<p>For this seemingly mystifying new term, there are various definitions and descriptions on social media. Generally speaking, fashionable outfits that can effectively improve the wearer’s mood is the so-called “dopamine dressing”, which comes from fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released by the brain when a person receives pleasure. Most of the dopamine dressing currently popular online also conveys an optimistic and positive concept to people through simple color psychology. Psychologist Karen Pine said in her book “Mind What You Wear: The Psychology of Fashion” that “what we wear greatly affects how we feel, and even changes our thoughts and judgments.” Some scholars call it “enclothed cognition” and found that our outfits can have symbolic meanings that affect psychology and performance. Therefore, whether you want a colorful, sexy or just comfortable look, the most important thing is to wear clothes that make us feel happy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fb2ce3f37-329f-4842-9e77-f84bdb2ab17f.png/size/"></p>
<p>The popularity of dopamine dressing also shows that many people, especially young people, are eager to find their own happiness.</p>
<p>So, in games that also produce a lot of dopamine, what kind of wonderful chemical reaction will the two have?</p>
<p>In fact, in many games, there is such a large group of players with online aesthetics who pay more attention to or like to appreciate the appearance of skins in the game, generally called “appearance-oriented players”; among them, there are also many powerful players who have the hobby of collecting game skins. There are many reasons why they love game skins. On the one hand, the game art caters to their preferences; on the other hand, trying different styles, colors and even skins of different genders in the virtual world can give people a refreshing experience. What attracts them may be to show off their cool fashion special effects, maybe the exaggerated and alternative styles they dare not try in reality, or even the gender-breaking dressing experience.</p>
<p>With the recent popularity of the concept of “dopamine dressing” on social media, people have found that changing clothes and color matching can bring a sense of pleasure, and many players have also shown off their in-game dopamine dressing on social media. Combining the psychological principles of dopamine dressing, we analyze some core points of game dopamine dressing.</p>
<h2 id="1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games"><a href="#1-Dopamine-Dressing-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Dopamine Dressing in Games"></a>1. Dopamine Dressing in Games</h2><h3 id="Color-Matching-is-a-Science"><a href="#Color-Matching-is-a-Science" class="headerlink" title="Color Matching is a Science"></a>Color Matching is a Science</h3><p>The first principle of dopamine dressing is to trigger positive emotions in oneself and those around them by emphasizing the visual impact brought by colors. The core is to make colors bring people a sense of happiness, comfort and confidence.</p>
<p>In terms of color matching, it is more common to stack skins with similar tones to produce a uniform effect. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players can find multiple pleasures and a sense of belonging through fashion and social interaction by dressing in the same color series as other friends. In these dopamine outfits shared by players, black is mysterious, green is natural and fresh, red is joyful and festive, and blue is cold and quiet. </p>

<hr>
<p>In addition, although contrasting color combinations are risky, they sometimes have surprising visual effects. For example, in the dopamine dressing shared by <em>Justice Online</em> players, the dark-toned male character fashion and the bright-toned female character walking together also create a wonderful sense of contrast. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F89745f03-82c8-439b-8704-800fe89a0efc.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF"><a href="#Background-Accessories-are-the-Strongest-BUFF" class="headerlink" title="Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF"></a>Background Accessories are the Strongest BUFF</h3><p>From the examples in the figure above, it is not difficult to notice that in order to achieve a better visual unity effect, not only can the character’s fashion be matched with the same color series as much as possible, but the scene and accessories are also quite particular. For example, in the black fashion, the player chose the background of the dark night roof. The green outfit is matched with mountain waterfalls and green leaf embellishments. In the red outfit, the character holds Spring Festival couplets to add atmosphere. The blue outfit is on the ice and is accompanied by a “cold” expression. In order to enhance the emotional stimulation effect, many users will add a circle of emoticons of corresponding colors or emotions around the characters to make the picture more vivid and lively, and have an atmosphere. This is especially important when players take screenshots or photos to share.</p>
<h3 id="Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password"><a href="#Multiple-Dressing-Effects-are-the-Traffic-Password" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password"></a>Multiple Dressing Effects are the Traffic Password</h3><p>This type of video shared by players on social media adopts the common stepping-on-the-beat dressing form of short videos, emphasizing the dynamic effect of the picture, and the picture feeling and emotional stimulation are very direct. With excellent fashion, it is easier to amaze the viewers. Rhythm control is also one of the important elements that determine whether the dopamine dressing video is attractive. Some will match the background music with a strong sense of rhythm to match the picture, and some will use the seven days of the week as the switching node. “One change a day” gives people a stronger sense of substitution. </p>

For example, the Terracotta Army, in fact, their original colors when they were just unearthed were very rich. There were 8 colors in total, including red, green, black, white, blue, purple, yellow, and pink, with nearly 20 shades on different parts of the clothing. These colored pigments came from various minerals or plants in nature, and the color matching was also very bold and avant-garde. There are also a few synthetic materials in the pigments, such as “Chinese purple”, “lead white” and “lead red”, which are considered to be artificially made.</p>
<p>It is understood that scientists first discovered barium copper silicate on Han Dynasty pottery in 1992 and called it “Han purple”. Later, it was found that it was widely used on the Qin Terracotta Army, so it is now generally called “Chinese purple”. The thousands of faces of the Terracotta Army are also vivid and lively due to the “dopamine” color dressing under the careful dressing of ancient craftsmen. Chinese purple is also used by some game art designers to extract design inspiration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2Fb69055f1-a5ad-466e-b634-16e3d47a72f1.png/size/"></p>
<p>The “dopamine dressing” style of the Han Dynasty was based on classical elegance. Hanfu and Han etiquette showed the elegance in the hearts of Chinese people. The main colors of clothing were white, khaki, and brown, embellished with red and pink.</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty had a broad vision, broad mind and open attitude in terms of political and economic systems, culture and art, and social atmosphere. It absorbed foreign cultures, innovated and developed, and led China into a new era. The Tang Sancai human figurines preserved in many museums in Shaanxi also show the popular “dopamine” dressing at that time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F35ea4bc8-264b-4a63-b086-0f68cb372119.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>“Clothes are wrapped in clouds and mist, and fairy music saves all beings.” In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the image of Longmen Feitian is perfectly restored on the character. The golden璎珞, 帔帛, the drooping clothes, and the color matching of pink, green and red have high recognition and excellent visual presentation effects, which can fully mobilize the positive emotions of players, and at the same time show the traditional Chinese culture, tracing back thousands of years, and presenting history to the world in a new look. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230726%2F3354cac8-c14b-40ef-a87c-ffde0fdb6149.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Whether it is dopamine dressing in reality or fashion matching in games, it is a new way for people to express healthy, positive and optimistic concepts. “Dopamine dressing” may be just one of the many concepts that have quickly become popular with the help of social media, but its diversified expression in various carriers, such as the combination with video games, also gives more people the courage to show their personality and preferences.</p>

    <title>The Rise of UGC - How Can Grassroots Creators Become Big Trees</title>
    <url>/2023/08/02/netease-ux-articles/news_20230807_28584_1103302/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230807/28584_1103302.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the global sweep of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> to <em>Fortnite’s</em> UEFN editor becoming a recent hit, the importance of UGC in the gaming field is increasing day by day. Many domestic and foreign game manufacturers have entered the game, either implementing editors in the game or providing level design activities, providing players with a series of level editing tools, allowing players to give full play to their creativity. This form of players being both content consumers and creators may become a major trend in the future development of games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fd5e697fc-6397-4ac5-a8b9-ac617b27bdcb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>PUBG Mobile launched the creator mode “World of Wonder”, where players can freely build maps&#x2F;modes</em></p>
<p>At the same time, according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, players spend nearly half of their game time playing in the worlds created in Fortnite Creative, and some creators even earn a lot of income by helping commercial companies build custom worlds in <em>Fortnite</em>. Players’ desire and enthusiasm for UGC content can also be seen.</p>
<p>Among the endless player works, the creative masters among the players have attracted a lot of attention. Many well-known game media or game officials have interviewed them to explore the creative process and design inspiration of these players. There is no doubt that the stories of top creators can inspire developers and motivate onlookers, but they are still not enough for us to understand the entire UGC player ecosystem.</p>
<p>From the KOL pyramid model, ordinary UGC players (mid-tail + long-tail) are a large number of creators. What are the similarities and differences between them and top creators? What is their current situation? What are their demands? There is very little research and discussion at present. We contacted some players of popular UGC games on the market, hoping to provide some clues on how to tap and maintain this group of players with a large base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F54901c5d-686f-4bc4-a61a-52e9efda6e3c.png/size/"></p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Opportunity-for-Ordinary-UGC-Players-to-Start-Creating-What-is-the-Creative-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?"></a>1. What is the Opportunity for Ordinary UGC Players to Start Creating? What is the Creative Idea?</h2><p>Strawberry is a college student player who entered Roblox last year, but only started to try the editor this year. “Every time I log in, I will see the popular maps on the homepage. When I play those, I want to replicate a similar map.” Coincidentally, Green Wine, a veteran player of <em>Minecraft</em>, also has similar ideas. “I always see visual feast maps on Bilibili. The color matching is very good. I think it’s amazing. I also want to try to make a map of my own.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fb7d106aa-7438-4b56-9b0f-d8366786dfdb.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Visual Feast</em></p>
<p>Or attracted by the popularity, similar to shooting Douyin&#x2F;posting on Weibo, they will follow the trend to post popular theme content or bring popular topic tags. Many ordinary UGC players “want to be able to make very popular works themselves, and want more people to like them. This may be the same as the current popular hotspots. No one will like a static model. Everyone wants to try popular things.” Trying to make similar UGC content to ride the trend has become the starting point of their creative path.</p>
<p>In addition, wanting to make maps for friends&#x2F;partners to check in and play together is also one of the opportunities for some players to start creating. Landscape check-in works are more common. Many players want to use the game editor as a carrier to create a place for themselves and their friends to leave memories&#x2F;commemorations. “The opportunity to start making maps is to make a commemorative map that can be played with friends, because when I play some maps with novel and beautiful scenery, it is worth checking in, so I want to create a commemorative map in my mind.” Similar to sandbox game players and MMO home players, these UGC creators hope to build homes or internet celebrity scenic spots, pursuing love &amp; peace. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F98679b75-3f73-401c-bbb8-be1b955c472b.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Dutch Windmill Village in Minecraft</em></p>
<p>Some creators also hope to make maps with stronger interaction, or create game levels that can be played together with friends, or make prank maps to see friends’ funny and frustrated reactions. “The opportunity is that I often go to play other people’s maps, so I want to make a map for my partners to play. At first, I wanted to make something for viewing, but if it is only for viewing and has no playability, I will add some gameplay.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F5fe1afcf-44f2-4bc3-a84a-0a848b3c8475.png/size/"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that there are a group of players who have the idea of ​​trying it themselves after seeing beautiful and amazing, or unique and fresh high-heat UGC content on social media. And their creative inspiration, or the idea of ​​starting to create, more or less revolves around one word - replication (imitation), either imitating the works of others, or moving reality into the game.</p>
<p>This is easy to understand. Compared with creating from scratch, replication has a clearer and more visible creative object, and the sense of goal will be relatively stronger, so that it will not be abandoned at the beginning; secondly, the “creation” threshold of replication is low, and the probability of success is high. You can feel the fun of creation and the sense of accomplishment in a short time. Many players can also make micro-innovations on the basis of replication, draw inferences from one another, and the investment cost is relatively low.</p>
<p>In addition, many creative novices enjoy the creative process, similar to the handmade circle. Seeing beautiful and interesting handicrafts (wool felt, cream glue, tufting, etc.), they will also want to follow the tutorial to make it themselves, and feel the fun of handmade DIY. “I started making maps because I thought YEET A PET was very interesting, so I wanted to try to make it myself, and then I slowly figured out some rules of the editor,” said Lemon Tea, a Roblox player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F7996b687-7fea-40b4-95c9-2180f4768008.png/size/"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Popular Roblox Game, “YEET A PET”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been increasingly confirmed after asking them about their creative ideas and creative bottlenecks. The creative ideas of these players have obvious commonalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of gameplay type design, most of them are based on cross-border reference, such as landscape check-in, escape room, haunted house, LARP, and so on. The specific level design is also not innovative from scratch, but draws inspiration from reality (variety shows, film and television dramas, novels, lyrics, etc.) or other games</li>
<li>The art style is also mostly following the trend, with real life (buildings&#x2F;natural scenery and other landscapes, IP images in other fields, etc.) and official season styles being sources of inspiration</li>
<li>Or follow the current hot spots, and wait for top creators to research and develop new gameplay&#x2F;new art styles, and then follow the trend to gradually form a trend</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that their ideas are not creative enough, but that they think it is difficult to materialize the ideas out of thin air. “I have a lot of ideas, but I just can’t make them.” This is mostly limited by the breadth and depth of their use of tools.</p>
<p>For ordinary creators, the introduction and use of UGC tools often “borrow” ideas from top creators. Regarding tool usage skills (how to use advanced tools, how to combine tools, what kind of finished products can be made with XX tools, what functions can improve the efficiency of mapping, etc.), they usually need to provide a problem-solving idea, or have examples to explain the principle of tool use, absorb + use it from practice, so as to draw inferences from one another, and adapt&#x2F;create new content themselves.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players"><a href="#2-What-are-the-Difficulties-Faced-by-Ordinary-UGC-Players" class="headerlink" title="2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?"></a>2. What are the Difficulties Faced by Ordinary UGC Players?</h2><p>Similar to top creators, the motivation for ordinary UGC players to continue creating is mostly the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Fun] Creating results with their own hands, experiencing the fun and sense of accomplishment of creation</li>
<li>[Recognition] Continuously gaining likes and recognition from the public, and resonating with everyone through their works</li>
<li>[Opportunity] Gaining recognition and support from the official, thereby further expanding their influence</li>
<li>[Reward] Discovering actual material rewards &amp; income opportunities (such as providing customized services, becoming a social media KOL)</li>
<li>[Community belonging] Making new friends during the creative process, often conducting friendly exchanges and discussions, and generating a sense of community belongin.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png807%2F9cd1bdfe-50d6-4b2f-b790-1055bb6694c7.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the process of constantly contacting creators, we also found that, in addition to generating electricity for love, ordinary UGC players are more motivated by the support and encouragement of the audience and fans, as well as the monetization opportunities they seek, to overcome difficulties and improve their creations.</p>
<p>Although the long-lasting incentives of the platform and the occasional stories of popular authors have “tempted” many players to enter the circle, in fact, players have also noticed that “it’s not our turn”, “winning the competition is only because of traffic, there must be gold buried. Like the famous gods now, the popular maps are always made by the same people, and the usual map push traffic is also very poor, no one comes to play, there is really no motivation.” The feeling of pouring out all their enthusiasm makes ordinary creators with a small fan base feel more and more difficult to get ahead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F8c7972db-7800-4272-8e1e-1c7bc14c4b9f.png/size/"><br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F825c0085-9256-430d-9fbb-01c80f86c131.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic"><a href="#Most-UGC-games-will-hold-competitions-launch-creator-support-plans-but-ordinary-players-are-usually-discouraged-by-the-evaluation-criteria-of-traffic" class="headerlink" title="Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic"></a><em>Most UGC games will hold competitions&#x2F;launch creator support plans, but ordinary players are usually discouraged by the evaluation criteria of traffic</em></h2><p>On the one hand, aside from players who only care about the fun of creation, ordinary creators often face the dilemma of entering the game late and finding it difficult to get ahead. Unlike the top creators at the top of the pyramid, they have relied on continuous themes and content innovation, coupled with personal characteristics, and finally have an unshakable position in the subdivided field. However, ordinary creators are limited by the shrinking blue ocean theme field, and they also lack the ability to use tools, and they don’t know where to start to create content with their own characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, game UGC, as a content creation track, most of the UGC content recommendation systems in the game are not much different from the operation ideas of external vertical communities. The platform and top creators have a “symbiotic relationship”, and the platform’s traffic will unconsciously tilt towards the top. First, in terms of commercial realization, top creators are an important bargaining chip for the platform, and the platform will also give top creators more monetization opportunities. Secondly, in terms of user ecology, top creators can help the platform attract new users and stimulate user activity with strong and distinctive content creation, and the platform can be more inclined to top creators in terms of recommendation algorithms. Therefore, in the content ecosystem created by the platform, the status of creators in different circles of the pyramid is very different. The higher you go, the harder it is to break the barriers between circles.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>UGC has become a new trend in the development of the game industry. However, in addition to relying on the guidance and drive of top creators, ordinary players are also an indispensable part of this ecology. Therefore, how to bring high-quality, high-potential maps to consumer players, how to make ordinary creators stand out, continuously supplement and support creators, and avoid the phenomenon of monopoly or lack of successors, is a long-term operation problem that UGC game manufacturers urgently need to consider.</p>

    <title>Immersive, Role-Playing, or Spectating - How Character Involvement Affects Your Purchase of Game Cosmetics</title>
    <url>/2023/07/28/netease-ux-articles/news_20230807_28584_1103304/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230807/28584_1103304.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In RPG games, you usually play a certain character in the game, and this character brings you into a brand new virtual world.</p>
<p>By taking on this role, you can explore this virtual world, interact with other NPCs, experience various ups and downs, twists and turns of stories and adventures; constantly think about various puzzles in the game, find the best solution, promote the development of the game plot, and obtain various upgrades of the character.</p>
<h2 id="1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#1-Immersion-vs-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>1. Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating</h2><p>The game protagonist played by the player usually has two typical images, one is immersive, and the other is a blank slate.</p>
<h3 id="Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion"><a href="#Immersive-Protagonist-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)"></a>Immersive Protagonist (Immersion)</h3><p>Most of the earliest RPG games had immersive protagonists.</p>
<p>This kind of protagonist has unique character settings and thinking modes, and the game plot will also deeply portray their background stories, character relationships, and personality traits. The protagonist will express their likes and dislikes, opinions, and actively take many actions in various event dialogues. Players cannot change the appearance and name of the protagonist, such as Li Xiaoyao in “Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy” and Link in “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”. When playing this type of game, the player’s experience is closer to interactive movies and TV.</p>
<p>Another type of immersive protagonist is the character that can be switched into during the game process, such as in “Revelation M”. Players can switch into other characters to explore the map and battle, and these characters also have unique personalities and backgrounds. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa83fb212-a71d-4477-a193-cfb0067dfd48.png/size/" alt="《Chinese Paladin: Sword and Fairy》 RPG series game first generation"></p>
<h3 id="Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Blank-Slate-Protagonist-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)"></a>Blank Slate Protagonist (Role-Playing vs Spectating)</h3><p>The biggest feature of this type of character is the lack of personality. The background story line is complete but rarely portrayed; they rarely express opinions in plot dialogues, and even if there are opinions, there are branch options. Many characters do not have voice acting, such as Lumine in “Genshin Impact”. Everyone knows that she is a traveler from a foreign land, but it is difficult to say what kind of person she is.</p>
<p>An American cartoonist, Scott McCloud’s, point is that “the fewer details a character has, the more likely readers are to project themselves into that character.” Many games now allow players to customize the appearance attributes of the protagonist, such as face customization, hair dyeing, and even body customization, but they still cannot provide customized personal plots for all types of “player avatars”. Therefore, blank slate protagonists usually cannot have obvious personality traits.</p>
<p>The original intention of the blank slate protagonist is to allow players to immerse themselves in the game world. But in actual contact with players, we found that among the blank slate protagonists, a large number of players do not immerse themselves in the role, whether it is an MMORPG that emphasizes the experience of the virtual world or an otome game that emphasizes immersion.</p>
<p>For example, in MMORPGs, many male players choose to play female characters, not because they want to experience the plot or battle from the perspective of a female character, but simply because they think the female character is better-looking. In otome games, many female players do not substitute themselves for the protagonist and date the virtual characters, but use the protagonist’s eyes as a camera, go through the plot, and watch the relationships, just like reading a novel or watching a drama. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F44b30c9a-1722-4d02-ad36-0f661cee3d45.png/size/" alt="Selection interface in Justice Online mobile game."></p>
<p>These types of players can be called spectator-perspective players.</p>
<p>The spectator perspective has no personality characteristics and no character restrictions. The protagonist can be imagined as anyone. For example, adult players will choose to play loli characters and raise them as daughters, while male players playing female characters may project the expected female personality and appearance.</p>
<p>Immersion vs Role-Playing vs Spectating, to put it simply, immersion is to experience the love, hate, and stories of someone else; Role-Playing is to put yourself in the role of the protagonist and personally experience the joys and sorrows of this world; Spectating is to use the perspective of the protagonist as a camera to observe the stories that happen in this world, and the protagonist has little to do with the story itself.</p>
<h2 id="2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions"><a href="#2-Different-Ways-of-Involvement-Completely-Different-Cosmetic-Purchase-Decisions" class="headerlink" title="2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions"></a>2. Different Ways of Involvement, Completely Different Cosmetic Purchase Decisions</h2><p>Different game protagonists’ self-involvement methods not only affect the player’s plot experience, but more interestingly, we found that these three involvement methods will have completely different effects on the player’s fashion purchase decisions.</p>
<h3 id="Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes"><a href="#Immersion-Brings-Added-Value-to-Fashion-Themes" class="headerlink" title="Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes"></a>Immersion Brings Added Value to Fashion Themes</h3><p>Take the two dress-up games “Shining Nikki” and “Life Makeover” as examples:</p>
<p>“Shining Nikki” adopts a typical immersive protagonist. There is a very vivid description of Nikki on the Internet. “Su Nikki, an ordinary person who can’t help staying up late and likes to hum even though she sings out of tune, is enthusiastic to everyone and comes to a strange world. Watching the world collapse in front of her, she constantly tries to save the world several times. Facing the separation from her parents and the betrayal of her friends, she can still be kind and full of vitality.”</p>
<p>“Life Makeover” uses a blank slate protagonist. Players can personalize the name, face, and even height and body shape of the protagonist. As for the protagonist herself, her background story also revolves around her sister. Her sister is a private detective, and there is very little description of the protagonist herself.</p>
<p>The advantage of the blank slate protagonist is that it can meet more diverse needs of substitution or viewing, but it is also difficult to generate empathy due to the lack of character details and distinct personality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Angel and Devil set PV on the first anniversary of “Shining Nikki” became popular and resonated with many old Nikki players, who returned to the game; the main point of popularity was the plot. This set of clothes was given special meaning by the plot, so many people empathized and collected it. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F7f160228-3f16-40a9-ab49-91991d91cb33.png/size/" alt="Fan-made rendition of Shining Nikki’s Angel and Devil set that commemorates its first anniversary."></p>
<p>The first six-star limited-time set of “Life Makeover” - Snow Heavy Glory, although there is also a high-quality fashion PV, on social platforms, most people’s attention is only on whether the fashion is beautiful, and few people pay attention to the theme story behind the fashion. For many people, it is just a beautiful six-star appearance. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F0c511e02-d45e-48a4-ab56-b995184cf3bc.png/size/" alt="Life Makeover’s first limited-time set, Snow Heavy Glory."></p>
<p>In game fashion design, the theme is a very important part. Like “Shining Nikki”, the plot can give clothes a special meaning, making many people empathize and collect them, bringing added value to fashion.</p>
<p>In MMO games, the protagonist is usually a blank slate, and the theme value of game fashion is often completed through collaboration, which is the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>For example, the Little Prince and Rose set, which has high sales in “Revelation M”, is based on the classic plot of The Little Prince; when the double ponytail was just launched, many players also began to cosplay Sailor Moon. Recently, the Green Snake set, which is very popular in “Justice Online Mobile”, its interactive action is a restoration of a very classic scene in the movie Green Snake, making players exclaim: It’s so thematic. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fd22e9db0-07c5-4ea1-b89b-028aa2dc27e1.png.%20%0A%20%0A%0A%21%5BThe%20Green%20Snake%20Set%20in%20Justice%20Online%20Mobile.%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa079a928-332a-4568-82df-84b2a03b8712.png/size/" alt="The Little Prince and the Rose Set in Revelation Mobile."></p>
<p>In the above two cases, the added value of the theme to fashion is achieved through the immersive perspective.</p>
<p>In MMO games, if the theme is to give fashion special meaning, first of all, this theme must have a three-dimensional&#x2F;highly recognizable character, and be accompanied by an attractive plot, such as the Little Prince, Green Snake, Fa Hai, etc. Simply giving fashion a theme plot atmosphere without character setting, it is difficult for players to empathize and collect. In addition, it is also necessary to consider the role that players want to substitute, for example, in the theme of Journey to the West, female players will definitely want to substitute the Jade Rabbit, not Sun Wukong.</p>
<h3 id="Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating"><a href="#Fashion-Choices-for-Role-Playing-vs-Spectating" class="headerlink" title="Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating"></a>Fashion Choices for Role-Playing vs Spectating</h3><p>Players who substitute themselves generally choose the same gender role. When going through the plot or participating in game activities, in order to better substitute into the plot situation, they often dress themselves up and wear fashion that matches the plot to go through the plot. This is more obvious in the Japanese player research. More Japanese players are substituting themselves when playing MMO games. Fashion matching the theme of the expansion pack can attract these players, and they are also more likely to buy fashion because they want to participate in the plot or activities of the expansion pack. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fb48377de-0771-4f70-8226-f2c62a450911.jpg/size/" alt="The “Tide Light” faction fashion of “Justice Online”&#39;s large-scale expansion pack “Bihai Chaoguang”."></p>
<p>For spectator players, since the character has no obvious personality characteristics under the spectator perspective, players do not substitute themselves, and there are no restrictions on fixed character settings. They can easily imagine the protagonist as anyone, and switch between protagonists of different genders and ages without burden. At the same time, they also have no fixed character choice constraints, and there is no pressure to switch between different styles of characters. This part of the players will have more diverse choices.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the lack of substitution needs, fashion launched in conjunction with the plot and activities of the expansion pack may not necessarily empower fashion. For these players, choosing beautiful clothes to go through the plot is a higher priority than choosing suitable clothes to go through the plot. They project the personality and appearance of the male&#x2F;female they expect in their hearts onto the character. Therefore, in terms of fashion choices, they are more inclined to styles that meet their own group or other groups’ expectations and preferences. For example, in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in China, fairy and sexy are ranked at the top, while in the research on the temperament preferences of adult female fashion in Japan, gentleness is ranked at the top. This is also relatively close to the personality expectations of adult women in different social environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>Immersion is experiencing the story, substitution is personal experience, and viewing is observing the story. The relationship between different involvement methods and fashion is: In blank slate character games, players who substitute and players who view need to be treated differently. Players who substitute are more suitable for designing theme role-playing fashion, and viewers pay more attention to the beauty and universal aesthetics of fashion. The same is the immersive way of involvement. The theme gives fashion highly recognizable characters and attractive plots. For example, collaborating with other themes outside the game can give fashion a deeper meaning and purchase attraction.</p>

    <title>Motivation + Ability + Prompt - How Does the Fogg Model Guide Player Behavior</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230807/28584_1103305.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model"><a href="#1-What-is-the-Fogg-Behavior-Model" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?"></a>1. What is the Fogg Behavior Model?</h2><p>The Fogg Behavior Model was proposed by Dr. BJ Fogg, founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. The Fogg Behavior Model states that three elements must converge simultaneously for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of these three elements is missing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The degree of desire to perform a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Ability:</strong> The ease or difficulty of completing a certain behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt:</strong> The incentives and feedback that trigger a certain behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be explained in a diagram. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F4c2d7e7d-8adb-46e4-b2bf-e8bd9e77b5a1.png/size/"></p>
<p>The essence of interaction design is the design of user behavior. The Fogg Model, as a classic user psychology model, can be said to be one of the underlying logics of interaction design and has important guiding significance for interaction design.</p>
<p>The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) makes it easier to understand behavior in general. It highlights three main elements, each with subcomponents. Specifically, the FBM outlines the core motivators (motivation), simplicity factors (ability), and types of prompts. The subcomponents define the larger elements; for example, in the FBM, the word <em>ability</em> refers to how simplicity factors work together in the context of prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Ff6956b2a-6f2d-4449-b15e-2c254b2c0471.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h3><p>Unlike psychologists who advocate for extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, Professor Fogg divides the sources of motivation into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensation (physical level):</strong> Essentially, sensation is driven by our pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. Some behaviors bring us pain (behaviors we want to avoid), some behaviors bring us pleasure (behaviors that motivate us to continue), and sometimes multiple motivations conflict with each other, leading to our mental anguish (such as wanting to lose weight but also wanting to eat high-calorie foods).</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation (emotional level):</strong> The benefits that can be obtained or the punishments that can be avoided by taking action (which can correspond to extrinsic motivation in psychology). For example, hope and fear are the most powerful motivators, making people yearn to be part of something very meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging (social level):</strong> This makes people feel that they are part of society, and this sense of belonging keeps them motivated. For example, all your friends are doing it (which corresponds to extrinsic motivation in psychology).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, motivation itself is constantly changing and very unstable. Therefore, in specific design, we can prioritize solving ability and prompt issues to improve the behavior conversion rate of motivated users. Secondly, we should seize the peak of user motivation to guide users to perform corresponding behaviors, rather than converting after the user’s motivation drops. When motivation is high, people can do difficult things, but once motivation declines, people will only complete easy things.</p>
<h3 id="Ability-Cost"><a href="#Ability-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Ability&#x2F;Cost"></a>Ability&#x2F;Cost</h3><p>The horizontal axis of the Fogg Model is ability, from “hard to do” to “easy to do.” Professor Fogg believes that people have a natural tendency to be lazy. Therefore, although people can be trained to perform target behaviors, it is usually more effective to make the behavior easy. In addition, he believes that what users care about most is cost. Instead of increasing his motivation to do something with more temptation, it is better to think about reducing the cost of doing it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F0c28bd6e-6c58-4fca-b9fc-d0bfd0fbd40b.png/size/"></p>
<p>In games, the player’s ability is reflected in the hero level, the player’s moves and abilities in the game, the amount of currency and items they have, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="Prompt"><a href="#Prompt" class="headerlink" title="Prompt"></a>Prompt</h3><p>The hardest thing in the world is “doing the right thing at the right time.” For promoting conversion, it is “persuading users to do what they can with the right motivation at the right time.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2Fa5df5077-c0e5-4794-896f-12c9a6ae9578.png/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> When users do not have enough motivation, they need to be stimulated with explanatory text or videos to generate motivation, such as limited-time free items, discounts, and novice prizes for new users in the store.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitator:</strong> When users already have enough motivation, but sometimes they don’t know how to do it, they need help to complete the conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> When users have both the motivation to do it and know how to do it, what they need is a reminder at the right time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful conversion occurs when motivation is strong and implementation costs are low, which is above the threshold in the figure above. But sometimes, strong motivation and low cost cannot be fully satisfied. At this time, it is necessary to ensure that there is no design with high cost and insufficient user motivation.</p>

<li><strong>Increase player motivation - Reward distribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Providing a reward preview in the task interface allows players to know the specific rewards they can obtain by completing the task, thereby increasing players’ motivation to complete the task. Players often complete tasks they didn’t originally intend to do because they want specific rewards.</p>
<p>At the same time, since the motivation and ability required to stimulate player behavior are two complementary factors, when setting awards, it is also necessary to set the size of the reward according to the difficulty of the task. When a task is difficult, setting a reward of sufficiently high value can motivate players to take action. </p>

<li><strong>Provide external motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The most common external motivations in games are various medals, rewards, and leaderboards. These rewards are not only a reward for players’ activity in the game, but also an external motivation to encourage players to improve their abilities and continue to be active in the game, prompting players to obtain these badges out of the mentality of “I want what others have.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F6af6b63f-6d88-42f9-8316-0405dc7e13eb.png/size/"></p>

<p>Just like shopping in daily life, when we see something that many people buy, we always can’t help but take a second look, and our desire to consume is higher. In the design of the store page, highlighting hot-selling products is also a way to increase players’ sense of belonging and stimulate consumption. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F517f816f-4734-4b22-a817-a9682e6d2e66.png/size/"></p>

<p>Increase the scarcity of goods - things are more valuable when they are rare. People always focus on what they will lose, not what they will get. When we see a limited-time discount in our shopping cart, we usually feel a sense of urgency that we are about to lose the opportunity to pick up a bargain. This mentality is also used in some game stores, using a combination of discounts and limited-time sales to stimulate player consumption. </p>

<li><strong>Reduce the difficulty of behavior by breaking down tasks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“By focusing on Simplicity of the target behavior you increase Ability.” Simplifying the target behavior is the process of empowering users.</p>
<p>Breaking down tasks into steps and guiding players to complete them is a common way to guide players to complete tasks step by step. In novice tasks, it is also common to gradually break down the tasks to guide players to accumulate experience. By turning some high-cost behaviors, such as completing tasks with larger goals, into small steps, and supplemented by different completion incentives, users can unknowingly accumulate a lot of successful experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230807%2F2e322d0a-1a08-48dd-b083-6a09ec4cf7e8.png/size/"></p>

<li><strong>Increase players’ ability to complete tasks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When players first enter a game, there is usually a novice guidance process to help players quickly understand the gameplay of the game and improve players’ abilities in the game. Whether the novice guidance can truly enable players to master the operation methods and gameplay of the game is also an important factor that determines whether players can stay in the game in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Small details to guide players to new information in the game - red dot prompts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Red dot prompts are a basic guiding method widely used in interaction design. For example, the various new message prompts in the apps we see most often in our lives use a small red dot to prompt users to open the message box to view messages, which also applies users’ obsessive-compulsive disorder psychology to a certain extent.</p>
<p>When a new costume is added to a hero, the red dot prompts at all levels of the path can ensure that players can accurately find the newly launched costume among the many pieces of information, thereby prompting players to try it on and purchase it. Including game updates, in-game event updates, and gameplay opening prompts, etc., can also be used in this simple way to guide players to participate in new activities in the game. </p>

<hr>
<p>Limited-time open gameplay prompt - <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s “Realm of Gods” gameplay is open for a limited time, but players may not accurately remember the opening time of the gameplay. A small red dot can remind players that the gameplay is open and it’s time to start a game. Without the prompt of a small red dot, players may gradually forget that this gameplay will be opened at a specific time. In this function, such a design not only guides players’ behavior, but also reduces players’ cognitive load. They no longer need to remember the opening time of the gameplay themselves. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make players more confident about the difficulty of the level - inform players of their abilities through UI differences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the “Realm of Gods” gameplay of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the UI difference of the recommended Divine Sense level above the level confirmation button visually informs players whether they have matched the behavioral ability required by the level. The gold color of recommended Divine Sense Level, indicates that the player has reached the recommended Divine Sense level, informing players that has the ability to perform this action, thus directly satisfying the “ability” factor that triggers the action. When the required behavioral ability is not reached, a red prompt is used to prevent players from misjudging their abilities and challenging the level, but instead gaining frustration from it. </p>

Conclusion</h2><p>By deconstructing the Fogg Model theory behind the most basic interaction design, we can understand the three elements that affect user behavior: motivation, ability, and prompt (triggering element), helping us to design players’ trajectories in the game more purposefully during the design process, and to verify whether a design can well guide players’ behavior in design self-checks, thereby improving players’ gaming experience and motivating them to continue to be active in the game.</p>

<p>In games, the top navigation is the skeleton of the game, supporting the overall content and information, helping the game to display the entrances of various functions intuitively and clearly to the player. The design of the top navigation is invariant amidst change. Its form serves its navigational functionality and follows similar interaction principles. This article will start from the functionality of the game top navigation, use multiple cases to illustrate the design commonalities of the game top navigation, and talk about its adaptation design on different platforms.</p>
<h2 id="1-Form-Serves-Function-Commonalities-of-Top-Navigation"><a href="#1-Form-Serves-Function-Commonalities-of-Top-Navigation" class="headerlink" title="1. Form Serves Function - Commonalities of Top Navigation"></a>1. Form Serves Function - Commonalities of Top Navigation</h2><p>The form of design serves the function. The function of top navigation boils down to displaying entrances of different levels and playing a certain guiding role. A good top navigation design should be able to clearly express the information of each entrance, and provide appropriate and eye-catching guidance for the information that needs attention.</p>
<h3 id="Design-Basis-Design-According-to-Browsing-Order"><a href="#Design-Basis-Design-According-to-Browsing-Order" class="headerlink" title="Design Basis: Design According to Browsing Order"></a>Design Basis: Design According to Browsing Order</h3><p>Users have an “F-shaped” browsing mode when browsing web pages or apps. The characteristic of this mode is to focus the user’s attention on the top and left side of the page. Specifically, the first line of text on the same page receives more attention than the following lines; the first few words on the left of each line are more acceptable than the words on the right.</p>
<p>In design, the functions of the top navigation bar will also be arranged according to weight, and more important functions will be placed in the left area. Because in the structure of the “F-shaped mode”, the content on the far left in the top navigation has more visual weight, it is located in a more main visual area and has a higher priority. For example, in the mail system of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> below, the main title is placed on the far left, and the other entrances are arranged according to the frequency of use and general browsing habits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F544b7671-2353-4634-8c2e-746cb5451d11.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Design-Hierarchy-Clearly-Defined-Information-Presentation"><a href="#Design-Hierarchy-Clearly-Defined-Information-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Design Hierarchy: Clearly Defined Information Presentation"></a>Design Hierarchy: Clearly Defined Information Presentation</h3><p>The top navigation belongs to the global control layer of the interface, and undertakes the control and navigation functions of the entire product, determining the interaction logic and sequence of the product. The top navigation supports the overall structure as the skeleton of the product, which can effectively reduce the understanding cost of the interface.</p>
<p>Therefore, the level of the top navigation itself also needs to be more distinct, and it needs to be able to simplify the information of the main interface and help players quickly reach the target interface. If the top navigation occupies an important position and presents too much information, it will increase the burden of use. In the design process, it is necessary to sort out the functions by level, and incorporate the important entrances and information of high frequency into the top navigation.</p>
<p>Taking the design of the lobby entrance of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as an example, important content related to the in-game experience (heroes, talents, weapons), and the main promotion information related to the season are placed on the left side of the top navigation, and the less important information and functions are placed on the right side, achieving a relatively distinct level display. </p>

<li><p><strong>State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unselected state:</strong> Concise and clear, progressive</p>
<p>  Text is often used to describe the function of the entrance. If the interface information density is too high, icons can also be used to reduce the cognitive load caused by text. In addition, when there is secondary navigation, it is necessary to design in terms of level layout, color, text, etc., to distinguish the primary and secondary relationship of different levels of navigation.</p>

<pre><code>- **Selected state:** Distinctly different, prominent state

   The entrance in the selected state will be distinguished by adding a colored background block. Some text information is hidden in the secondary tab, and the selected state will also display the corresponding text description.

<pre><code>- **Hover state:** Supplementary explanation, click prompt

    In some interfaces with too much information, you can consider using the Hover state to trigger explanatory Tips to explain the detailed role of the entrance, so that players who want to further understand a certain function or state can achieve cognitive purposes with additional text information.

<pre><code>- **Unopened state:** Clear expression, weakened design

    Some entrances need to meet certain conditions before they can be opened, so it is necessary to design an unopened state, which is often expressed by icons and different colors.

<p>  In games, a “red dot” will be designed at the function entrance to prompt players to check for new changes. The red dot can also change with the state when selected. In <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em>, the selected red dot will expand into a text description.</p>

- **Special styles:** Based on function, changing performance

    In the navigation, you can also try to design special reminders based on the nature of different functions. For example, in *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, commercial functions such as season passes and stores have designed different styles of red dots.

Adapting for the Platform - Individuality of Top Navigation"></a>2. Adapting for the Platform - Individuality of Top Navigation</h2><p>Consoles, computers, and mobile phones are the three main carriers of games. Due to the differences in their interaction methods, users have different experience habits, which also brings different design focuses.</p>
<p>The operation and display areas of consoles and PCs are separated, so the button prompts and icons on the interface can be made very small, and the arrangement position is also less restricted, and there is no need to worry about blocking or accidental touches during operation. The problems that need to be considered in device adaptation for these two types of carriers are simpler, and there are more free design choices.</p>
<h3 id="PC-Design-that-Breaks-Through-Limitations"><a href="#PC-Design-that-Breaks-Through-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="PC: Design that Breaks Through Limitations"></a>PC: Design that Breaks Through Limitations</h3><p>The biggest advantage of PC games is the mouse. Because the mouse has a hover state, it can directly break through the level, making the display area the interactive space. The interface can bear a huge amount of information and interaction without causing large-scale occlusion. At the same time, the operation accuracy is very high, and the volume of interactive components can be compressed as much as possible, which virtually increases the information capacity of the display area. Compared with the icon-based mobile game function entrance design, the top navigation can use the “text + color block background” entrance presentation method without considering the volume problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2Fcbe6fec6-fb0a-47a1-b304-0c94c6d2d115.png/size/"></p>
<p>In some cases, the mouse may be occupied by other functions and the cursor is not displayed. At this time, the PC can also configure key bindings for the top navigation and display them on the UI. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F291552e9-110a-493b-a2e6-609f3faac33f.png/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Console-Design-Within-Level-Constraints"><a href="#Console-Design-Within-Level-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Console: Design Within Level Constraints"></a>Console: Design Within Level Constraints</h3><p>Console games are generally interacted with through a controller. Because this type does not use a convenient cursor, the interface pays special attention to levels, and multiple interactions are required to achieve the goal. Many operations (including click&#x2F;slide) of controller games will have corresponding button prompts to deal with various risks during the operation.</p>
<p>Similar to PC, placing the navigation at the top is more in line with the player’s browsing movement and controller key layout, and it is also used more frequently in console games. The top navigation keys are generally configured on the shoulder buttons (L1, R1 or LB, RB), and the corresponding button UI can be drawn in the game to remind players of the operation method. </p>

<p>Some games with double-layer tabs will configure the first-level tabs on the shoulder buttons, which have a relatively short key travel and clear pressing feedback. The secondary tab is configured on the right joystick to facilitate switching with the tab content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F4463cdec-e25b-4b4d-ade2-e236cf9bb197.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>《The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild》</em></p>

<p>In addition, the design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is supplemented by the operation mode of “left joystick + A button”, and a mouse-like operation method is designed. The joystick becomes a mouse, providing players with more convenient choices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F97f45ee2-a713-404a-abd4-712d2a046493.png/size/"></p>

<p>Consoles benefit from their natural carrier advantages, and players have a greater sense of ceremony when playing. The creation of immersion in games on this platform is particularly important, and it is necessary to pay attention to visual, auditory and other aspects of the experience, and the design of sound effects is also more detailed. For example, in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, when switching left and right with the controller, the left and right channels will be distinguished. This subtle design can also highlight the quality and delicacy of the game. </p>

Due to interaction method restrictions, areas where top navigation would generally be placed are outside of operational range, most games would opt for bottom navigation. The top is used to present high-frequency information, for ease of player perusal.</p>
<p>Taking <em>Ace Racer</em> as an example, the lobby interface adopts a bottom-level navigation design, placing high-frequency entrances and the start game button at the bottom right, and displaying information such as currency that needs to be viewed frequently but does not require operation at the top. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F56f30cfe-36cb-4c81-b584-af62472aec7c.jpg/size/"></p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Game top navigation is a very common functional design, serving its function of filtering and classifying information and displaying entrances. A good top navigation design can greatly reduce the player’s information load and optimize the game operation and cognitive experience. In the development process, designers should design different operation methods according to the characteristics of different terminals, and adjust the design details to achieve the best interactive effect.</p>

<p>The Southeast Asian game market has always been a must-go place for many manufacturers when expanding overseas, with huge potential. It has also been called the fastest-growing region for the global game market by Newzoo. According to Statista, the total size of the game market in the region was US$5.24 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow to US$6.28 billion by 2024 and US$7.47 billion by 2027.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia has 11 countries, a total population of 650 million, and 380 million Internet users, with an Internet penetration rate of 58%, and this proportion will continue to increase; mobile devices are becoming cheaper and more powerful for Southeast Asian consumers, which also contributes to the fact that more than two-thirds (67%) of the game industry’s revenue in the region comes from mobile devices, while the proportion of PCs is only 24%, and consoles only account for 9%.</p>
<p>Clearly, Southeast Asia is a mobile-first market. As the country with the second-largest GDP in Southeast Asia, Thailand’s 32 million gamers have helped the Thai game market generate more than 6.8 billion RMB in revenue, making it one of the most notable game markets in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As one of the most important countries for domestic games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia, the Thai mobile market has unlimited possibilities. And a full understanding of local users will be a very important factor affecting the success of overseas expansion in this country. Recently, for a game under development, we went to Bangkok, the largest city in Thailand, and two border cities in Thailand, Ubon Ratchathani and Chiang Mai, to conduct in-depth research.</p>
<h2 id="1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand"><a href="#1-Popular-Game-Genres-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand"></a>1. Popular Game Genres in Thailand</h2><p>Before setting off, we collected some data to understand the currently popular games in Thailand. Combined with past research experience, we initially came to the following hypothesis: Thai players like to play games developed by their own country, and in terms of game types, they prefer multiplayer competitive games, especially MOBA, battle royale, MMORPG, and casual games, which have the best revenue in Thailand.</p>
<p>Take the top ten of the iOS best-selling list on April 2, 2023 (from Qimai Data) as an example, including 4 casual games, 1 MOBA game, 2 sports games, 1 MMORPG, and 1 shooting game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F50ec6006-97ab-4000-99c6-56c9be46e107.png/size/"></p>
<p><em>Free Fire</em>, published by Garena, one of the largest publishers in Thailand, is very popular; in addition, football mobile games are also very popular in Thailand. <em>eFootball 2023</em> has long occupied the top three of the best-selling list in Thailand, and often competes for the first place.</p>
<h2 id="2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research"><a href="#2-First-hand-Information-on-Thai-Research" class="headerlink" title="2. First-hand Information on Thai Research"></a>2. First-hand Information on Thai Research</h2><h3 id="Thai-Prices"><a href="#Thai-Prices" class="headerlink" title="Thai Prices"></a>Thai Prices</h3><p>According to data from Thai statistical agencies, as the largest city in Thailand, the average monthly salary in Bangkok in 2022 was 22,274 baht (approximately 4,219 RMB). The cost of living in Bangkok is similar to that of second-tier cities in China. A meal can be solved at a street stall for 100 baht, and a meal in a food court in a large shopping mall can be settled for about 200 baht. In addition, the 7-Elevens that can be seen everywhere in Bangkok are also similar in price to domestic convenience stores.</p>
<p>Combined with the average monthly income of Bangkok, residents have a certain amount of entertainment consumption in their disposable income. Mobile games are a very popular form of entertainment for young people in Thailand, and making some recharges in mobile games is also very acceptable to many young people, which is one of the fundamental reasons why the Thai mobile game market is so hot. </p>

<h3 id="Thai-People’s-Travel"><a href="#Thai-People’s-Travel" class="headerlink" title="Thai People’s Travel"></a>Thai People’s Travel</h3><p>Thailand is located in the south-central part of Asia, and it is hot most of the year. It happened to be midsummer when we went, so in many cases, there were fewer people walking on the street, and everyone chose to travel by motorcycle, car, etc. Thai universities generally have a large area, and many students also choose to use motorcycles to travel in school. Based on the characteristics of this national condition, in order to reach more young people and conduct street interviews in Thai universities, we chose more indoor places with a lot of traffic. When there are not many pedestrians on the road, it is difficult to invite students to do user testing and random interviews.</p>
<h3 id="Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand"><a href="#Entertainment-Methods-of-Young-People-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand"></a>Entertainment Methods of Young People in Thailand</h3><p>Different from China, there are few Internet cafes in Thailand and their business hours are short. An Internet cafe we found after walking for more than 20 minutes in Bangkok was only open from 2 pm to 10 pm. Through research, we found that many young people in Thailand said that they basically don’t go to Internet cafes. One of the reasons is that during the epidemic, Internet cafes were strictly controlled. Some people had their own PC devices or started playing mobile games. Combined with the factors such as the high cost performance and rapid technological upgrading of mobile devices, the share of mobile games in Thailand will be much higher than that of PC games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F24f11f92-c390-4933-9313-74f87c7926fd.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>Here, in addition to games, the most popular form of entertainment for young people is to gather with friends in board game cafes to play board games, or chat and play games in cafes. Most of these places also provide WIFI. Playing against&#x2F;with friends has also become an important form of entertainment for them. No matter what they do, for many Thai players, having friends together is their most important entertainment condition. This is also one of the reasons why Thai players value social interaction so much in games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F7a8831bd-8ed9-4ff4-871a-eba5bb24329d.jpg/size/"></p>
<h3 id="Sports-that-Thai-People-Like"><a href="#Sports-that-Thai-People-Like" class="headerlink" title="Sports that Thai People Like"></a>Sports that Thai People Like</h3><p>Thailand can be said to be a country of football. Football-related advertisements can be seen everywhere, and public football fields here are almost all open for free. Because there are many people playing, it is also common to see queues. At present, almost every province, county, and village in Thailand has its own non-professional team, and many schools also have their own school teams. Thai people like to play football and integrate football into their lives, which can also be seen in their TV dramas, movies, and public service advertisements.</p>
<p>The situation we observed in the sports field of the university was that there were only a few people playing basketball at about 4 pm, while there were already more than 10 people playing football. The love of Thai people for football is also reflected in the game market. The reason why the aforementioned <em>eFootball2023</em> can occupy the top three of the mobile game best-selling list for a long time, and even occasionally compete for the first place, is inseparable from the fact that everyone loves this sport and the player base is large. </p>

<h3 id="Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content"><a href="#Thai-People-Like-Personalized-Content" class="headerlink" title="Thai People Like Personalized Content"></a>Thai People Like Personalized Content</h3><p>From the perspective of game character selection, some players are not very impressed with some stars and big IPs in the game. On the contrary, they want to get a personalized experience in the game, such as playing a role like themselves in a game. When choosing a map they don’t like, they will also judge it based on reasons such as it being too popular, too common, and wanting a unique scene. On the streets of Bangkok, large-scale graffiti that can be seen everywhere is also a manifestation of personalization. </p>

<h3 id="Mobile-Device-Selection"><a href="#Mobile-Device-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Device Selection"></a>Mobile Device Selection</h3><p>Among the research group, we found that most users mainly use Android phones, and the price is generally between 1,000 and 3,000 RMB. The price also limits the performance parameters of users’ mobile phones, and the limitation of mobile phone performance will lead to some rigid requirements for players’ choice of games. In addition, similar to other Southeast Asian countries, there are many Android mobile phone manufacturers in the Thai market, with a wide variety of models, and there are also a large number of old machines from many years ago, which also puts certain adaptation and optimization pressure on games that want to expand overseas to Thailand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F00e7e298-f19c-45d9-8fdc-448573b21c60.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games"><a href="#3-Reasons-Why-Thai-Players-Choose-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games"></a>3. Reasons Why Thai Players Choose Games</h2><p>In this research, based on the purpose of the research and previous assumptions, we mainly conducted street interviews on pedestrians on the streets of three cities in Thailand to understand their age, occupation, personal hobbies, game experience, etc. Based on some research results, here is a summary of the factors that Thai players value when choosing games:</p>
<h3 id="Short-Duration"><a href="#Short-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Short Duration"></a>Short Duration</h3><p>Similar to white-collar workers in many countries, the working hours of white-collar workers in Bangkok, Thailand are generally 8-9 am to 5-6 pm, with an hour for lunch, including meals. White-collar workers do not have much time to spend on games during the day on weekdays, and many players tend to choose games with short single play times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2F09318b2f-361e-4a35-a216-bd950b3f060d.jpg/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Some CBDs have a street of small stalls, and many white-collar workers choose to have lunch here</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles"><a href="#Preference-for-Japanese-and-Korean-Art-Styles" class="headerlink" title="Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles"></a>Preference for Japanese and Korean Art Styles</h3><p>The art style is what many Thai players pay attention to first when they see advertisements. Whether they like the art style is an important factor in whether they will download the game. Thai players are more influenced by Japanese and Korean comics in terms of art, and they will prefer games with Japanese and Korean comic art style themes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230816%2Fc5582ae2-38b3-4e4b-97bd-689e41169935.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bookstores in Thailand display many Japanese comics</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Social-Interaction"><a href="#Social-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Social Interaction"></a>Social Interaction</h3><p>Social interaction is one of the reasons why Thai players pay great attention to when choosing games. Whether they can play with friends, and whether there is enough interaction when playing with friends, are important indicators that affect their choice of a game. Some players believe that even if a game is fun, they will not be able to continue to experience it in depth without friends; and even if a game is not very fond of the subject matter, playing with friends and being able to get a good enough interactive experience can also drive players to follow in the footsteps of their friends and play together. Not only games, but many activities in users’ lives are also for social purposes, such as playing basketball or other sports, which is just a form of gathering with friends.</p>
<h2 id="4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions"><a href="#4-Overseas-Research-Methods-and-Precautions" class="headerlink" title="4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions"></a>4. Overseas Research Methods and Precautions</h2><p>If you also want to do research in Thailand, how should you choose the research method, player recruitment, and research location?</p>
<p>First of all, it is recommended to find places in the target city where the target population may be more concentrated, and conduct preliminary site visits. Take Bangkok as an example, BTS stations, shopping malls, and university campuses are all places with a lot of traffic. However, not all locations are suitable for research. For example, people at BTS stations are in a hurry, and basically no one has time to accept interviews or research, let alone stop to test your game, even for a few minutes. Cafes and board game cafes near shopping malls or universities usually have a lot of free young people, and these places can be considered as priority locations for interviews. However, it should be noted that Thailand has begun to use PDPA laws. If you want to conduct interviews in places with a lot of traffic, you need to submit a written application to the local agency. At the same time, we recommend avoiding conducting research in some popular tourist attractions or airports, where most of the people encountered will be tourists, and it is conceivable that some errors may occur in the research results.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, if there are no professional language personnel, you can choose a local supplier to provide freelancers for Thai language research; if the target group to be researched is relatively fixed, you can also recruit some players who are interested in participating in the research in advance before traveling. For example, if the target group is relatively young, you can contact some suppliers in advance to find players in the university who are interested in games or have similar game experience, and make appointments for all the time before departure, which can greatly improve the efficiency of interviews and research. Pay attention to arranging time for the executing freelancers to train in the interview outline and process to avoid problems such as inadequate implementation and insufficient results in the later stage; if it involves the execution of multiple player studies, after each test, you can promptly review the research situation of the day with the executing personnel, so as to make adjustments to the research plan in time, improve the execution details, and at the same time produce an agile summary, which will be able to complete the research of the day relatively comprehensively.</p>
<p>The important thing about overseas field research is to understand the local situation in advance; before traveling, determine the target population and master the living habits related to the target population and research purpose, such as entertainment methods, travel and consumption preferences, etc. This can improve efficiency in research, save execution time, and ensure the final research results.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, Thailand’s Internet penetration rate is steadily increasing, the population structure is young, and the mobile game market still has great potential for development. It is a must-see place for games to expand overseas in Southeast Asia. This field research on Thai users can help us better understand the different regional markets in Thailand and all aspects of Thai game players, so that our games expanding overseas can better adapt to the local environment, reduce distribution risks, and provide a better game experience for a wider range of overseas players.</p>

    <title>The Third Aspect of Game Localization - How Important is Compliance Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/08/16/netease-ux-articles/news_20230821_28584_1105623/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230821/28584_1105623.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, going global has become an unavoidable battle of strength and resources for Chinese game manufacturers.</p>
<p>The core of a game going global is “localization.” In addition to product, language, style, and cultural localization, understanding and adapting to the laws, regulations, and policies of the local overseas market is also a crucial part of localization.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four main legal compliance issues that deserve attention. First, the market access issue of “games going global”; second, overseas game rating systems; third, the cross-border data flow issue of “games going global”; and fourth, the consumer protection of “games going global.” We will elaborate on these with cases from different countries or regions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#1-Market-Access-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>1. Market Access Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Taiwan-China"><a href="#Taiwan-China" class="headerlink" title="Taiwan, China"></a>Taiwan, China</h3><p>Currently, the game market in Taiwan, China is not directly open to mainland companies. The reason is that Taiwan’s “Cross-Strait People’s Relations Regulations” has the following local regulations: “Profit-making enterprises in the mainland area shall not engage in business activities in Taiwan unless they have been approved by the competent authority and have established a branch or office in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>If mainland game manufacturers publish games in Taiwan, they generally choose one of the following two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cooperate with a local agent in Taiwan. For example, a mainland company acts as the game developer, and a Taiwan company acts as the game publisher and operator. According to Taiwan regulations, if the developer, producer, and publisher of the game are mainland-funded, the Taiwan agent should enter the game information and submit proof of agency before the game goes live.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish an overseas company and launch the game in Taiwan through the Apple App Store and Google Play. However, in terms of specific game product promotion and marketing, mainland companies still need to cooperate with Taiwan companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Vietnam"><a href="#Vietnam" class="headerlink" title="Vietnam"></a>Vietnam</h3><p>Games are subject to government approval and licensing. Two licenses are required during the game’s operation: the first is the company’s operating qualification, and the second is the product’s launch license. Vietnam’s game publishing license regulations are relatively strict, and it takes about 6-9 months to apply for this license. However, given the qualifications and government review, not every publisher has sufficient conditions and capabilities to apply for a game license. At the same time, the Vietnamese government’s supervision of mobile games is also stricter than that of China. Therefore, Chinese developers who want to enter Vietnam must thoroughly study the relevant laws of Vietnam to avoid being unable to meet players in the region after making many preparations.</p>
<h2 id="2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems"><a href="#2-Overseas-Game-Rating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Overseas Game Rating Systems"></a>2. Overseas Game Rating Systems</h2><h3 id="South-Korea"><a href="#South-Korea" class="headerlink" title="South Korea"></a>South Korea</h3><p>South Korea strictly implements a game rating system. The GRB rating standards have five levels: All Ages, 18+, 15+, 12+, and Test Level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fb445e865-dc61-4557-ad1c-b50f3a87134e.png/size/"></p>
<p>Among them, what needs special explanation and description is the “Test Level,” which means that game manufacturers can conduct preliminary public tests on the product’s stability and other aspects within 30 days before the official launch of the game product, and the exclusive “Test Level” logo should be placed at this time.</p>
<p>In addition, all games must not only place rating logos, but also display content logos (such as violence logos, tobacco, alcohol, and drug logos, sex logos, etc.) for content in the game that may have negative effects.</p>
<h3 id="Japan"><a href="#Japan" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>A game rating system already exists in the Japanese market. According to relevant Japanese regulations, game software is divided into five levels according to content, and provided to consumers of different ages according to specific ratings. The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) classifies the levels based on whether the game content involves sexual performance, violent performance, anti-social behavior, language or thought, and the specific degree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F28890d5b-2817-49a2-a0e5-b6e507f176e4.png/size/"></p>
<p>With the rise of mobile games, more games are provided to players through app stores. The Apple App Store and Google Play have their own rating standards for the games provided on their platforms. For example, the Apple App Store divides the games that can be listed into four main categories, and requires developers to fill in their own declarations according to the Apple rating standards when reviewing games.</p>
<h3 id="United-States"><a href="#United-States" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>The United States is a pioneer in game rating systems. As early as the early 1990s, the undisguised violence in <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> caused a great backlash from public opinion, prompting the American game industry to unite and try to formulate a game rating system.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States generally implements the ESRB rating system, which is divided into six levels: E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), AO (Adults Only 18+), and RP (Rating Pending). </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F6c1ca039-ec29-48a0-957f-5ca9ed70bf9e.png/size/"></p>
<p>The above ratings apply not only to the game content itself, but also to game promotional advertisements. Although the ESRB rating system follows the principle of voluntariness, almost all games in Canada and the United States are rated, otherwise they may not be distributed to the public.</p>
<p>Many players also use the information of the ESRB rating to secretly infer whether a certain game is about to be launched, or the general content direction of the game.</p>
<h2 id="3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#3-Cross-border-Data-Flow-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>3. Cross-border Data Flow Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="United-States-1"><a href="#United-States-1" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>CCPA is the abbreviation of The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. It is another information data protection bill introduced by California, USA on June 28, 2018, and officially implemented on January 1, 2020. It is known as the “strictest and most comprehensive personal privacy protection bill” in the United States. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fe70ff009-f81e-4f37-88cd-1cae2de5bd78.png/size/"></p>
<p>The jurisdiction principle of CCPA is the principle of personality, that is, it only protects California residents. If every aspect of the game manufacturer’s information collection of players (including the player’s affiliation) is not in California, it is not subject to CCPA. However, since California has a population of more than 40 million, game manufacturers theoretically cannot distinguish whether players are California residents through IP addresses, and California is the most economically developed state in the United States, with the most prosperous Internet and technological innovation. Game manufacturers going global in the United States will inevitably be regulated by CCPA.</p>
<p>The main content of CCPA is actually to give players more control over the collection and management of their personal information by game manufacturers, including but not limited to: the right to know, the right to delete, the right to refuse, the right to opt-in, and the right to opt-out.</p>
<p>If the game manufacturer fails to follow the rules of CCPA, violates its obligations and fails to implement and maintain security procedures and take measures consistent with the nature of the information to protect the player’s personal information, thus suffering unauthorized access and leakage, theft or disclosure, the player can file a civil lawsuit. Game manufacturers may be required to pay each player $100-750 in damages or actual damages (whichever is greater), or face injunctions, etc.</p>
<h3 id="EU"><a href="#EU" class="headerlink" title="EU"></a>EU</h3><p>On May 25, 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), known as the strictest data protection regulation in history, was officially implemented. It puts forward high requirements for enterprises to collect, store, protect, transfer, and use users’ personal information data within the EU. With its wide scope of application and severe penalties, it has aroused widespread concern among Chinese game companies going global. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F06a69c1f-ef55-439b-ad37-315625a62b42.png/size/"></p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the GDPR, game companies will be subject to the GDPR in the following situations: First, the game company has an establishment in the EU, regardless of whether its data processing behavior occurs in the EU; second, even if the game company’s place of business is not located in the EU, as long as it provides services to players in the EU (whether or not it charges players), or monitors the behavior of players in the EU.</p>
<p>For game companies going global that are subject to the GDPR, the consequences of violating the bill are very serious. According to Article 83 of the GDPR, the regulatory authority has the right to impose two levels of administrative penalties on enterprises for different illegal acts. The first level can be up to an administrative fine of 10 million euros, or an administrative fine of 2% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher); the second level can be up to an administrative fine of 20 million euros, or an administrative fine of 4% of the enterprise’s total global turnover in the previous fiscal year (whichever is higher). When game companies go global in the EU, they should treat the GDPR bill with caution, and explain the scope of information collection, how it is stored, and how the information will be used in a simple and easy-to-understand form and language before collecting player personal information.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Meta was fined $1.2 billion for violating relevant provisions of the GDPR by transferring user data across borders to the United States, which is also the heaviest fine issued by EU regulators since the bill came into effect.</p>
<h2 id="4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”"><a href="#4-Consumer-Protection-Issues-of-“Games-Going-Global”" class="headerlink" title="4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”"></a>4. Consumer Protection Issues of “Games Going Global”</h2><h3 id="Japan-1"><a href="#Japan-1" class="headerlink" title="Japan"></a>Japan</h3><p>According to the “Online Game Operation Specifications” formulated by the Japan Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA), games are required to clearly indicate the estimated amount of rare items obtained in the Gacha gameplay (similar to loot boxes) in the Gacha mechanism. The upper and lower limits of the Gacha drop rate must be provided in the Gacha machine; the respective drop rates are provided according to the types of Gacha items, etc.</p>
<p>Such regulations are similar to our domestic regulations on the publicity of draw probabilities - the main purpose is to prevent games from prompting users to overpay with unclear drop probabilities. The difference between the two is that the regulations on probability publicity in China are government regulations, while Japan is a self-regulatory norm of the association. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F3b736d7e-0bd8-4ef0-a6f3-211b5b895651.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>At the same time, in Article 3.1 of Apple’s “App Store Review Guidelines”, it has been clearly stated that apps that provide “loot boxes” or other mechanisms to purchase random virtual items must disclose the odds of obtaining each type of item to customers before they purchase. Therefore, manufacturers that provide games through the Apple App Store also need to comply with the regulation of random draw probability publicity.</p>
<h3 id="United-States-2"><a href="#United-States-2" class="headerlink" title="United States"></a>United States</h3><p>Loot boxes are an effective profit model explored by game manufacturers. Previously, the United States had not passed clear laws and regulations on loot box gameplay to ensure that the rights and interests of players were protected. Even if Hawaii had tried to make efforts, it had not passed any effective bills. Therefore, loot box gameplay is prevalent in the American game market.</p>
<p>But now this one of the world’s largest game markets has begun to legislate. In 2019, Republican lawmakers in the United States formally submitted a bill to Congress to prohibit game manufacturers from opening loot box gameplay to minors. This bill means that in all states of the United States, game companies will no longer be allowed to open loot box gameplay to minors under the age of 18, otherwise they may face corresponding fines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2F263945d9-ccca-4c58-8219-ed32593e45a7.png/size/"></p>
<p>Under the influence of this bill, Google added a new policy to Google Play, requiring games to clearly inform players of the drop rate of these items before they pay. At the same time, Google has added more restrictions to gambling games. “Cash and other items of value” that could originally be used as rewards are now strictly limited to “cash and other items of real value.”</p>
<h3 id="Europe"><a href="#Europe" class="headerlink" title="Europe"></a>Europe</h3><p>European countries have also taken measures against the game loot box mechanism.</p>
<p>The Belgian Gaming Commission (BGC) issued a report on game loot boxes, defining this payment system as gambling, and stating that game companies that violate local laws will face fines to imprisonment. This directly led to the region lock of <em>FIFA</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> loot boxes, and Nintendo removed <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> from the Belgian region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230821%2Fc734fc1d-173d-4e17-a177-efb19a42d856.png/size/"></p>
<p>In the Netherlands, six members of parliament jointly submitted a bill to the House of Representatives to restrict game loot boxes, aiming to prohibit elements such as “loot boxes” and “gacha” from appearing in Dutch games. Members of parliament believe that this gameplay is essentially a kind of gambling, but it is covered with a layer of “micro-transactions” by manufacturers, and there is a possibility of attracting immature children to recharge to obtain benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, Spain has also submitted a new bill to restrict game loot boxes, which also strictly controls “loot boxes” and “gacha” elements, and is even more detailed than the Netherlands. It is reported that Spain’s new bill requires players to provide official age certificates, implement mandatory recharge limits, and require developers to disclose detailed odds of loot drops&#x2F;draws, and impose stricter restrictions on “loot boxes” and “gacha”. Those who do not comply with the new regulations will be fined between 25 and 100 euros.</p>
<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, game companies going global is both an opportunity and a challenge. If you want to be invincible and forge ahead in the journey of going global, while building your own excellent game product strength, you need to pay attention to the various laws and regulations of the target market, as well as religious, cultural, customs and habits. In addition to completing text and cultural localization, it is necessary to do a good job of product compliance localization, pay attention to market access thresholds, game rating systems, cross-border data flow, and consumer protection issues.</p>

    <title>How Should Game Localization Deal with Slang</title>
    <url>/2023/08/21/netease-ux-articles/news_20230828_28584_1106879/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20230828/28584_1106879.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2 id="1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games"><a href="#1-The-Origin-of-“Slang”-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games"></a>1. The Origin of “Slang” in Games</h2><p>“Are you a GG or an MM?” “YYDS” “666” “GG”.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t play games, you can more or less hear these words or phrases in many situations in life. This kind of expression is the so-called “game slang”, most of which originated from the mouths of game players, and basically has some humorous color. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F234e7be8-7321-475f-8637-f40ad7e83037.png/size/"></p>
<p>The so-called “slang” originally referred to some cryptic words created by various groups or communities in the civil society during the feudal society due to their cultural customs and communication needs. It was mainly used by people in the underworld to communicate privately and hide secrets. In modern times, after the development of the Internet, some special terms used on the Internet or in games are also called “Internet slang” or “game slang”.</p>
<p>The Internet and the game world are full of all kinds of players. As the saying goes, “Where there are people, there is a <em>jianghu</em> (江湖 - jiāng hú, literally “rivers and lakes”, referring to the martial arts world or the underworld)”. Therefore, players who walk in the game <em>jianghu</em> have gradually created sets of unique “game slang” that only people in their own circle can understand.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but many overseas games also have exclusive “slang” and are widely known. For example, “氪金 (kè jīn)” refers to the act of recharging in the game. This word is considered to be a transliteration and misreading of the Japanese word 課金 (かきん - kakīn). In Japanese, 課金 (kakīn) refers to the profit model of using cash to purchase game resources in the game. The transformation from “課金” to “氪金” is not simply because the two are pronounced similarly, but because in the “Burning Crusade” expansion of the game <em>World of Warcraft</em>, a rare ore translated as “Khorium” in the Chinese server was added. Due to its extremely valuable nature, this ore has always had a very high price. Therefore, after the rise of mobile games, some players linked “氪金” and “課金” together, not only because of the pronunciation, but also because of the value of the two. </p>

<h3 id="Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear"><a href="#Why-Does-“Slang”-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Why Does “Slang” Appear?"></a>Why Does “Slang” Appear?</h3><p>The reasons for the emergence of slang are diverse. One reason can be attributed to the fact that the names of equipment and skills in the game are too long, and they are not smooth to say in actual combat. For example, in the game <em>EVE Online</em>, game terms such as Warp Scrambler and Stasis Webifier are too tongue-twisting. When playing the game, saying the full name will affect the command, etc. Therefore, for convenience, these equipment will be referred to according to the equipment effect or the abbreviation of the equipment name. For example, the slang of the Warp Scrambler mentioned above is “long point” (长反 - cháng fǎn) because it has a longer range, but the warp disruption strength caused is lower, and it cannot close the microwarpdrive. In addition to weapons, equipment, and skills, players will also “attack” the names of heroes. Many games have also given many “slang names” to some heroes due to players’ consensus on the appearance, skills, and background of these heroes.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see from the above that the “slang” that appears in the game is generally for the convenience of players to communicate when playing. In a fast-paced online game, players generally do not have much time to type, and the game itself only provides some very simple signals to help players communicate quickly. Therefore, players will invent “slang”, which is generally short and vivid.</p>
<p>Of course, the emergence and spread of game slang cannot be separated from the “humorous and comedic” effect. When a particular expression can achieve a strong comedic effect in a certain situation, players will start to use it frequently in other similar scenes. Coupled with the entertainment attributes of the game itself, this slang will naturally begin to spread widely.</p>
<h2 id="2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games"><a href="#2-“Slang”-Appearing-in-Overseas-and-Domestic-Multiplayer-Online-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games"></a>2. “Slang” Appearing in Overseas and Domestic Multiplayer Online Games</h2><p>Most overseas and domestic games have unique “slang” tables, including everything from in-game character names to game items, to various sentences and words used by players when communicating in the game community, as well as their abbreviations and nicknames. We will take the Chinese, Japanese, and English versions of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> as the main examples to summarize the frequently appearing game “slang” and their meanings.</p>
<p>As a multiplayer online game with a multiplayer team mode, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> has also spawned a lot of “slang” in social aspects. In addition to text, this “slang” also exists in the form of emoji and kaomoji, which plays a great role in player communication in the game community.</p>
<p>In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>’s Chinese server duos or trios teams, you often hear words like “帮我拆火 (bāng wǒ chāi huǒ - help me break the fire)”, “咱们去空投 (zán men qù kōng tóu - let’s go to the airdrop)”, “猛蓄猛出 (měng xù měng chū - fierce charge and release)”, “压力怪 (yā lì guài - pressure monster)”, “拉我 (lā wǒ - pull me)” and so on. These slang words may sound confusing to players who don’t play this game, but they are familiar to veteran players. The word “拆火” means to help teammates fight against the enemy and interfere when teammates are attacked by the enemy, so as to achieve the purpose of dispersing firepower. “空投” in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> refers to the supplies dropped in the safe zone, “Airdrop”. The meaning of “猛蓄猛出” is easy to understand, referring to players who only charge and release directly. “压力怪” does not mean that they feel a lot of pressure, but usually refers to people who “put pressure” on their teammates in the game to achieve their own emotional venting. There are many ways to exert pressure, such as verbal pressure (ridicule, abuse) and behavioral pressure (malicious interference), etc. Chinese server players even change the part of speech of the name “压力” into a verb, creating new “slang” in the form of “pressure teammates”. </p>

<p><em>Some of the Slang in Naraka: Bladepoint</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When studying the “slang” of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s English and Japanese regions, we found that the “slang” used by overseas players when chatting in the game community is mostly abbreviations of daily expressions and game terms, followed by emoji. We have summarized some of them in the table below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2Fd3a1b446-c56a-45c1-8beb-2c82a1789e6d.png/size/"></p>

Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process"></a>3. Challenges of “Slang” Translation in the Localization Process</h2><p>It can be seen from the table above that the “slang” in English and Japanese includes abbreviations, generalizations and codes of game terms and daily expressions. There are also direct use of pictures, such as emoji, or kaomoji to express one’s feelings more vividly.</p>
<p>Some of these “slang” are even very similar to those we use in China. For example, English players will use “rmb” to refer to the “right mouse button” in the game, and Japanese players will use “草 (kusa - grass)” to express “laugh” or “www” (the Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter sounds). However, it should be noted that although the two are very similar and even written the same way, their meanings are completely different in different language environments. In addition, “slang” is often concise, obscure, and targeted. Not to mention foreign players, some new players in the server do not understand it at all. Therefore, in the process of game localization translation, how to translate these “slang” so that players of the corresponding language can also quickly understand the meaning it conveys and facilitate smoother communication between players has become a major challenge in the localization process.</p>
<h3 id="Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries"><a href="#Breaking-Through-the-Cultural-Barriers-of-Corresponding-Language-Countries" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries"></a>Breaking Through the Cultural Barriers of Corresponding Language Countries</h3><p>Different regions have different cultures. The differences between one culture and other cultures constitute cultural barriers, which are mainly reflected in the differences in language, way of thinking, customs, religious beliefs, moral standards, political and legal systems, and outlook on life, world outlook, and values. In the localization process of a game dominated by multiplayer gameplay, the localization team needs to consider the convenience of communication between players, and focus on translating by studying the cultural characteristics of the target area and the style of “slang” in other games in the area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230828%2F1676f96a-6fdf-461b-9a97-fcc9f80c12f6.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Unlike in other countries, GG in China has a negative connotation.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In English-speaking regions, players are more inclined to abbreviate in-game props and terms, or abbreviate two words after splicing them together to achieve the purpose of fast typing and communication; Japanese players tend to create “slang” based on the characteristics of game terms (appearance, etc.) combined with local culture. As mentioned above, “Fiddlesticks” is called “かかし (kakashi)” because “かかし (kakashi)” originally means scarecrow in Japanese, and the surname of “Kakashi Hatake” in <em>Naruto</em> is “Hatake”, which can be translated as “rice field”. Therefore, Japanese players will associate the two. In addition, many “草 (kusa)” Internet buzzwords suddenly appeared in Japan in 2022 because the Romaji of “笑 (warai - laugh)” in Japanese is “warau”, so “www” is used to express laughter, and “w” looks like a bunch of grass, so “笑 (warai)” is replaced by “草 (kusa)” in Japanese Internet buzzwords.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to translate the “slang” in the game well, you must first be among the player groups, understand the local culture, and understand what kind of terms players in the target market will use in their daily lives, and what the structure of these terms is. When literal translation is not possible, by tracing the composition of the term and translating its origin, the word can be translated more accurately. This requires actively participating in the community of the target language during localization, mastering the rules of “slang” in a large number of daily communication with players, becoming familiar with the local culture, understanding the cultural differences between the two countries, and striving to break through cultural barriers.</p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>At present, domestic games are booming in overseas markets, but for mature markets such as Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States, local game manufacturers or global top manufacturers have generally been deeply involved for many years and have strong competitive barriers. Coupled with the cultural differences between the two places, the competitiveness of the overseas expansion of domestic games has gradually increased. Domestic games can build a bridge of communication between players of the two languages through localization, reduce cultural barriers through localization, spread excellent culture, so that games not only “go out” overseas, but also “stand firm”. Through localization, games can be culturally empowered, and appropriate “slang” can form another link between games and players, and players and players.</p>

    <title>How Localization Shapes Character Image - Taking Japanese Localization as an Example</title>

<h2 id="1-Localization-and-Character-Image"><a href="#1-Localization-and-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="1. Localization and Character Image"></a>1. Localization and Character Image</h2><p>Localization is the process of adapting a product or service to the differences of different markets. It is often confused with translation, but it actually goes far beyond the scope of translation. Translation is only one of several services that make up the localization process.</p>
<p>In addition to translation, the localization process may also include adjusting graphics according to the target market, modifying the content layout to adapt to the translated text, converting to local currency, using the correct date, address, and data formats, adapting to local regulations, interface and skin adjustments, etc. The object of localization is the “product”, not just the “text”; this process also includes two aspects: language and culture (including social background).</p>
<p>In the localization of game products, the process is, in a sense, a re-creation of the game content (such as character image). There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes. Even people in the same language environment cannot reach a consensus on the same thing, and it is even more difficult for people in different languages and regions to have the same understanding of the same thing. Therefore, in addition to the character image created by the original language, the shaping of the character image by the target language is particularly important.</p>
<p>A successful re-creation of the character image must be an indispensable part of successful localization. However, while re-creating the character image, the localization process must not deviate from the original image of the character (that is, the character image in the original language). This is because localization not only needs to meet the requirements of the target market, but also needs to carry the information of the original language and the original game itself. In this way, how to shape a “new image” that is close to the character’s original image becomes a problem. This is a challenge of “dancing in shackles”, and it is also an opportunity to gain both overseas market revenue and the inheritance of national culture.</p>
<h2 id="2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture"><a href="#2-Localization-Strategies-for-Language-and-Culture" class="headerlink" title="2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture"></a>2. Localization Strategies for Language and Culture</h2><h3 id="Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits"><a href="#Language-Localization-Domestication-of-Language-Usage-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits"></a>Language Localization: Domestication of Language Usage Habits</h3><p>The localization of the language itself is often understood as localization translation, which is only one aspect. When it comes to the standards of Chinese people for translation, it is impossible to avoid Yan Fu’s “faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance” mentioned in “Evolution and Ethics”. In the process of localizing the background, plot, lines, etc. related to the character image, this standard will also be referred to. “Faithfulness means truth, and truth means non-falsehood; expressiveness means attainment, and attainment means neither excess nor deficiency; elegance means literariness, and literariness means being elegant when it should be elegant and being vulgar when it should be vulgar.”</p>
<p>Lawrence Venuti put forward the concepts of domestication and foreignization in his book <em>The Translator’s Invisibility: A History of Translation</em>. Domestication emphasizes reducing the sense of strangeness in the target language, while foreignization preserves the exotic elements in the original language.</p>
<p>In language localization, if you want to ensure that the character image is close to the prototype, you must first ensure the correctness of the language itself, including no grammatical errors, no deviations in word interpretation. This is the basis of all localization and translation. If the foundation is not strong, the character image on the upper level will also shake. After ensuring the correctness of the language itself, what needs to be done is “expressiveness”, neither excess nor deficiency.</p>
<p>In the current era of big data, with the help of AI translation and the excellent quality monitoring of the localization team, the correctness and quality of the language can be well guaranteed in most cases and scenarios, so “faithfulness” and “expressiveness” are no longer difficult.</p>
<p>The final “elegance” is the key factor that determines whether a localization result is of high quality in this era. How to analyze, discuss, and reshape the style, usage habits, and the character image behind the original language, and apply it to the target language, so that the target language population (that is, game players in countries and regions that use the target language) can feel that the translated language is not awkward, then it can be called a successful localization.</p>
<p>For example, in the Japanese original of <em>Blue Archive</em>, Iori calls Aiko “アコちゃん”, which is often translated as “A-ko chan” in anime scenarios, but the localization team of the simplified Chinese version translated it as “Aya”(亚亚). Obviously, the localization here removes the influence of Japanese usage habits without reducing Iori’s original intimacy with the members of the Gehenna Prefect Team. This localized translation even reminds people of the names of giant pandas, which has a strong Chinese flavor. In a sense, it can be called a successful localization attempt. </p>

<h3 id="Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors"><a href="#Cultural-Localization-Foreignization-of-Historical-and-Cultural-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors"></a>Cultural Localization: Foreignization of Historical and Cultural Factors</h3><p>Cultural localization is different from language localization. If language localization requires the character image to be as close as possible to the target language user group, then cultural localization requires the character image to maintain a certain distance from the target group in some aspects. In our view, we must provide players with a reason to play our games.</p>
<p>Why would a player in a country choose not to play their own country’s games, but to choose a game from a foreign manufacturer? There can be many reasons for this, such as rich gameplay&#x2F;playability, extremely high picture quality, vivid story background&#x2F;character plot, comprehensive user service, etc. Of course, many players themselves are only loyal to the game category and overall quality, and do not care about the developer’s region. However, in the world of games, which highly emphasizes subjective user experience, how to enter the player’s mind is decisive. At this time, if a game can bring players a foreign cultural experience that starts with curiosity and ends with dissemination, it can clearly distinguish this game from other games; and it is this differentiation that can make a game from a foreign country for players stand out. At this time, the character image should be closer to the background story of the original language, rather than the environment of the target language. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230904%2F04f8d0ab-8f9a-4886-9659-6ab5b04698eb.png/size/"></p>
<p>For example, in the preheating story of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Yoto Hime, there is such a passage: “Beast?” The girl seemed to have heard something very interesting, and couldn’t help laughing softly.</p>
<p>The first version of the Japanese translation was: 「ペット？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>However, considering that <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is based on a fictional ancient Chinese fantasy and martial arts world, the word ペット in Japanese is derived from the English word pet, which reflects the epitome of English’s influence in the world. Therefore, after consideration, we changed this passage to:</p>
<p>「飼い犬？」少女はなにか面白いことを聞いたかのように、思わず笑った。</p>
<p>Here, 飼い犬 is often translated as a domestic dog, which is closer to the Eastern worldview of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> than pet, and the character image of Yoto Hime in this worldview can be better shaped. Indeed, in terms of language usage habits, for Japanese people, the word pet is more commonly used and more everyday than domestic dog. But as mentioned above, how can a game localization that cannot be distinguished from other games and cannot bring players a sense of foreign culture break through the vast game market today? Therefore, the localization process here must follow the principle of foreignization of historical and cultural factors to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Looking back, the translation of “Aya” in <em>Blue Archive</em> mentioned above does achieve language localization, but it seems to have eliminated most of the cultural perception of anime, which may bring some players a sense of separation between the picture and the characters.</p>
<h2 id="3-Successful-Localization-Cases"><a href="#3-Successful-Localization-Cases" class="headerlink" title="3. Successful Localization Cases"></a>3. Successful Localization Cases</h2><p>How do successful cases make the character image more popular with the local audience through localization? Here are some examples of Japanese localization and translation to better understand the two key points of shaping the character image: domestication of language usage habits and foreignization of historical and cultural factors.</p>
<p>Yoto Hime of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is portrayed in the game as a princess&#x2F;lady whose underlying logic is to find “fun”. Therefore, there are a lot of Japanese final particles (language usage habits) such as わ, よ, かしら, じゃない in the script to reflect this princess persona. The following is also a passage from Yoto Hime’s preheating story:</p>
<p>“He said yesterday that he never believed in ghosts and gods. I wanted to see if it was true~ Who knew that it would be amazing once I tried. I can’t really accept him as a disciple, so I had to let this beggar receive his bows for me.”</p>
<p>「あの奴、昨日自分で言ったでしょ、鬼神の説を信じていないって。だから本当かどうかを見てみたいわ。試した結果、大変なことになっちゃったわよ。ほら、私は彼を本当に弟子にするのもいかないし、物乞いくんに拝礼を受けてもらうしかないわ。」</p>
<p>However, in the first version of the preheating story, this persona was only reflected in Yoto Hime’s actions in the plot, and her unique style was not shown in her lines. After discussion by the localization team, these simple modal final particles were finally added according to Yoto Hime’s persona in the script, shaping Yoto Hime who is close to the original persona at the language level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230904%2F3ed77793-f22e-4be9-a882-87b723f15344.jpg/size/"></p>
<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>In all the above examples, it seems that the localization discusses and纠结s over only one or two words or pronunciations. In fact, whether it is the image of a character, or the game background and world created by various characters, and even the entire game, will be affected by these seemingly insignificant, accumulated details. The character image reshaped by localization must show the characteristics of being close to the original language but not rigid, and being compatible with the target language but vivid in insignificant places.</p>
<p>Therefore, in localization work, the more insignificant the place, the more effort should be made to ensure the rigor of the localization work. Although the behavior of the character itself is ever-changing, the behavioral logic behind the character should be consistent, and the identity of the character we create should also be the same and continuous. The consistency of the appropriate expression of the same thing between different languages is also something we should firmly grasp.</p>

<p>Text in games runs through the core gameplay and functional interfaces at all levels. The information transmission and emotional expression it achieves are key elements in game interaction. This article analyzes the characteristics of font design in excellent game works at home and abroad under different themes, and discusses how to choose the basic tone of fonts and the integration of font design and game worldview according to the style of different games. In addition, we will also explain the relevant information about game font localization and commercial costs. These contents are intended to provide game developers with ideas and references for font selection and design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Font-Classification"><a href="#1-Font-Classification" class="headerlink" title="1. Font Classification"></a>1. Font Classification</h2><p>There are many ways to classify fonts, such as handwriting, printing, and artistic fonts… etc. The most discussed classification method is “serif and sans-serif”. In layman’s terms, serifs are also known as “feet”. Serif fonts are fonts with corner decorations. As can be clearly seen from the figure below, at the same font size, the angular sans-serif font looks larger and clearer than the serif font. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F74e0f603-d52b-494c-9f8f-140a84d15820.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 1. Comparison of Serif and Sans-serif Fonts</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Serif"><a href="#Serif" class="headerlink" title="Serif"></a>Serif</h3><p>It is generally believed that serif fonts originated from Roman stone inscriptions. The modern explanation for these decorative strokes, which is accepted by most people, comes from Father Edward Catich’s book “The Origin of the Serif”. The book believes that Roman letters were first written with a square-tipped brush before being carved into stone tablets. Due to the use of a square-tipped brush, the strokes would have uneven strokes at the beginning and end, so finishing actions were added at the beginning, end, and corners of the strokes. The engravers carved according to the written samples, which naturally formed the “serif” serif font.</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese characters, such as Song typeface, at the junction of strokes, the beginning of vertical strokes and the end of horizontal strokes, due to the return and pause of the brush when writing calligraphy, a unique triangular structure is formed, which can also be called “serif”.</p>
<h3 id="Sans-serif"><a href="#Sans-serif" class="headerlink" title="Sans-serif"></a>Sans-serif</h3><p>In the era of electronic screens, the display of Chinese characters does not need the original function of “serif” but only retains its decorative nature. However, in the case of a large amount of text information input&#x2F;output on the Internet, too many embellishments on the strokes of serif fonts can easily cause visual fatigue. Sans-serif fonts, contrary to serif fonts, have no decorative lines or small horizontal lines similar to “small feet” in their glyphs, and the text is usually composed of mechanical and uniform lines.</p>
<p>There is no unified rule when choosing fonts, but there are some default norms. For example, long-form reading or small-screen information displays prefer to use sans-serif fonts; while titles or small-scale texts prefer serif fonts to enhance the beauty of short sentences. Moreover, in many scenarios, more irregular artistic fonts are needed to render the atmosphere of the game or achieve specific effects.</p>
<h2 id="2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#2-Selection-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="2. Selection of Game Fonts"></a>2. Selection of Game Fonts</h2><h3 id="Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone"><a href="#Game-Style-Determines-the-Basic-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Game Style Determines the Basic Tone"></a>Game Style Determines the Basic Tone</h3><p>In the selection and design of game fonts, it is necessary to consider the game style, type, main audience, and the good integration within the different systems in the game and the game worldview. However, there are many ways to classify game styles, and it is difficult to find a specific classification method to cover all game types and styles. Here, some examples with obvious contrasts are used to illustrate the differences in the form of different fonts and the selection principles.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay type, games that are more mysterious and magical usually prefer serif fonts, while action games that emphasize fast pace and dynamism will prefer sans-serif fonts to reflect a crisp power; Chinese style games and styles that are more realistic and nostalgic always prefer serif fonts to create a real, profound and immersive atmosphere; while sci-fi and anime games emphasize exploration and technology, and choosing sans-serif fonts will be more compatible with them; for children’s games, cartoon and simple sans-serif fonts are usually the first choice. </p>

<p>If the worldview of the game has not been determined during the design process, you can initially choose a suitable basic font tone by combining the keyword list provided in the figure below. Generally speaking, sans-serif fonts are suitable for modern, concise, technological and other game styles; while serif fonts are more suitable for traditional, ancient, Gothic fantasy and other game styles. There is no clear boundary for the selection of fonts. On the basis of ensuring information transmission, it is often pursued to create a visual performance effect that is more in line with the game worldview. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Figure 3. Correspondence between game style keywords and font selection recommendations</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, choosing sans-serif or serif as the main font of the game does not mean that all text content in the game is immutable. There are also various font classifications in the game, and it is often necessary to mix and use multiple fonts.</p>
<h3 id="System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts"><a href="#System-Fonts-and-Artistic-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="System Fonts and Artistic Fonts"></a>System Fonts and Artistic Fonts</h3><p>Whether it is a serif font or a sans-serif font, it needs to be authorized before it can be legally used as the system font of the game. Due to the size and compression restrictions of the game package, too many fonts cannot be placed in the game, and usually one font is selected for each of the title font and the system font. However, it would be a bit monotonous if all the text in the game only uses the system font, so developers need to make a trade-off in the use of fonts.</p>
<p>In order to meet some special needs in the game, such as event titles, game names, etc., developers may need to use some artistic fonts or handwritten fonts. Artistic fonts are sometimes deformations and modifications of existing fonts, and sometimes they are more complex changes; while handwritten fonts are usually more natural, softer, and more stylized, and sometimes designed by professional calligraphers.</p>
<p>So, how should we choose system fonts or artistic fonts? We should consider the role of text in the game. Text with different functions will have different designs and processing methods. In general, the fewer types of fonts used in game interface design, the better. As much as possible, visual hierarchy principles, such as different weights, styles, sizes, directions, positions, and colors of fonts, should be used to reflect differences in importance.</p>
<h3 id="Integration-with-the-In-Game-World"><a href="#Integration-with-the-In-Game-World" class="headerlink" title="Integration with the In-Game World"></a>Integration with the In-Game World</h3><p>● <strong>Main System Font - Integration</strong></p>
<p>The system fonts in the game, such as game menus, game situation, task information, etc., as a strong functional existence, provide players with a series of main information such as character data, items, levels, and task objectives. Part of this information will always appear on the main game interface, such as the game’s HUD (Heads-up Display). The display of another part of the information involves interaction with other functional controls or changes in interaction levels. In both cases, designers need to think about how to integrate the text in the game with other visual hierarchy structures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F249f97c7-1195-49ff-9ec3-73511413039b.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 4. Precautions and examples of game system font design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Designers often simplify the text information in the game HUD to make the most important information or functions visually visible. However, when players open the menu bar and other secondary interfaces, they often need to read and digest a large amount of data information at one time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F48cf773a-997b-4907-8943-e86c7865292d.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 5. HUD design considerations and case sharing</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When page level jumps or Tab switching is required, in order to avoid a blunt transition between the scene interface and the text interface, usually not only the font itself is used to match the style, but different dynamic effects, display styles, art packaging, and font effect designs are used to add visual effects. In the selection of fonts, it is necessary to make subtle distinctions based on primary and secondary information, but it should not be too fragmented. This can create a more coherent and harmonious gaming experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F15557e12-fea6-4828-847d-af4a17ee3ac3.png/size/"></p>

<p>● <strong>Subtitles and Dialogue - Role Immersion</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle text is an indispensable part of games with storylines. It can play a role in promoting the plot and helping players enter the role. The design of subtitles needs to avoid stealing the limelight of the picture, and at the same time, it needs to ensure that the font is clear and visible. This requires that the font should not be too compact or too small to increase the difficulty of reading and understanding, and at the same time, it should not be too long or occupy too much space, so as not to affect the advancement of the game plot and the immersive experience of the player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F52f7c7d8-97ac-4bfb-8f50-1dabda9fbe42.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 7. Precautions and examples of game dialogue and subtitle design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Posters and Packaging - Brand Impression</strong></p>
<p>Using the system default font can meet the text needs on the conventional interface, but it is slightly inferior to some special occasions that require exaggerated design font effects. The game logo and promotional posters are important identifiers of the game brand, and are the first impression of a game. They need to clearly convey the core concept and characteristics of the game, and at the same time, they should also provide players with a reference standard for the overall tone of the game. Many game logos consist only of the game name, which requires that they cannot be too complicated, otherwise it will increase the difficulty of memory, and at the same time, they need to be highly stylized. In addition, when designing, it is also necessary to consider the logo changes in different languages to ensure that the game has better awareness and playability in different regions and cultures.</p>
<p>At this time, we need to use custom fonts, which are what we often call artistic fonts. Artistic fonts require artists to make a separate picture text and paste it in a designated position to replace the traditional text. This picture text often contains exaggerated deformation of the original font, adding a unique style and avoiding infringement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2Ff10ee232-56ad-48d7-af00-2f2b21879769.png/size/"></p>

<p>● <strong>Core Gameplay Font - Motivation and Ritual</strong></p>
<p>In the design of core gameplay, how to balance a large amount of related information and the display of main information is very important. In the case of a fast-paced core gameplay, it is necessary to first clarify the importance of information grading, and select the corresponding game font style and arrangement method according to different gradings. In addition, in the core gameplay, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of non-static factors such as dynamic effects and scenes on the transmission of text information, so as to better convey information.</p>
<p>Almost all games have initialization and settlement settings. How to stimulate the player’s motivation and sense of ritual, and provide just the right sense of frustration when necessary, so that they can re-challenge the task, is a key issue that interface designers need to focus on. The font design at this time often pursues the first-time instinctive perception of information, rather than the content conveyed by the text. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F3f494623-94cf-4ab8-b423-88407feeca26.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Figure 9. Precautions and examples of game core gameplay information transmission design</em></p>
<hr>
<p>● <strong>Summary - Balance of Readability and Stylization</strong></p>
<p>Through the analysis of this section, it can be found that the main goals of different types of fonts in the game to transmit information are also different. The selection of the overall game font needs to pay attention to the balance of readability and stylization.</p>
<p>For the system fonts in the game, the primary goal is to clearly convey information. At this time, it is necessary to focus on improving readability and legibility without affecting the continuity of the player’s operation and causing a lack of immersion.</p>
<p>For the artistic fonts in the game, it is more to highlight the personality of the game, attract the attention, recognition and interest of players. The readability of these artistic fonts is not always the higher the better. Sometimes appropriately weakening the font content and strengthening its visual impact, achieving the integration of text information and dynamic effects, etc., can deepen the player’s immersion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fonts in the game also need to follow certain principles. For example, in game design, information at the same level needs to be unified in terms of font size, color, font shape, and font style to reduce the user’s identification and cognitive burden. In addition, the legibility and usability of the font are very important. Doing this well can avoid causing reading or operation obstacles to the player, affecting the fluency of the game experience, and thus making more contributions to retention.</p>
<h2 id="3-Game-Font-Localization"><a href="#3-Game-Font-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3. Game Font Localization"></a>3. Game Font Localization</h2><p>When different readers see this article, the display font comes from your specific system, and the system font libraries of different platforms often differ, which will lead to differences in the reading experience of the same product on different platforms. For a product like a game that focuses on the overall experience, calling the fonts of the system platform sometimes has two problems:</p>
<p>● In a single-language system, if localization is not performed, it may cause the font to fail to display, rare fonts to be missing or garbled, etc., destroying the original beauty of the interface, affecting understanding, and causing players to lose immersion.</p>
<p>● When it comes to multi-language systems, it is necessary to ensure that the selected font is equipped with a complete character set for each language and can be presented in a clear and aesthetically pleasing way. Localization at this time not only needs to consider the accuracy of the translation, but also needs to consider the impact of factors such as market development, user habits, cultural and religious differences on the acceptance of the product.</p>
<p>This article only discusses the problem of inconsistent font display. The solution to this problem is to copy the font to the project and let the engine support reading the font from its own project, so that the platform difference can be eliminated and the design effect can be displayed consistently on all platforms. This is the current solution for various game engines. Some game studios may produce or purchase new system fonts for specific regions to meet the needs of different language regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20230911%2F91df51ac-2461-4476-8d64-8869dc75f4bd.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Figure 10. Localization problems and solutions currently faced</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For designers, there are two aspects of font localization that are worth thinking about:</p>
<p>● For special language symbols, it is necessary to consider the production method of picture words and the replacement under different languages, and pay attention to the possible changes in size and estimated distance, and provide a consistent and complete game experience on different types of devices.</p>
<p>● When arranging text such as tabs or titles, fully consider the impact of different language habits on the visual effect. For example, a vertical arrangement that can be clearly displayed in Chinese or Japanese may not be suitable for Western languages. The writing style of Arabic is from right to left, and it is necessary to consider the arrangement and alignment in special cases, and also to consider the impact of the differences in reading habits of different players on the game experience.</p>
<p>As game development progresses rapidly, many designers are committed to solving these problems, so many excellent developer plugins have emerged, such as the Unity plugin “ThunderFire UX Tool”. ThunderFire UX Tool localization tool supports the configuration and content replacement of 14 languages including Thai and Arabic. It can import and identify multi-language text and artistic font pictures with one click, and can quickly preview and switch in the editor, providing a complete set of procedural localization and font solutions for interaction, translation, and programming. </p>

<h2 id="4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts"><a href="#4-Commercial-Cost-of-Game-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts"></a>4. Commercial Cost of Game Fonts</h2><p>When choosing game fonts, commercial costs usually include design, licensing, and maintenance costs. Developers need to budget and plan within a reasonable range and comply with relevant licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Game font licensing is usually divided into two types: game image licensing and game embedding. Game image licensing applies the image form of the font to game software or poster products, the price is relatively low, and the frequency of use is low. Game embedding is to embed the font as a whole into the game system as a system font, and the price is higher. Game embedding needs to meet more usage specifications and requirements, including the stability and compatibility of the font in the game system. The licensing price will also vary according to the completeness of the font family package and the national standard type.</p>
<p>The specific licensing price will also be affected by the font design itself, such as the exquisiteness of the font, the copyright period, popularity, and aesthetics. Therefore, when conducting font licensing, developers need to fully communicate and negotiate with the font licensor to determine a reasonable licensing price and usage method, and scope of application.</p>
<p>When borrowing unlicensed fonts, it is necessary to pay attention to the deformation of the fonts to avoid violating relevant agreements. When it is necessary to use fonts similar to picture fonts in the game, fonts with very large deformations are often used to make artistic fonts to increase the aesthetics and reduce the risk of use.</p>
<h2 id="5-Summary"><a href="#5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="5. Summary"></a>5. Summary</h2><p>For game players, excellent font selection and design can allow players to easily understand the text information in the game without causing doubts. Sometimes, the player’s ignorance of the text in the game can reflect the success of the text design. Developers choosing the right font not only needs to consider the coordination of the game’s worldview and the overall style of the game, but also needs to consider multi-dimensional issues such as font iteration authorization and localization to enhance the quality and user experience of the game.</p>

    <title>Text Overflow - The Old Problem of Game Localization</title>
    <url>/2023/09/19/netease-ux-articles/news_20231008_28584_1113543/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231008/28584_1113543.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Localization translation and interface adaptation are indispensable parts of the process of launching a game overseas. However, some troublesome problems are often encountered in this process. One of the most common problems is that many foreign language expressions are much longer in characters than the corresponding Chinese, causing the translated text to exceed the originally designed UI, icon, or text box, resulting in incomplete display.</p>
<p>This situation hinders players’ understanding, and at the same time greatly reduces the sense of quality of the game in the minds of overseas players, which has a negative impact on retention and reputation. Localization translators always hope to accurately reproduce the meaning of the original language and maintain the original flavor as much as possible, achieving faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance, but they often feel helpless because of the length of foreign language expressions.</p>
<h2 id="1-Length-Comparison-of-Different-Languages"><a href="#1-Length-Comparison-of-Different-Languages" class="headerlink" title="1. Length Comparison of Different Languages"></a>1. Length Comparison of Different Languages</h2><p>Languages of different countries have their own unique writing norms, and the same is true in the localization of games. When performing localization translation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the fields involved to ensure the accuracy of the translation and the integrity of the semantics.</p>
<p>However, different languages have a general ratio of words when translated. For example, the ratio of English translated into Chinese is 1:1.6, while the ratio of Japanese and Korean translated into Chinese is about 1:1. In contrast, the text of some minor European languages is much longer. The ratio of German and French translated into Chinese is 1:1.8, and the ratio of Russian, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Arabic translated into Chinese is as high as 1:2. The higher the word count ratio, the easier it is to cause the problem of translated text exceeding the box during the localization process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb430dff5-5c1c-479e-b84f-33700c328842.png/size/"></p>
<p>Taking <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, which is handled by the localization team under NetEase Leihuo UX, as an example, we analyzed the number of characters in the foreign language text and the number of characters in the Chinese text of the game, and obtained the risk of text exceeding the box in different languages in the game, as shown in the figure below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F147aa651-7f19-40a7-87b1-1c2058316515.png/size/"></p>
<p>It can be seen that the risk of text exceeding the box in all 11 languages in the figure is greater than 50%. Japanese and Korean have about 60% probability of seeing the text window, while European minor languages are almost “completely wiped out”, becoming the hardest hit areas for exceeding the box, with a probability close to 80%. Therefore, it can be said that how to face and solve the problem of text exceeding the box during game localization is a “long-standing” problem faced by every language.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-Reduce-the-Risk-of-Exceeding-the-Box"><a href="#2-How-to-Reduce-the-Risk-of-Exceeding-the-Box" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Reduce the Risk of Exceeding the Box?"></a>2. How to Reduce the Risk of Exceeding the Box?</h2><p>Although exceeding the box is a major problem that often occurs in the localization process of games, after years of exploration and experience accumulation, and in-depth exploration with technical team members, we can still find some potential methods to minimize the risk of exceeding the box of localized text in various languages, and even avoid this problem from the source as much as possible, so as to ensure the basic understanding and game experience of players in different countries and regions.</p>
<h3 id="Game-Development-Stage"><a href="#Game-Development-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Game Development Stage"></a>Game Development Stage</h3><p>• <strong>Prepare for multiple languages when designing text boxes in the UI</strong></p>
<p>If the game is intended to be released overseas at the beginning of its development, the UI team can comprehensively consider it in conjunction with the localization team at the beginning of the design. On the premise of ensuring interface design and interaction effects, the original text box can be appropriately expanded according to the length ratio of multiple languages to increase the text tolerance threshold of different languages.</p>
<p>• <strong>Design scrolling effects for text boxes</strong></p>
<p>Some Chinese expressions are very concise, using multiple compound sentences in just a few sentences, or having a strong classical Chinese nature (such as poems, ancient Chinese styles, etc.). Therefore, during the translation process, the number of characters in foreign languages may be 2-3 times longer than that of Chinese. In this case, when localizing game text, it is difficult for translators to significantly reduce the translation while retaining the original meaning. If the text box in the game is limited by the interface width and cannot be further expanded, you can consider making the text scroll to avoid the problem of exceeding the box.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to this approach. Scrolling text can theoretically play text of any length and has strong inclusiveness; at the same time, there is no need to adjust the font and font size of the text, and the length of the text box does not need to be expanded to the maximum extent that the interface can bear; players can generally obtain and understand the information that the game wants to provide from the scrolling text.</p>
<p>Of course, considering the current mainstream games at home and abroad, the design of scrolling text generally appears in the game in task names, equipment introductions, etc., and is not suitable for the problem of exceeding the box in all positions and content forms. Some of the reasons include that scrolling some text technically and programmatically will lead to reduced game performance and increased overhead, and when the text that requires context understanding is too long, it is easier to increase understanding barriers and reduce the reading experience.</p>
<p>• <strong>Give character length suggestions</strong></p>
<p>Compared with directly expanding the text box in UI design in the early stage of the project, giving text character length suggestions and finding the method of the longest character number can improve certain flexibility. Because this method can give more design space to UI and interaction, and at the same time, it can also minimize the risk of exceeding the box of the original Chinese (copywriting planners, system planners, etc. also know this character number suggestion) and localized translation.</p>
<p>However, there are two points to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The impact of resolution on text length:</strong> Text that has no problems may exceed the box and display incompletely after changing the resolution. Or, some fonts have been adjusted to the smallest font size, even if the adaptive (best fit, can adjust the font size or wrap) is turned on, the font size cannot be further reduced when the resolution is lowered.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F74b8e32c-f86d-4771-850c-7b7fdbe2af97.png/size/"></p>
<p>Therefore, when the UI team gives suggestions on the length of text characters for text boxes, it is best to consider the various resolutions supported by the game in combination with the different platforms on which the game is launched.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>The impact of fonts:</strong> Even within the same language, different fonts will have a relatively obvious impact on the length of the displayed text. As shown below, the font of the first line of English is Arial, and the font of the second line of English is Times New Roman.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb5401acf-fb1a-4c76-8179-b6e18ecb82f9.png/size/"></p>
<p>It can be clearly seen that the length of the same text will be different if it is displayed in different fonts. Therefore, if only a character limit is given, such as 4 characters, the translator uses a different font from the developer when using excel or other translation software, the length of the translation is likely to be different from the standard character length given by the development team.</p>
<p>Let’s give another example: the developer set a maximum of 23 characters for a button in the game, and the font from the developer’s perspective is Times New Roman. The translator set the font to Arial when performing localization in the translation system. The translator translates the text in this button as:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;nbsp; 
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F390df84a-d821-4ebf-b9fa-892c4ce0d6f1.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>It can be seen that although the translator’s translation is exactly 23 characters, it still exceeds the box by one letter.</p>
<p>Even if the upstream and downstream departments unify the font, simply giving a character limit is still not necessarily the most recommended solution. Because different translators have different translation habits and commonly used words, the same sentence will have multiple translations. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buy this with gold</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With gold unlock it</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that the number of characters in both translations is 18, but the following sentence exceeds the box by one letter compared to the above sentence. This problem will be more obvious in longer compound sentences.</p>
<p>Therefore, the UI team can give character length suggestions based on “m, n”. For example, the length of a button is “mmmmmmn”. At this time, no matter what font or expression the translator uses, they only need to compare the length with “mmmmmmn” to determine whether there is a risk of exceeding the box.</p>
<h3 id="Localization-Translation-Stage"><a href="#Localization-Translation-Stage" class="headerlink" title="Localization Translation Stage"></a>Localization Translation Stage</h3><p>In addition to the early operation of reducing the risk of text exceeding the box during the development and design stage of the game, the translation during the localization process is also an important stage to ensure that the game interface finally presented to overseas players does not exceed the box.</p>
<p>• First of all, translators need to have enough understanding of the game content to be able to identify the possible location of the text during the translation stage and appropriately streamline the translation.</p>
<p>For example, “Unlock in time-limited event”, a new translator may translate it as “You can unlock this item by the time-limited event”; and a translator who knows the game well enough can immediately judge that this sentence is likely to appear in a certain prop, the unlocking method interface (button) of a certain item, usually a small text box, so it can be directly translated as “Unlock by time-limited event”.</p>
<p>• Use abbreviations instead of full spelling</p>
<p>This method is common in secondary interfaces or later in the game (players have a prior understanding of the full spelling), and can also reduce the risk of text exceeding the box with high efficiency. Common abbreviations include: damage-DMG; attack-ATK; experience-EXP, etc.</p>
<p>• Split sentences and reduce the use of conjunctions and prepositions during the localization process.</p>
<p>For example, the translation of the following sentence: 奧义状态下再造成100点伤害提升至第3级.</p>
<p>Dealing 100 damage by Hero’s Ultimate state and then raising to level 3.</p>
<p>Upgrade to Lv.3: Deal 100 more damage by Hero’s Ultimate</p>
<p>This translation divides the original complex expression into two sentences, avoiding the use of lengthy and difficult-to-understand compound sentences, which not only simplifies the translation, but also reduces the reading cost of players.</p>
<h2 id="3-Summary"><a href="#3-Summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Summary"></a>3. Summary</h2><p>The problem of exceeding the box during the game localization translation process may be common in games on different platforms. We also found that this is a common problem in various languages, which not only affects the playability of the game and player reputation, but may also further hinder the retention of the game. Based on the experience of previous projects, we propose some solutions, aiming to avoid the problem of text exceeding the box as much as possible during the development and localization process of the game.</p>
<p>First of all, we recommend that the localization issues be considered jointly by various functions at the game development stage, including UI, GUI, localization, planning, programming, etc. This means that the design of the game must take into account the differences between different languages and cultures from the beginning to ensure the playability and consistency of the game in different languages. Secondly, during the translation process, we recommend using professional translation software and tools to help identify and correct the problem of exceeding the box to ensure the accuracy and quality of the translation and improve the player experience.</p>
<p>In short, the problem of exceeding the box is one of the challenges that must be faced in game localization. By taking appropriate measures during the development and translation process of the game, these problems can be avoided to the greatest extent, and a better game experience can be provided for players around the world.</p>

    <title>Expanding Design Principles: How Does Emotion Affect Game Experience?</title>
    <url>/2023/09/22/netease-ux-articles/news_20231008_28584_1113540/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231008/28584_1113540.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>With the maturity of product design and manufacturers’ development capabilities, users are increasingly paying attention to the emotional experience that products bring to them. At the same time, more and more games are not only pursuing momentary excitement, pure visual and operational experience, but also fully considering and satisfying users’ emotional needs as much as possible, and are more pursuing users’ spiritual pleasure, value and emotional recognition. This article will start from the perspective of emotional design, explore its role and application methods in the field of game experience design, in order to optimize user experience through emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="1-What-is-Emotional-Design"><a href="#1-What-is-Emotional-Design" class="headerlink" title="1. What is Emotional Design?"></a>1. What is Emotional Design?</h2><p>Emotions are complex and changeable, but the patterns that cause emotions are general and regular; and emotional design is to use these patterns to purposefully cause people’s emotional reactions, through various shapes, colors, textures and other modeling elements, emotions are integrated into the game experience, in the process of consumers experiencing products, to stimulate people’s associations, resonate, and obtain spiritual pleasure and emotional satisfaction.</p>
<p>Emotion is a mandatory and oppressive experience. Converting consumers’ activities, thoughts, feelings, desires, goals, habits, and values into design will trigger positive emotional responses from users. The book “Emotional Design” clearly divides design and design goals into three levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective, and expounds the important position and role of emotion in design. It serves as a conceptual supplement in the fields of software, interaction, and game design. Therefore, when we design any product, we need to respect emotional needs and bring a deeper level of quality experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

The Role of Emotional Design in Experience Design"></a>2. The Role of Emotional Design in Experience Design</h2><h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Visceral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Visceral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Visceral Experience</h3><p>The visceral level refers to the sensory stimulation that the product brings to people. The emotional response that the product looks, sounds, and feels to the user is the first step for design to generate value. Through the design of pictures, colors, layouts, sounds, textures, and tactile feedback, the product features can be visually reflected and bring specific emotional experiences to users.</p>
<p>For example, the beautiful pictures in the game make people feel dazzling and colorful, or red reminds people of blood, sun, and fire, giving people a feeling of excitement, jumping, and alertness, causing physiological excitement and stimulation. These are all visceral designs of the game that are acting on the visual experience of players.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Behavioral-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Behavioral Experience</h3><p>The behavioral level refers to the fact that users must learn and master skills, use skills to solve problems, and trigger emotions, gain a sense of accomplishment and pleasure from the experience. It is aimed at the user’s experience. For example, in the game, players need to gradually master the game rules preset by the designer, and use them to fight against other players or computer opponents to strive for victory. The experience of the behavioral layer is the core of game interaction design, which can allow users to obtain a positive emotional experience. Therefore, it is necessary to provide clear goals, instant feedback, and appropriate challenges; it is necessary to design an easy-to-understand conceptual model that conforms to the four elements of function, ease of understanding, ease of use, and physical feeling of behavioral design, so that users can use it easily, and always pay attention to the user’s experience throughout the process.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb3f3464b-e46f-4f61-8073-738c16162324.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience"><a href="#Emotion-Affects-Reflective-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Emotion Affects Reflective Experience"></a>Emotion Affects Reflective Experience</h3><p>Finally, there is the reflective layer, which refers to the deeper emotions, consciousness, understanding, personal experience, cultural background and other influences that are intertwined in the user’s heart due to the effects of the first two levels, the user transforms and associates certain potential information and characteristics contained in things, and projects them into life experience. For games, the content of the game and the implied information conveyed by the storyline will stimulate players to recall and reflect, integrating out-of-game experience and in-game feelings to create a more immersive experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<hr>
<p>The experience brought to users by excellent reflective emotional design determines the connotation, meaning and user stickiness of the product; when the emotional experience meets the user’s long-term goals and conveys a clear and consistent personality, it is more likely that users will truly like such an experience in a meaningful way, and voluntarily and actively form a lasting and loyal connection with the brand or IP.</p>

How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience"></a>3. How to Use Emotional Design to Create Game Experience</h2><h3 id="Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience"><a href="#Visceral-Attraction-Triggers-Emotional-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience"></a>Visceral Attraction Triggers Emotional Experience</h3><p>At the visceral level, physical characteristics—visual, auditory, and tactile—dominate, so creating visual, auditory, and tactile appeal is an important factor in getting users’ favor and attracting users’ attention at the visceral level of the game.</p>
<p>So how to create multi-sensory appeal?</p>
<p>Designers can refine relevant characteristic elements, such as regional characteristics, character characteristics, etc., to expand the game from pure senses and aesthetics to the fields of semantics and culture, occupy users’ cognitive resources at the visceral level, guide users’ emotions, and attract users’ attention. Among them, vision, as the most basic perception channel, is the beginning of the user’s game experience. Using characteristic elements familiar to users can stimulate users’ “value resonance”, thereby affecting the generation of immersive emotional experience.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>All-Star Streetball Party</em>, the exquisite interface design incorporates a large number of street basketball elements. From the personalized graffiti-style interface to the cool and trendy sneakers and fashions, these elements contain the collective memory of basketball fans and can also attract general users who are interested in streetball culture. These elements can quickly occupy users’ cognitive resources from the visual channel, arouse associations and imagination, activate users’ sensory systems, and attract users’ attention at the visceral level.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Sound evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>For a game, sound is also an important way for players to obtain information and emotions. Try to recall a game you like. Whether it attracts you with exciting battles, beautiful scenes, or touching plots, it is inseparable from the support and enhancement of sound: background music allows players to feel the changes in scenes and environments, skill sound effects allow players to feel the pleasure of battle, and character voices allow players to feel the personality and emotions of the characters. The sound of the game should be consistent with the style and color of the game, and be varied in different scenes or stages, so that the game’s worldview and the user’s perception are seamlessly integrated, reducing the user’s sense of alienation during the experience.</p>
<p>For example, in the fast-paced battle of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players tend to focus on the center of the screen and it is difficult to notice changes in edge UI elements, such as the countdown to skill cooldown. At this time, sound and sound effects can play a very good feedback role: clicking on a skill in cooldown can be informed that your skill is in cooldown through the feedback sound effect of the empty state; when the skill cooldown ends, there is also a corresponding sound effect reminder of skill recovery.</p>
<p>In addition, the various background music in the game, and even the design of UGC instrument composition music, will also bring players a new emotional experience.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fe039528a-3991-4ddf-8a69-1cf3a00c82d8.png/size/"></p>

<p>The gameplay of musical instruments in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> is also diverse, making good use of music to promote interaction and communication between players.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2Fb4588e45-d0c7-4789-90e9-2a4039d02f8b.gif/size/"></p>
<p>Similarly, the “Crystal Prelude” of “Final Fantasy” is one of the most classic melodies in the history of games. The core melody of this prelude has become an important part of almost every “Final Fantasy”. The “Crystal Prelude” adapted by composer Masayoshi Soken for “Final Fantasy XIV” is a brisk melody that makes people look forward to the upcoming fantasy journey; while in “Final Fantasy XVI”, it uses dark music to foreshadow the suffering that Clive will endure, suggesting to players the dark and heavy plot experience on the auditory level.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F2d9b8746-bc10-44da-8aa0-d993a8f09627.jpg/size/"></p>
<p><strong>Touch evokes emotional experience</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, as part of visceral emotional design, touch can help improve the playability and fun of the game, making players more immersed in the game. The control in the game is the most direct way of contact between the player and the game. Through fine control feedback, players can feel the authenticity and tension in the game.</p>
<p>In the expression of touch, the greatest extent of tactile expression we can currently achieve is the delicate multi-level vibration of the game controller. For example, in the racing game <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the controller will simulate the vibration effect of car collisions and impacts, allowing players to feel the danger and tension of the car driving at high speed. In addition, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, some heroes’ ultimate skills, successful parries, the second stage of bow charging, being hit by ground gas, and when the stamina is reduced to a red warning, will also trigger controller vibration.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience"><a href="#Clever-Use-of-Empathy-to-Enter-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience"></a>Clever Use of Empathy to Enter the Experience</h3><p>Enhancing the emotional connection between users and the game world through interaction can bring users a pleasant game experience at the behavioral level, thereby allowing users to further immerse themselves in it. Specifically, the immersive emotional experience at the behavioral level can enable users to more focusedly accept the information transmission in the game, cleverly stimulate users’ unconscious behaviors, and increase the playability of the game. In order to make the game more naturally guide the occurrence of user behavior at the behavioral level and complete the emotional communication between the game and the player, the technique of empathy can be used.</p>
<p>The so-called empathy is to use anthropomorphism, symbolism, metaphor and other methods to design the interface or emotional symbols in the game, give meaning to abstract UI controls, inject emotion into cold virtual graphics, connect the virtual world on the screen with the real world, and build psychological resonance through similar relationships, so that users can quickly adapt to the new context and integrate into the game atmosphere expected by the designer.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<hr>
<p><em>In “All-Star Streetball Party”, the card drawing is packaged as a “supply box”, which is in line with the game’s worldview and helps players understand and use it</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For example, in the retro and avant-garde Internet world constructed in <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, the game designer replaced the hand under the first-person perspective in the game with a thumbs-up gesture or a mouse arrow. By metaphor, the space in the browser is turned into something similar to the physical world, showing the contradiction between the network world and the real world, and bringing players unexpected game experience at the behavioral level with the clever design of interaction.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<h3 id="Clear-Goals-Appropriate-Challenges-and-Immediate-Feedback"><a href="#Clear-Goals-Appropriate-Challenges-and-Immediate-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Clear Goals, Appropriate Challenges, and Immediate Feedback"></a>Clear Goals, Appropriate Challenges, and Immediate Feedback</h3><p>The emotional design of the behavioral layer increases the player’s emotional experience by designing the player’s behavior and interaction, and the conceptual model of the behavioral layer design is inseparable from clear goals, appropriate challenges, and immediate feedback. Will Wright, the designer of “The Sims”, said: “Games can bring people different emotional experiences, which are the pride or guilt that they have never felt when watching movies.” From the perspective of interaction, in game experience design, by combining the above three game design elements, creating attractive experiences with clear strategies and skills can better improve the emotional experience of the game.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> does not have the clear task guidance of traditional RPG games, but players have an extremely immersive game experience. The reason is the clear exploration goals in the game. The game designs a multi-layered map system that is interconnected and independent of each other at the interaction level, so that the map expands the space for vertical exploration and is more exploratory; and, the guidance design that can be seen everywhere in the open world adds a spiral upward light vortex to the shrine, which is convenient for players to easily find even at high places. In the dark underground world, the shimmer of tree roots becomes the only visible beacon, hinting at various resources, landscapes, and enemies in the dark.<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>For games, the difficulty setting of the game itself determines what kind of experience it can bring to players. If it is too simple, it will be boring, and if it is too complicated, it will make people feel anxious. The setting of the game should allow players to be in a challenging range in real time, and the skills required are also constantly improving. In addition to the aforementioned roguelike games and Soulslike games, the emergence of emergent interaction (涌现式交互 - yǒng xiàn shì jiāo hù) also gives the game new fun and challenges, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors, perfectly matching the players’ emotional needs for high freedom and high playability.</p>
<p>The excellent game experience of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> inherits the emergent interaction gene of the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> series, that is, using simple rules to emerge complex dynamic behaviors. For example, in a certain dungeon, there is a chess game that requires the player to kill the black king within three steps. Even if the player does not understand the rules of chess at all, he will find that the black king is weak to electricity and can directly kill the king with electric spells. Like this, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> builds a world with infinite possibilities through the design of the underlying system rules. The integration of emergent interaction also greatly enhances the fun and spread of the game.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F35654386-d173-4bf5-90de-c133a5c1be9c.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>For emotional experience, feedback is a stabilizer and amplifier, stabilizing uneasy emotions and amplifying pleasant feelings. The game system itself is a complex system. Players input their ideas and controls, and through the processing of the game mechanism, they give feedback to the players. Players get the feedback they want and the appropriate degree, and they are more likely to continue to be in pleasure.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231008%2F536adff5-d026-47de-a1f8-5bf0d3a10701.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The teammate feedback mechanism in “Overwatch” extends from a single human-computer interaction feedback to human-to-human interaction feedback.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Emotional design focuses on influencing the user’s emotions and moods from three different levels, enhances the appeal of the design, endows the product with a deeper soul, thereby building a bridge between the user and the product to communicate with the soul, allowing people to obtain unforgettable memories and sublimating the value of design to a higher level.</p>
<p>Games are not only tools for entertainment and recreation, they also have the potential to evoke emotions and touch hearts, and through visceral sensory effects, empathy, game interaction mechanisms and storylines, etc., to trigger players’ emotional resonance and create a rich game experience. We have also made a more in-depth dismantling of the relationship between games and emotional design. With the continuous development of the game industry, emotional design will continue to play an important role in game experience, creating unforgettable emotional experiences for players.</p>

    <title>Layered and Engaging Visual Hierarchy Design in 3D Lobbies</title>
    <url>/2023/10/08/netease-ux-articles/news_20231030_28584_1117528/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231030/28584_1117528.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The game lobby serves as a transportation hub in the game, mainly responsible for guiding players to different sub-functions and sub-systems (such as tasks, activities, social interactions, etc.) other than the core gameplay. In addition to the above tasks, it also includes displaying other information (such as various prompts), carrying some of the players’ social needs, and other additional functions. Therefore, the current display-type lobby format can no longer meet the needs of players in the lobby. The 3D interactive lobby format came into being. Players can familiarize themselves with and understand the game’s worldview, basic operations, and many other functions in the game in advance in this lobby space.</p>
<p>However, the visual hierarchy in a three-dimensional space is more complex than in a two-dimensional space. So, as game designers, how can we do a good job in the visual hierarchy design of information in the 3D lobby, provide players with a lobby experience that combines immersion and practicality, and achieve the “engaging” design effect? This article will start with the classification of game lobbies, and then introduce from the inside out from three aspects: “reasonable display of information according to priority”, “reasonable display or hiding of information”, and “visual packaging combined with worldview”.</p>
<h2 id="1-Classification-of-Game-Lobbies"><a href="#1-Classification-of-Game-Lobbies" class="headerlink" title="1. Classification of Game Lobbies"></a>1. Classification of Game Lobbies</h2><p>Currently, the more common game lobby design directions can be roughly divided into two types: display type and exploration type, and each type can be further subdivided into 2D and 3D according to the dimensions of the space. The fundamental difference between display and exploration types is whether the character controlled by the player can move freely in the scene. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F900f5d07-cad1-4d29-ae2c-d2370b506519.png/size/"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2D-Display Type:</strong> A more general lobby type, commonly found in various mobile games. The design of the visual hierarchy of the interface also adopts a straightforward approach. The main purpose is to display functional entrances as much as possible in a limited space, and to facilitate players to enter various functions;</li>
<li><strong>3D-Display Type:</strong> Mainly displays character and scene models. The character models and scenes in this type of lobby choose the 3D form, which can show more model details, but the characters cannot be moved by the player in the space;</li>
<li><strong>2D-Exploration Type:</strong> Players can freely move on the horizontal axis, which is more similar to a horizontal scroll. In this type of lobby, more functional entrances are also bound to items in the scene;</li>
<li><strong>3D-Exploration Type:</strong> Compared with 2D scenes, 3D exploration type lobbies add depth. Players can control characters to walk freely in the space. In addition to binding functions to items in the scene, they can even meet other players in the scene, allowing players to have more physicalized communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Underlying-Foundation-Reasonable-Display-of-Information-According-to-Priority"><a href="#2-Underlying-Foundation-Reasonable-Display-of-Information-According-to-Priority" class="headerlink" title="2. Underlying Foundation: Reasonable Display of Information According to Priority"></a>2. Underlying Foundation: Reasonable Display of Information According to Priority</h2><p>The types of information carried in the game lobby are very diverse, including clickable buttons, functional entrance panels, and some instant information, such as messages from strangers and system tips. This information is very important to players, but displaying it without distinguishing priority will reduce the player’s experience and immersion, affecting information acquisition. Therefore, dividing the priority of information is also to more freely reduce the interference of some information and enhance the player’s sense of substitution in the game world.</p>
<h3 id="Important-Information-is-Always-Displayed-on-Top"><a href="#Important-Information-is-Always-Displayed-on-Top" class="headerlink" title="Important Information is Always Displayed on Top"></a>Important Information is Always Displayed on Top</h3><p>In the space of the 3D lobby, players will be attracted by various elements in the scene, and at the same time, there will be various system information that needs to be queued to inform the user. However, some highest priority information needs to be fed back to the player in time, such as the current status and location. In conventional design, the effect of such information will be enhanced, but doing so may directly conflict with the goal of “immersion”. Therefore, for this part of the information, it is necessary to display it on top in a fixed position in the space to cultivate the player’s habits.</p>
<p>According to the characteristics of this type of information, in most 3D lobby designs, they will be placed in the four corners of the screen, including 2 reasons:</p>
<p>(1). Information residing in the corners does not affect players’ exploration and substitution of space;<br>(2). For information in the corner, players can quickly locate it, and the line of sight or interactive tools (mouse) do not need to be specifically searched to move to the information area. This design is also in line with “Fitts’s Law”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F3f7ef8d0-b136-4ae4-92ca-d7f4df204548.png/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Give-Players-Necessary-Help-Information"><a href="#Give-Players-Necessary-Help-Information" class="headerlink" title="Give Players Necessary Help Information"></a>Give Players Necessary Help Information</h3><p>In the game, the role of the lobby function is more like a product. Therefore, when designing the information hierarchy of the 3D lobby, you can learn from some product interaction concepts, such as Nielsen’s ten usability principles of “Help and documentation”.</p>
<p>The Help and documentation principle means that it is best if the system allows users to use it without reading the documentation, but help documentation is usually still needed. Any information should be easy to search, focus on the user’s tasks, and list specific steps to inform the user.</p>
<p>In the 3D lobby space scene, players may be confused about how and where to open some functions. Therefore, some games use the form of resident HUD to help players understand the shortcut keys of some operations. For example, the 3D lobby mode of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> - Penglai Island provides shortcut key prompts for various shortcut operations.</p>
<p>The information of this nature is to help players better integrate into the operation of the game, so it will also be at the top of the information hierarchy, and the positioning in the plane will also refer to the location of important information, that is, at the edge of the screen and does not affect the player’s experience of the scene. </p>

Therefore, in the presentation of information, it is still necessary to maintain a certain degree of fun to stimulate players’ interest in exploring the 3D space. In the process of exploration, it can also increase players’ understanding of the worldview and game background, and discover the small easter eggs buried by the designers. However, when choosing this information, it is necessary to pay attention to that they will not affect the player’s main operations and main process, so as to avoid negative impact on the main process. </p>

Middle Layer Control: Reasonable “Display” or “Hiding” of Information</h2><p>Players move constantly in the 3D lobby, which causes their spatial position to change. For example, when a player is attracted to an item or scene, they will move. Therefore, the prompt information in the scene is also constantly moving relative to the character. In addition, as the distance increases, the information in the space will gradually disappear. Therefore, while considering the information hierarchy, it is also necessary to comprehensively consider the player’s wishes and the impact on immersion.</p>
<h3 id="Give-Players-the-Right-to-Choose"><a href="#Give-Players-the-Right-to-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Give Players the Right to Choose"></a>Give Players the Right to Choose</h3><p>When players are exposed to the new lobby design form of the 3D lobby, they naturally also hope to be able to explore the entire scene and its details. When they can generate the feeling that they have replaced the characters in it, they have largely mastered some basic game operations. At this time, some HUD information in the scene is not suitable for display. If players can choose to display or hide independently, it will be able to greatly enhance the player’s “environmental immersion”. This is also very much in line with the “User control and freedom” principle of the ten usability principles.</p>
<p>In <em>The Division 2</em>, players can turn off the HUD display in the settings to enhance the immersive experience of the game. </p>

The purpose is also to allow players to better invest in the game’s worldview and plot. This purpose coincides with the 3D lobby. The linear design style can better weaken the distraction of UI on players’ attention during the experience. In some designs, it will be used: when the player approaches, it will display and prompt the specific function, and when the player is still a certain distance away, it will only provide instructions to indicate that “there is a function that can be operated in this area”.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>The Division 2</em>, when the player approaches, the interface will prompt the function of the area and click to open the operation panel. In <em>Star Citizen</em>, the operation of the function is bound to the items in the scene. When the player is far away, only the prompt is seen, and when approaching, the specific function can be opened. </p>

<p>As for the scale of weakening information and how close the player is to pop up the prompt of the function, it depends on the game designer’s choice of scene and the map size of the 3D lobby. When the picture is at a wide angle, indicative information can be displayed when the player moves continuously for 3 units; when the picture is at close range, too much information will affect the player’s experience. However, these considerations also need to be determined according to the actual situation of the game.</p>

For these functions, it is more hoped that players can go to understand, and then promote players’ understanding of the game’s worldview and background. For example, in the decryption information in the lobby of <em>Identity V</em>, the visual intensity will be stronger than the light on the wall, which is also hoped to attract players’ attention in this way, and explore and discover secrets in this castle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fd61a2143-815b-4629-83c0-bdc22a6a0410.png/size/"></p>

<p>The “Cloud Top Racing” gameplay in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> Penglai Island is similar.

The designer strengthened the entrance of the game by marking the wooden sign of the “Cloud Top Racing” gameplay, and attracted the attention of players. </p>

Top-level Presentation: Visual Packaging Combined with Worldview"></a>4. Top-level Presentation: Visual Packaging Combined with Worldview</h2><p>A very important part of visual hierarchy design is how to make information appear in the player’s field of vision without being obtrusive, which requires better integration with the worldview. The most common example is that science fiction games usually have a helmet or monitor for the player’s character, and some information can be displayed on the player’s screen through the form of HUD, which can also bring a stronger sense of immersion.</p>
<h3 id="Display-Information-Based-on-Game-Background"><a href="#Display-Information-Based-on-Game-Background" class="headerlink" title="Display Information Based on Game Background"></a>Display Information Based on Game Background</h3><p>As visual animals, humans are easily affected by what their eyes see. When experiencing the game, the first thing we come into contact with is the visual design of the “game lobby”. If this design can be closely integrated with the game’s worldview, it can bring players a better environmental sensory experience.</p>
<p>And the creation of the environment is not only the work of art designers and scene designers, but as interaction designers, they also need to better integrate information with the scene, and need to distinguish between functional entrances and ordinary embellishment entrances; at the same time, they can allow players to view some important information at any time, avoiding being immersed in the environment and losing curiosity about the core gameplay. For example, in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, designers display the displayed information through graffiti, and make a short stay for the information of other players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc064b948-f66d-4a8a-b6cf-7a0c23af5eab.png/size/"></p>

Designers can consider doing more scenario design in this scene. While ensuring the display of basic information, designers had better leave more space for the display of environment and scenes, and will change the background according to the changes of marketing activities. On this basis, some information can be placed in the scene, such as the name of the place, instructions for secondary operations, and so on. The purpose of doing so is also to help players in the process of exploring the lobby, gradually generate the idea of “I am the character”.</p>
<p>For example, the entrance to the battle in <em>Splatoon 3</em> is placed in a building, and players can enter the battle mode selection by entering the building; also in this game, the newly launched function “locker”, players can customize their own lockers in a personalized way, and have more communication and interaction with other players. </p>

<h2 id="5-Conclusion"><a href="#5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="5. Conclusion"></a>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Today, the design of 3D lobbies is becoming more and more abundant. Designers have added more new gameplay to the scene and space to ensure that players will not feel bored and uninteresting in the lobby. These innovations and optimizations aim to make players more immersive in the game world while gaining more fun. At the same time, the information in the scene is also becoming more and more, and the information density is also getting higher and higher. Therefore, designers need to carefully and rigorously design the visual hierarchy of information to enhance the player’s sense of substitution, environmental sensory experience and immersion in the game.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20231030/28584_1117531.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-Context"><a href="#1-Context" class="headerlink" title="1. Context"></a>1. Context</h2><h3 id="What-is-context"><a href="#What-is-context" class="headerlink" title="What is context?"></a>What is context?</h3><p>Context refers to the environment when using language. Context can usually be divided into two types: narrow and broad. Narrowly defined, it refers to the linguistic environment formed by the context of written language or the preceding and following words of spoken language; broadly defined, it refers to the specific environment of language expression (which can refer to specific occasions or social environment).</p>
<p>In addition to the objective environment, context is also related to the background knowledge in the minds of each user and expresser.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-recontextualization"><a href="#What-is-recontextualization" class="headerlink" title="What is recontextualization?"></a>What is recontextualization?</h3><p>“Recontextualization” is a sociolinguistic concept summarized by Per Linell, which refers to extracting a piece of discourse from its original context and placing it in a new context, and this new context may change the meaning and understanding of the discourse. This method is often used in various media and contexts such as news reports, political discourse, and advertising. In the words of the German poet Novalis, the role of recontextualization is to “make the familiar strange and the strange familiar”.</p>
<p>For example, “killing the chicken to get the eggs” originally meant to literally kill the chicken in order to get the eggs; it is a metaphor for coveting immediate benefits without considering long-term interests. In “Let the Bullets Fly”, the “killing the chicken to get the eggs” in Master Huang’s context refers to getting rid of Zhang Mazi and taking back the diamonds.</p>
<p>For another example, the “original display” we see when visiting a museum is a “recontextualization” of the excavated&#x2F;preserved cultural relics: giving new value to the cultural relics in a new time and space. Visitors re-experience the era background of the cultural relics and their possible functions and meanings through the museum’s layout and curation. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Context"><a href="#Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Design Context"></a>Design Context</h3><p>The design context refers to the environment, background, and cultural factors of the design work, as well as the interaction between the design work and the surrounding environment, users, and society. The design context determines the actual effect and meaning of the design work.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly used household chopstick holder is designed with many openings for ventilation to prevent the chopsticks from being closed, damp, and deteriorating. This design in the outdoor context allows it to be used as a firewood stove. The porous structure cleverly ensures sufficient oxygen conditions for starting a fire. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc3f38481-4b60-420e-88d3-6466e44d109b.gif/size/"></p>

<h3 id="Game-Experience-Design-Context"><a href="#Game-Experience-Design-Context" class="headerlink" title="Game Experience Design Context"></a>Game Experience Design Context</h3><p>The game’s worldview is a complex that encompasses architecture, space, scenes, art style, economy, system, and social customs. It encompasses the physical environment, cultural environment, and social environment in the design context, affecting the visual effects, cultural meanings, and values of the design content.</p>
<p>The interaction between the game and the player means that the game and the player are symbionts under the same worldview. Factors such as the player’s game goals and needs, usage habits, operating behaviors, and psychological state during use are as important as the worldview in affecting the use effect and user satisfaction of the design content. For example, in “Minecraft”, the large amount of real-world UGC content created by players continues to inject new vitality into the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F309d8dfb-9f23-4c82-a6f1-db3de71aa1f2.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<p>Therefore, in game experience design, considering the context is very important, it can help developers better understand the usage scenarios and needs of functions, so as to better meet user needs and improve player satisfaction. At the same time, considering the context can also help developers create design works with more cultural connotations and social value, and improve the artistry and innovation of design works.</p>
<h2 id="2-Recontextualization-in-Games"><a href="#2-Recontextualization-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Recontextualization in Games"></a>2. Recontextualization in Games</h2><p>Recontextualization in games refers to the game introducing new mechanisms or informing new information, so that players can (voluntarily) experience existing content in a new way, that is, a way to revitalize existing content. Common application methods in games include the following two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing familiar environments and content by using new mechanisms or props.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Recontextualization:</strong> Refers to the process of players experiencing existing content from different angles&#x2F;paths through the transfer of prior knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent example of recontextualization in game design is <em>Hitman 2</em>, where developers, through the design of “identity roles” and their “scope of activities” and “mission objectives”, allow players to have multiple “recontextualization” experiences, and even bring a “lingering” game experience.</p>
<p>In this game, players can eliminate NPCs of different class identities and clothing to disguise themselves as characters with different identity permissions, and then enter different areas of the map with different open levels. The single game map and the number of NPCs are fixed. In order to complete various challenges on the same map, players need to repeatedly explore and replay between different roles and areas using existing knowledge to achieve all challenge goals. At the same time, with the different identity roles of the player, the tasks that the current role needs to complete, the dangers in the scene, and the boundary prompts will also change. </p>

How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design"></a>3. How to Use Recontextualization to Do a Good Job in Game Experience Design</h2><p>From a macro perspective, the game itself is a way to “recontextualize” the content it carries. Overall, there is only one core idea: “As long as I want to do it and I can do it, then I can do it”. But how to let players achieve this excellent experience of “thinking what I think, doing what I can” in experience design?</p>
<p>In the following content, we combine the experience design of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>‘s Penglai Island Cloud Top Race to further explain how to use the design idea of recontextualization in the game:</p>
<p>Penglai Island is a three-dimensional social environment launched by <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> in its 2nd anniversary version, and Cloud Top Race is a section of architectural and stone ruins located in the southern part of Silver阙 Garden. Players can enter this area from the south of Silver阙 Garden. When players pass through this area within 360 seconds and reach the race finish line on the west side of Secret Source Island, they can get certain race rewards. </p>

If possible, without interfering with other content and enriching the function, multiple entry or exit experience paths can be set for the same content to meet most of the possibilities of player exploration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F64b490a4-b51c-49de-8210-34e216bf5ebe.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>Cloud Top Race game rules</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When designing the Cloud Top Race function of Penglai Island, it was not stipulated how players would reach the finish line, or what tools they would use. Only the most commonly used fast displacement prop in the game, [Grappling Hook], was triggered to increase the time. This can be regarded as a method reminder for reaching the finish line. In the actual experience process, players can follow the game’s teaching of jumping, grappling hook, wall strike, or even various combinations to reach the finish line in the fastest way, and they are all allowed.</p>
<h3 id="Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality"><a href="#Find-Experience-Mappings-in-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Find Experience Mappings in Reality"></a>Find Experience Mappings in Reality</h3><p>In addition to simulating various behaviors that players may have, it is also necessary to further consider the source of gameplay and functions. Whether there are similar experience contents in reality. Sort out the experience processes of the two and correspond them one by one, reduce the keyboard and mouse interaction links in the design, and make the entire experience process more natural.</p>
<p>When designing the interaction between the start and finish lines of Cloud Top Race, the design team did not use the common general mechanism interaction in the game (ie, press [E]), but made a regional interaction behavior trigger logic, which can be very clearly found on it analogous to the experience process of most sports competitions in reality: players can start racing from entering the game area, start timing after crossing the “start line”, and stop timing and get rewards when reaching the finish line “crossing the line”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2F4147d0e3-3027-4222-a983-40fb3bee9903.png/size/"></p>

That is, on the premise of ensuring the fairness of the game content, adjust the low emotional feedback nodes in the real experience, avoid excessive frustration, and keep the player’s emotions on the basic emotional baseline of the game during the experience.</p>
<p>In the race, the player’s use of the grappling hook prop itself can be regarded as a way to quickly move and reduce the fair racing experience, but the designer did not impose an “irreversible penalty” on the player, such as canceling the result in sports competitions, but used the analogy between movement distance and grappling hook, and used increasing timing to complete the basic punishment method for the player. Moreover, in many players’ racing processes, using the grappling hook when accidentally making a mistake in the middle of the race can also be used as an effective strategy to “avoid restarting”. Many skilled players can complete the entire race within 50 seconds even with a single use of the grappling hook. </p>

<p>At the same time, in order to avoid the player’s emotional depression during the race, the target point prompt will be refreshed in time within a certain range during the race to help the player find the official racing track direction and avoid the player’s emotional low tide caused by direction loss; basic reward props are set for players with different racing durations to ensure the basic acquisition experience of players. </p>

<p>After familiarizing yourself with “recontextualization” and this design idea, we can see that in addition to the large gameplay that can perfectly fit its design process, many small design details in the game also hide the ingenuity of “recontextualization”. For example, in the <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> maps of Griffin’s Nest and Fire Nation, a large number of small animals that conform to the characteristics of the scene and season can obtain prop rewards after being killed, and shooting down the Spring Festival targets flying in the air will also drop different rewards. </p>

<h3 id="Design-Considerations"><a href="#Design-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Design Considerations"></a>Design Considerations</h3><p>The application of “recontextualization” in experience design can be regarded as a design method that can move the game four or two: it can expand the scope and possibilities of the game to infinity through limited content. However, due to the limitations of recontextualization design, this effect will only have a significant positive feedback effect in “non-linear” or “multi-map” games (that is, players do not need to complete the single-process game content according to a single timeline), such as the association design of A-side and B-side in Celeste, allowing players to enter the original level multiple times to experience new content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fc5ed75e1-ac6f-47cf-bd7a-97e9278ecb69.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Celeste》 The player accidentally learned the charged super jump in the A-side content</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At the same time, these “recontextualized” contents basically use more complex scene design and level connections in order to “create enough possibilities”, and often require more cost and time to develop. Some content details may not be discovered by players until the game disappears from the market.</p>
<p>As <em>The Stanley Parable</em> developer Pugh said, “The production of these contents is like shouting at the void. It may take two years before you can hear the echo from the other end of the void, because someone finally heard your silent shout from the cacophony.” However, it is precisely because these game designers continue to scrutinize and sculpt works of art that we can glimpse their state of mind at that time across time and space during the experience, and complete a spiritual adventure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20231030%2Fb220b88e-ba5d-4c06-a354-2c8fdbdd38a6.gif/size/"></p>

<h2 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h2><p>When we were children, we ran around downstairs at home, which constituted our first impression of the outside road. But when you learn to ride a bicycle, skateboard, or even drive, roads of different materials and widths have unique meanings in your eyes. From the first time you play games with a keyboard and mouse to later contacting different platforms and devices, the same game also produces new experiences in your eyes.</p>
<p>The powerful positive feedback brought by recontextualization design is essentially based on the player’s desire for learning and exploration and discovery, and the source of its happiness is the player’s original intention of being curious about the world. Please stay curious and continue to explore this world. Perhaps behind many of the contents you find with surprise, there is a carnival in the heart of a designer.</p>

    <title>Games Have Backups Too - Why Do We Need Secondary Games</title>
    <url>/2023/12/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20240105_28584_1130221/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240105/28584_1130221.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games"><a href="#1-What-are-Main-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?"></a>1. What are Main&#x2F;Secondary Games?</h2><p>The concept of “main game, secondary game” has been around for quite some time, mainly because the content design of some games on the market greatly reduces the burden on players, allowing them to experience the game content flexibly, saving them worry and effort.</p>
<p>In this way, players who like to watch live broadcasts will also find that many game streamers open some casual games (such as <em>Dou Dizhu</em>) while waiting for matchmaking. On the one hand, the matchmaking waiting time is indeed too long, and they can’t just wait. On the other hand, it can also add some effect to the live broadcast and interact with fans. This is not a phenomenon unique to live broadcast rooms. Many players will also play a round of <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> while resting after playing <em>DOTA</em>.</p>
<p>Many players will play multiple games at the same time, and the concept of “main game” and “secondary game” has gradually become popular. Sometimes it’s even “a solid secondary game, a flowing main game”. Main games and secondary games may not be specifically distinguished at the beginning, but are divided according to the time and energy invested. For example, in <em>Justice Online Mobile</em>, the game is large and there is a lot of content to explore; and as the player’s level increases and gradually unlocks guilds, homes, etc., a sense of belonging will gradually develop. Over time, while playing other games, they will also subconsciously set aside a certain amount of time for this game; while in comparison, secondary games focus more on the immediate feeling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240105%2Fe996d236-94a1-403b-98ca-4d581970a80e.gif/size/"></p>
<p>So, are all “lightweight games” “secondary games”?</p>
<p>Obviously not. The so-called main and secondary games have nothing to do with the game category itself, but are a relative concept. For each player, they can have their own “main game” and “secondary game”. Generally speaking, secondary games often have the following relative characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less time spent:</strong> On average, players spend less time and energy in this game than in other main games they play.</li>
<li><strong>Less economic expenditure:</strong> For most players, the investment of money is often proportional to the love of the game. This is also true for buyout games. Players are willing to pay for better-made games, and they are also willing to collect different versions of games for their feelings, even if this requires repeated expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Less emotional investment:</strong> Players of many games will spontaneously become “volunteers” for their favorite games, giving good reviews, promoting, and vigorously promoting the game. Those who are capable will also “generate electricity with love” and create more derivative products related to the game. However, players generally do not invest in this level of effort for secondary games.</li>
<li><strong>More single game goal:</strong> Secondary games often only meet a part of the player’s most core game experience needs, rather than meeting multiple needs at once.</li>
<li><strong>Weaker social connections:</strong> Except for some secondary games that are only experienced for social reasons, most players invest less time, energy, and emotion in experiencing secondary games, and hardly establish complex social relationships outside of experiencing the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games"><a href="#2-Why-Do-Players-Play-Secondary-Games" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?"></a>2. Why Do Players Play Secondary Games?</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous section, secondary games often meet a certain part of the player’s game experience needs. Conversely, games that can simultaneously meet multiple core game experiences of players are more likely to become the main games that players invest in for a long time. This is also the fundamental reason why many games continue to expand gameplay, polish game content, and improve game experience: to attract and retain more players.</p>
<p>In the realm of philosophy, it is mentioned that in the process of things developing, the principal contradiction is in a dominant position, regulating or influencing other contradictions. As for game selection, when players find that one of their needs can be better matched with a certain game, they may choose to experience a secondary game.</p>
<p>For example, after a player experiences an extremely intense ranked match, “rest and relaxation” becomes their most urgent need; when waiting in line and not knowing when they will be called, what the player needs is a game that “starts and plays immediately, and will not be penalized for quitting”; on a train shuttling between mountains, “not afraid of lag” is the player’s most basic appeal; at a multiplayer offline party, friends enthusiastically invite, even if they don’t like this type of game, they will be willing to play with friends… At different times, players choose secondary games with different standards, but they are all closely related to the current needs. When these restrictions are no longer present, players will still return to their main game, because they have invested more energy here and can get more of the game experience they need.</p>
<p>This also causes the player’s main and secondary games to change or even switch over time. Students have more entertainment time and can spend more time completing daily tasks, “replacing krypton with liver”; and after entering the working state, time becomes precious, and they need to “spend money to buy time”.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More"><a href="#3-How-to-Make-Players-Love-Playing-Secondary-Games-More" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?"></a>3. How to Make Players Love Playing Secondary Games More?</h2><p>The market for secondary games is pioneering. Everyone’s time and energy are limited, and it is unrealistic to try to make players experience multiple main games at the same time. Although secondary games mean that players invest less, but many small amounts add up. Many games have gained a good reputation for their excellent quality and precise user insights. For example, <em>Tabi Kaeru (Travel Frog)</em>, launched in 2017, made many players keen to “raise a frog son”, and ranked first on the App Store China free game list without an official Chinese version. In many cases, the competitors of secondary games are not only other games, but also all things that will attract users’ attention. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240105%2Fc67f4b54-4202-45b4-9b5e-4426b067f2bb.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>How to make players more willing to experience a secondary game? We can learn a thing or two from the design of many hyper-casual games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to learn, simple to operate:</strong> A low game entry threshold can help the game be accessed and mastered by a wider range of players. Common gameplays of hyper-casual games such as puzzles, synthesis, stacking, racing, etc., players can almost learn at a glance and master the core gameplay in a short time. The operating frequency in the game is not high, the requirements for the player’s instantaneous response are low, or automatic pathfinding, automatic combat, and other methods are used;</li>
<li><strong>Small levels, short process:</strong> During the game process, players are not required to have high concentration and do not need to keep staring at the screen. Make full use of fragmented time, players can open the game anytime, anywhere, and there is no strict end time point, and the experience of entering and leaving is relatively smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Simple numerical design:</strong> The in-game cycle is relatively direct, and the acquisition and consumption paths of currency&#x2F;props are clear. However, simple values do not necessarily mean that the game has no depth and is abandoned after 1 hour. Through algorithms, many games can automatically generate hundreds of levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are some experiences that can provide inspiration for our design of secondary games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance to the main game:</strong> <em>Dota Auto Chess</em> uses the worldview, races, heroes, skills, and equipment system settings of <em>DOTA</em>, so that DOTA players can naturally get started with the game quickly and are more willing to stay in it, which plays a good supplementary role with some players’ main game <em>DOTA</em>;</li>
<li><strong>Reduced burden of daily tasks:</strong> There is no need for complicated login and task systems to tie up players’ time. Players can take some time to experience the game content for a period of time at one time, and it is not mandatory to go online every day or every hour;</li>
<li><strong>More compensation rewards, less penalty mechanisms:</strong> Even if the player is not online, they can still get growth in the game, such as offline rewards, experience compensation, etc.; and even if the player quits halfway, there will be no direct punishment, and there is no psychological burden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Summary"><a href="#4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Summary"></a>4. Summary</h2><p>Lowering the quality because it is positioned as a secondary game? This is not acceptable to players and the market, and becoming a “secondary game” is not an excuse for game manufacturers to slack off. Letting players “meet major needs with low investment” is the standard of a successful secondary game, even if the player only stays in this game for a few hours, has watched the plot once and cleared the level, or has experienced the first 30 levels. I hope that when players look back and think of this game, they will praise it: “At that time, it was very interesting”.</p>

    <title>Free if You Don&#39;t Buy: Analyzing Popular Games that Went Free-to-Play</title>
    <url>/2024/01/15/netease-ux-articles/news_20240116_28584_1132308/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240116/28584_1132308.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<h2 id="1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models"><a href="#1-Mainstream-Game-Payment-Models" class="headerlink" title="1. Mainstream Game Payment Models"></a>1. Mainstream Game Payment Models</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “Buy early, enjoy early; buy late, enjoy discounts; don’t buy, get it for free.” After a game’s initial priced release, there’s usually a relatively long period of price stability, which is the main source of revenue for new games in their early stages. After a period of stable operation, there might be limited-time discounts at certain points, such as during Steam sales, to attract hesitant players.</p>
<p>And for some games, the final stage is to completely remove the payment barrier after a long period of operation and switch to free-to-play. <em>PUBG</em>, released in 2017 with an initial price of $29.99 (98 yuan in China), became a free-to-play game in January 2022. <em>Fall Guys</em>, released in August 2020 with an initial price of $19.99 (58 yuan in China), became free-to-play in June 2022. <em>Overwatch</em> went free-to-play when its sequel, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, was released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F74c69f71-14dc-4e51-a38e-dfdd95bb18b3.jpg/size/"></p>
<p>In summary, whether in China or abroad, there are mainly three payment models for online games: The first is buy-to-play, where you pay to purchase the experience qualification and obtain permanent access to the game after payment; examples include <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>New World</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p>
<p>The second is free-to-play, where there is no barrier to entry, replaced mainly by in-game store purchases. Examples include <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<p>The third is a time-based subscription model, where players purchase points to exchange for game time, paying for how much they play. Examples include <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Fantasy Westward Journey</em>. This payment model will not be discussed in this article.</p>
<p>So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these different payment models? Why do some developers choose to switch from paid to free, and what issues do game companies need to face when making this decision?</p>
<h3 id="Buy-to-Play-Games"><a href="#Buy-to-Play-Games" class="headerlink" title="Buy-to-Play Games"></a>Buy-to-Play Games</h3><p>For buy-to-play games, the main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game quality is usually relatively higher:</strong> Generally speaking, with similar investment budgets, the quality of buy-to-play games is relatively higher than that of free games. They need to attract players to overcome the payment barrier and try the game with quality. If the manufacturer does not have excellent graphics and core gameplay, it will be difficult to obtain sufficient revenue and reputation from selling the game. Compared with free games that profit from in-game stores, buy-to-play games save a lot of development and design resources on payment and long-term content. Therefore, they have enough manpower and resources to invest in game quality, concentrate on targeted design, and provide players with a better gaming experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Has a certain threshold, fewer cheaters:</strong> For players who use illegal software, they need to pay for the game again for each account they change. Increasing the cost of cheating for players by buying out also has a certain inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cheating to a certain extent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, sometimes the threshold limit is also one of its shortcomings. The mode of paying to purchase an admission ticket will also prevent some players from entering the game, especially since most AAA games are not cheap at the time of their initial release, which will become a factor hindering players from purchasing the game for players with different consumption levels.</p>
<h3 id="Free-Games"><a href="#Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="Free Games"></a>Free Games</h3><p>For free games, the biggest advantage is that there is no threshold. As long as the device can handle it, anyone can enter the game and experience it. Although everyone has different game preferences, and many players will find that they are not the target audience and lose interest in the game after trying it out, due to the large base of new players, the number of players who finally stay in the game may be more than that of some buy-to-play games.</p>
<p>Why do companies like Bluehole, Valve, and Activision Blizzard choose to make originally paid games free? From the data point of view, when making such a decision, the game is likely to have gone downhill for a while, and the number of retained players continues to decrease. Switching to free-to-play is also largely to attract more players who are kept out by the payment barrier. <em>PUBG</em>, a once-phenomenal game, has seen its DAU continue to decline since it reached its online peak in 2018 due to various reasons. By the end of 2021, the average number of online players in the game had fallen below 150,000, and the peak online was only about one-tenth of the peak. After announcing the switch to free-to-play, many free players poured in, the peak number of online players in the game almost doubled, and the average number of online players also increased significantly. <em>Fall Guys</em>, also a game that requires a high number of concurrent players, had very strong data in the early days of its launch, but as its popularity gradually declined, its developers were also considering how to extend the life of the game. After its decision to switch to free-to-play, the total number of players worldwide quickly exceeded 20 million, and exceeded 50 million within 2 weeks, further achieving a large-scale breakthrough in the user base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F1178cc1e-4db0-4bb3-83ae-53407235ef44.png/size/"></p>

<p><em>PUBG experienced a peak online of more than 3.2 million in 2018, and the number of players continued to decline.</em></p>

<h2 id="2-What-Issues-Should-Be-Paid-Attention-to-When-a-Game-Goes-Free-to-Play"><a href="#2-What-Issues-Should-Be-Paid-Attention-to-When-a-Game-Goes-Free-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="2. What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?"></a>2. What Issues Should Be Paid Attention to When a Game Goes Free-to-Play?</h2><p>Although the effect is good, going free-to-play is not a tool that a game can casually use to attract players. If the following problems are not properly handled, it may have the opposite effect.</p>
<h3 id="Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place"><a href="#Compensation-for-Veteran-Players-Needs-to-Be-in-Place" class="headerlink" title="Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place"></a>Compensation for Veteran Players Needs to Be in Place</h3><p>Players who purchased the game before it went free-to-play are people who spent real money to buy the game and experience it. For developers, this part of the players needs more attention and maintenance. Game manufacturers cannot only focus on attracting new players and not do their best to retain existing veteran players. If the compensation given by the manufacturer to veteran players is sincere and attractive enough, it will also attract a large number of veteran players to return; if the compensation is stingy, veteran players will not only not buy it, but may also give the game a bad review because they feel betrayed, ruining the reputation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F412e1adb-2fb1-49b1-ba99-a54384d27d89.png/size/"></p>
<p>In this regard, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> directly returned the money spent by veteran players to purchase the game in equal proportion as in-game currency when it went free-to-play, so that everyone said “misunderstanding resolved” after learning about the compensation benefits, and called it a great deal; there were even many new players who directly purchased the game at the original price after seeing the news, and then waited for the refund of gold ingots. On the day of the free-to-play launch, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> sold another 1 million copies, once again climbing to the second place on the Steam sales list, and even the official website was overloaded by enthusiastic players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240116%2F0056ed33-b932-4a11-aad9-ec698ce79f68.png/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Live broadcast of Naraka: Bladepoint announcing free-to-play (left) and announcing compensation rewards for veteran players (right)</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Anti-Cheat-Work"><a href="#Anti-Cheat-Work" class="headerlink" title="Anti-Cheat Work"></a>Anti-Cheat Work</h3><p>When a game becomes free, it means that there is no payment barrier for anyone to enter the game, and the soil of low account cost is particularly prone to breeding cheating and forming a proliferation. In a fair competitive environment, it is devastating to the game experience of normal players. When criminals can cheat at almost no cost, the gaming experience of normal players will be greatly affected. Especially for tactical competitive games, one cheating player will affect nearly 60 or even 100 normal players in the same game. One-shot headshots and ignoring control make the game experience very bad.</p>
<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>PUBG</em> has been criticized by players for cheating. After going free-to-play, it did not make effective restrictions on cheating. It only launched casual mode and competitive mode to separate paid players and free players when it switched to free. However, not all players are keen on competitive mode. In a mode where cheating is rampant and cannot be banned for a long time, any type of player will have a hard time having a good gaming experience.</p>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>, which also became a free-to-play game in 2022, has also been plagued by cheating, and is jokingly called “Fairy Bean Man” by players. The gameplay of <em>Fall Guys</em> is a casual level-breaking type, and the number of players in a single game is also large. One person cheating can make all players in this game restart directly. </p>

<p>Before going free-to-play, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> also realized that once the game is open for free play, a large number of players will flood in, including criminals who intend to cheat. To this end, the development team made preparations in advance and banned 2,754 players who used cheats on the day of the free-to-play launch; at the same time, they also deducted the rank points of 163 players who “rode the cheat car” to warn all new and old players not to try to benefit from cheating, and to maintain a fair game environment in a timely manner.</p>
<h3 id="New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues"><a href="#New-Player’s-Novice-Period-Experience-Issues" class="headerlink" title="New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues"></a>New Player’s Novice Period Experience Issues</h3><p>For new players, getting started with an old game that has been in operation for a period of time has a high cost. Veteran players have gone through a lot of training and have mastered many game skills, but new players don’t know anything when they enter the game, which can easily bring them some uncontrollable frustration. After the game goes free-to-play, on the one hand, the game needs to optimize the novice guide, teaching and other onboarding issues to lead new players to quickly master the game. Especially for some new players who have not necessarily been familiar with action games before, this group of non-core players and general players especially need strong novice guidance to teach and retain them. On the other hand, the game also needs to make more optimizations in the matching mechanism, reasonably allocate the rank difference of players in the game, and prevent the “smurfing” behavior of veteran players from leading to the direct churn of new players.</p>
<p>Novice guidance has always been a very important module of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>. When it went free-to-play, the game deliberately added a lot of special training in the practice mode, including basic parry practice, charged attack followed by parry practice, jump parry practice, and higher-level operations such as dodge parry and grapple parry. Many of these operations require players to accumulate a certain amount of game time and number of games, and they can only be mastered skillfully after learning in actual combat. Putting them in the practice mode can facilitate players who are not familiar with action operations to carry out more practical exercises, accelerate the learning efficiency, and experience the joy of parrying faster. </p>

<h2 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h2><p>Going free-to-play is not a panacea for a game to revive when its popularity declines. If the decision to go free-to-play and the compensation plan are not fully considered, it may backfire and accelerate the decline of the game. Going free-to-play needs to carefully consider the different needs of new and old players, and ensure the game experience of all types of players, so that the game can have more players to play when it goes free-to-play, and the environment in the game can develop in a more balanced and healthy direction.</p>

    <title>Why Are Players Obsessed with Virtual Avatars: From Custom Character Creation to Fashion Outfits</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the Barbie doll, popular in the toy market in 1959 for its interchangeable clothing, to the QQ Show, familiar to Generation Z, with its customizable outfits and interactive expressions, and from early single-player dress-up games with fixed character images and clothing to highly customizable online character creation systems with hundreds of body parameters. The game format of dressing up characters has been popular from the beginning, and after becoming a virtual avatar online, it has developed rapidly due to its freedom of appearance customization, and has gained a lot of attention and recognition from players. </p>

<hr>
<p><em>Early Barbie dolls with various career images</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In 2023, after the first cloud character creation experience of <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game was launched, it set a record for simultaneous online players within ten minutes. The topic of “part-time game character creators earning over 10,000 yuan per month” was once on the Weibo hot list, attracting widespread attention and discussion. The hottest character creation data in the official character creation station has more than 50,000 downloads, and the sharing and exchange of character creation data among active players in social media has become a daily routine, which shows that there is a huge demand for character creation among players in the game.</p>
<p>Why can character creation, as a form of shaping virtual images, trigger a player experience frenzy and demand far beyond everyone’s expectations? It is also worth thinking about why selling game fashion and appearances has become a business model accepted by players around the world. Why are players willing to pay for some high-quality and exquisite fashion that can only be worn in virtual images?</p>
<p>Next, this article will start from the psychological connection between the player and the game character, and analyze the reasons why players are so concerned about the fashion, character creation and other appearances of game characters.</p>
<h2 id="I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars"><a href="#I-Game-Characters-are-Players’-Virtual-Avatars" class="headerlink" title="I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars"></a>I. Game Characters are Players’ Virtual Avatars</h2><p>The avatar identification theory proposes that in the game environment, players project their self-identity onto the game character through interaction with the game character, forming a special psychological connection.</p>
<h3 id="The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar"><a href="#The-Origin-of-the-Term-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="The Origin of the Term Avatar"></a>The Origin of the Term Avatar</h3><p>The original Zelda game first allowed players to customize the protagonist’s name, and subsequent games gradually began to allow players to customize the protagonist’s clothing and appearance. Later, it was collectively referred to as: Avatar system. The word Avatar comes from Sanskrit. In Hinduism, Avatar is a special ability user who can change his image, and is generally regarded as the image of gods in the human world. That is to say, the game character, that is, the avatar, is the digital representation of the player, and the player imagines and experiences the emotions and viewpoints of the character from the game character.</p>
<h3 id="Avatar-and-Projection"><a href="#Avatar-and-Projection" class="headerlink" title="Avatar and Projection"></a>Avatar and Projection</h3><p>Freud’s theory of personality structure believes that a person is composed of three parts: id, ego, and superego. The “id” follows the pleasure principle and contains a group of chaotic, instinctive, and suppressed desires. The “ego” follows the reality principle and satisfies the needs of the id under the conditions of real environment and moral standards. The “superego” follows the moral principle and contains moral ideals and conscience.</p>
<p>However, in real life, many desires of the id are restricted and cannot be realized. For example, office workers cannot travel and enjoy the beautiful mountains and rivers as they wish, but they can log in to the <em>Justice Online</em> game in their spare time and explore mountains and rivers in the dreamy and beautiful environment, so that their leisure exploration desires can be satisfied in another way. </p>

<p>The same is true in terms of appearance. For example, the <em>Justice Online</em> mobile game fashion [Star Palace] Pegasus skirt’s elegant and gorgeous design and court style can enable players to realize the dream of becoming a gorgeous female star that is difficult to achieve in daily life. It is the existence of a virtual avatar. It allows the desires for unfulfilled behaviors and appearances to have an object of projection and another possibility of realization. </p>

<h2 id="II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification"><a href="#II-Character-Appearance-Promotes-Avatar-Identification" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification"></a>II. Character Appearance Promotes Avatar Identification</h2><p>Studies have shown that avatars are not only seen as characters temporarily manipulated by players, but players also regard avatars as part of their self-concept. So how does this psychological connection explain players’ obsession with appearance and character creation?</p>
<p>The similarity between the virtual avatar and the player in terms of physical appearance, personality characteristics, race, etc. can promote the realization of avatar identification. When players choose or customize virtual images in the game, they are often based on the psychological mechanism of self-identification and projection. They hope to show their personality, interests, or ideal self through the character image in the game. This is why most players’ game character creation results have characteristics that are in line with their own aesthetics and character style settings</p>
<p>The game has developed a function in the character creation module that allows intelligent character creation based on pictures uploaded by players, allowing players who are not good at character creation to restore their beauty in the game with the help of AI tools. In addition, many players upload not photos of celebrity beauties, but their own photos. In the game, players actually carry out a kind of emotional projection by choosing or customizing the appearance of the character. With the support of AI technology and the addition of exquisite costumes in game design, virtual characters can be infinitely close to a player’s ideal image of themselves. What players project is the beautiful image they want to become, as players say: “Pinch yourself into a beautification, and what you pinch out is what I hope to grow into.. </p>

Specific Appearance is a Mask to Switch Identities"></a>III. Specific Appearance is a Mask to Switch Identities</h2><p>In the virtual world of online games, players project the desires they want to satisfy in the id, and the images they have not pursued in reality, onto the avatar.</p>
<h3 id="The-Proteus-Effect"><a href="#The-Proteus-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Proteus Effect"></a>The Proteus Effect</h3><p>The Proteus effect shows that when individuals are given specific character traits, they tend to behave in a manner consistent with those traits. This phenomenon originally came from the sea god Proteus in ancient Greek mythology, who had the ability to change his appearance, so the word “Proteus” is also used to refer to “ready to change shape and personality at any time”. In the game, by choosing or customizing the appearance and dress of the character, the player is actually setting a specific character image for himself, and showing the corresponding behavior pattern under this image.</p>
<h3 id="The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image"><a href="#The-Mask-Function-of-Character-Image" class="headerlink" title="The Mask Function of Character Image"></a>The Mask Function of Character Image</h3><p>We can regard such a specific appearance image as a kind of “mask”, which is a symbol and sense of ritual to switch identities, and it is also a prop to increase the immersion of the new identity. In <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, a national style martial arts game, in addition to the antique scenes, the ancient style appearance of the characters also allows players to quickly feel that they can travel to ancient times, and Ning Hongye’s blindfolded cloth strips and capable and neat fashion can also allow players to substitute into a brave and decisive swordsman identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F36a6b2fb-cdc3-47f4-9d7c-9e6e15be79ee.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>《Naraka: Bladepoint》 Ning Hongye</em></p>
<hr>
<p>And when this “mask” does not meet the player’s conditions for identity setting, there will be a sense of incongruity. Therefore, in the design of game fashion, not only should we start from the era background and identity of the game character itself, but also combine the player’s inherent cognition of the character or a certain type of image to think.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Game characters are players’ virtual avatars in another world. Appearance customization and other features can promote players’ identification with the avatar. Players will invest their imagination of their ideal self in the avatar. Different appearance images are like a mask, allowing players to be more deeply immersed in the role of the game.</p>
<p>Of course, such projection cannot explain all players’ appearance settings for game characters. Perhaps in the eyes of some players, game character creation and fashion matching are a way of personalized self-expression. By choosing different appearances and dresses, players can show their uniqueness and creativity.</p>

    <title>Unveiling the Design Behind Horror Game Jumpscares and Players&#39; Cognitive Load</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Horror works often use jumpscares as one of the basic building blocks of horror. This technique uses sudden scene changes and sound effects to make the player or audience “jump.”</p>
<p>Christopher Robert Cargill, screenwriter for the <em>Sinister</em> film series, explained the principle of jumpscares: “Jumpscares work because there’s misdirection. A successful jumpscare is like a magic trick. I’ll make you look over here, and I’ll do something over there, and then suddenly—bang!—something will scare you.”</p>
<p>As early as the 1976 film <em>Carrie</em>, the jumpscare at the end made the audience shudder: when the audience thought everything was over and saw Sue peacefully visiting Carrie’s grave with flowers, they would be scared by the hand that suddenly came out of the grave. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F32fb979f-fdb6-4fa8-8bc8-55add5a7f41d.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Jumpscare in 《Carrie》</em></p>

<p>Similar jumpscare designs are also common in game scenes. In horror games, players usually perform a distracting task, such as finding items or solving puzzles, and the jumpscare will come at this unsuspecting moment. In the game <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, released in 2021, you can see players being startled by zombies that suddenly appear with the music while exploring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2F4ff818e6-f886-4458-9982-46576c7428b6.gif/size/"></p>

<p>At the end of 2023, a horror game <em>Lethal Company</em> exploded among game streamers, winning the Steam “Better With Friends” award of the year, and the highest daily views on Twitch reached 190,000. Kelsey Raynor, an editor at VG247, pointed out, “…although the blocky graphics may make the game seem incomparable to other horror masterpieces, <em>Lethal Company</em> still fascinates a large number of fans, and its weird aesthetics is obviously part of the game’s charm.” Gabriel Moss, an editor at IGN, also mentioned, “ <em>Lethal Company</em> is already a sensory miracle in a sense.” The success of <em>Lethal Company</em> is also due to jumpscares. In Twitch live broadcasts, you can often see streamers being scared by spiders that appear from nowhere while doing tasks. In the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, we can also see players use the scene to artificially create some “jumpscares” to bring extra game fun: the Tianhai master hidden in the grass gives the unsuspecting Kurumi a little “surprise”. </p>

<h2 id="I-Research-on-the-Relationship-Between-Jumpscares-and-Cognitive-Load"><a href="#I-Research-on-the-Relationship-Between-Jumpscares-and-Cognitive-Load" class="headerlink" title="I. Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load"></a>I. Research on the Relationship Between Jumpscares and Cognitive Load</h2><p>Generally speaking, the purpose of horror games is to allow players to experience thrills, and jumpscares achieve this by putting players in a state of physiological arousal: usually under the stimulation of jumpscares, players will experience increased heart rate, sweating, blinking, and heavier breathing. These physiological arousal responses are actually our body ensuring our safety when potential high-risk stimuli (such as gunshots) appear. For example, an increased heart rate is actually to improve our motor ability to avoid danger; blinking is to protect our vital visual organs; and sweating and heavier breathing are side effects of the sympathetic nervous system being upregulated.</p>
<p>One of the key factors influencing physiological arousal is cognitive load. Cognitive load refers to the proportion of the human brain’s information processing system that is occupied. The heavier the cognitive load, the less energy we have left to use.</p>
<p>Based on the influence of cognitive load on physiological arousal, researchers Thomas Terkildsen, Lene Engelst, and Mathias Clasen from Aarhus University in Denmark proposed the hypothesis that “cognitive load is also related to the final effect of jumpscares” and conducted a systematic study on this hypothesis. The researchers decided to simulate different levels of cognitive load through four memory training sessions of different difficulty levels, and to determine whether physiological arousal and psychological arousal were brought out by jumpscares by measuring electrodermal activity graphs and having players self-report their psychological responses.</p>
<h3 id="Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity"><a href="#Experimental-Environment-High-Fidelity-Graphic-Horror-Game-Developed-Using-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity"></a>Experimental Environment: High-Fidelity Graphic Horror Game Developed Using Unity</h3><p>In order to give the experiment participants an immersive experience, the researchers developed a high-fidelity graphic horror game using the Unity game engine. The researchers believe that developing a new game is necessary because this can ensure that the tasks used later to simulate different levels of cognitive load can be seamlessly integrated into the game and its narrative to maximize the realism of the research.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the player wakes up from a nightmare in a small, dimly lit room. With a loud knock on the metal door, a guard appears and tells the player that it is time for the test. The player is taken out of the room and along a long corridor with cells on both sides. The guard leading the way drags another guard out of the cell, covered in wounds and blood. Eventually, the player reaches the room next to the cell where the injured guard was seen. The layout of the entire room was inspired by a similar scene in the popular horror game <em>A Chair in a Room</em> by Wolf &amp; Wood. There is a blank Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)* on the table in the room, next to a small plastic container containing two pills. A doctor behind the glass window instructs the player through the intercom to take the pills and sit in the chair in the middle of the room to start the test. The projector on the wall starts to work… </p>

<p><em>Left: Scene in 《A Chair in a Room》; Right: Scene in the Game Used in the Experiment</em></p>
<hr>
<p>* The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed by Professor Nasreddine in 2004 and is a rapid screening assessment tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The cognitive domains assessed include attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstract thinking, and calculation and orientation. The time it takes for a therapist to complete the MoCA assessment is approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load"><a href="#Tasks-to-Simulate-Cognitive-Load" class="headerlink" title="Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load"></a>Tasks to Simulate Cognitive Load</h3><p>After guiding the player to the task through the game, the researchers set up four cognitive load intensity environments for 60 players: zero cognitive load, low cognitive load, medium cognitive load, and high cognitive load. During the test, a series of different patterns will be shown to the players, and the players need to remember the position of the blue squares in the patterns. The rounds in which the blue squares to be memorized appear are incremented according to the cognitive load intensity group.</p>
<p>As the task progresses and the intensity increases, the distance between the patterns that the player needs to remember and the current time increases, the difficulty of memory gradually increases, and the player’s cognitive load also gradually increases. The jumpscare suddenly appears in this task: a grinning monster will yell and interrupt the current memory task, rushing to the player. </p>

<h3 id="Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results"><a href="#Measurement-Tools-and-Experimental-Results" class="headerlink" title="Measurement Tools and Experimental Results"></a>Measurement Tools and Experimental Results</h3><p>In this experiment, the researchers mainly measured the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player’s self-reported psychological arousal:</strong> Measured using the Self-Assessment Manikin, a graphic-based questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective physiological arousal:</strong> Measured by electrodermal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Player’s subjective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured using the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire.</li>
<li><strong>Objective cognitive load intensity:</strong> Measured by the performance of completing the cognitive load task (accuracy and reaction time to choose the answer).</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment showed that the manipulation of cognitive load intensity was effective: both objective reaction time and subjective reports showed that cognitive load was indeed different under the four experimental task conditions. As cognitive load gradually increased in the four experimental conditions, the physiological arousal produced by the jumpscare also increased. This coincides with the hypothesis of the experiment.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the player’s self-reported psychological arousal did not change significantly with the change of cognitive load. The researchers said that this is likely because the reactions caused by jumpscares are difficult to detect through conscious awareness; there are also many other studies in related literature showing that emotional and physiological “stimulation” cannot be accurately captured by people in the form of self-reports. </p>

How to Better Apply “Jumpscares” in Game Design</h2><h3 id="Appropriate-Level-of-Scare"><a href="#Appropriate-Level-of-Scare" class="headerlink" title="Appropriate Level of Scare"></a>Appropriate Level of Scare</h3><p>For the game industry, the research by researchers at Aarhus University points out that unpleasant experiences in games can sometimes better allow players to gain pleasure, but it should be noted that when using negative emotions with unpleasant feelings, the scale should be grasped. The relationship between fear and pleasure is usually an inverted U-shape. Only when there is an appropriate amount of horror can the player experience be maximized. Too low or too high horror may be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Some overseas players have expressed problems on forums about the poor experience caused by horror games being too scary; for example, some players on Reddit said that Laura’s part in <em>The Evil Within</em> made them feel very tormented. In the use of jumpscares, the dosage also needs to be controlled. Some games will overuse this technique, which will cause the jumpscares to lose their effect over time; some players also said that the use of jumpscares in <em>Prey</em> is just right, and only one powerful scare is enough to make people remember it. </p>

<h3 id="Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios"><a href="#Reasonable-Usage-Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="Reasonable Usage Scenarios"></a>Reasonable Usage Scenarios</h3><p>In horror games, scaring players unexpectedly by letting them concentrate on puzzles, tasks, and other plots can greatly enhance the experience of horror. Game developers have already unintentionally applied this.</p>
<p>Of the more than 10,000 games under the “Horror” tag on the Steam store, more than 3,000 also have the “Puzzle” element tag. In the new game <em>Content Warning</em> released in 2024, the developers increased the cognitive load by letting players act as photographers in the game plot, enhancing the stimulation of horror scenes.</p>
<p>In horror games, the use of jumpscares is reasonable and natural, but how to use the jumpscare technique in non-horror themed games is relatively vague. In games where players can interact with the environment and other players, jumpscares can actually be used by players. Returning to the action of players hiding in the grass in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> mentioned at the beginning, it is precisely because the creations in the environment can be utilized that players are given room for self-expression and creation. When the cognitive load is high, the effect of this jumpscare will also be enhanced. Just as if a hidden player suddenly appears next to a player who is concentrating on picking up equipment, the effect of the jumpscare will be very strong. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240716%2Fa412e815-a71d-4d64-a058-d0f72d1f1aa2.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>In the Game 《Content Warning》, Players Act as Cameramen for Paranormal Event Streamers</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The use of jumpscares is very extensive in games. A good jumpscare can make players feel excited and memorable. Researchers at Aarhus University proposed the hypothesis that the level of cognitive load will affect the player’s experience of jumpscares, and verified this hypothesis through a horror game combined with a memory test.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that the higher the cognitive load, the stronger the stimulation felt by the player when experiencing jumpscares. Based on this conclusion, we can more cleverly combine the plot, tasks, or puzzle-solving components in the game with jumpscares to bring players a more interesting game experience.</p>

    <title>Rejecting Stereotypes: What Kind of Game Characters Can Best Capture Players&#39; Hearts</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167413.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Games, as an important social medium, have one of their most important functions: the ability to quickly mobilize people’s emotions in a short period. In many games, one of the most common elements that mobilize players’ emotions is the game character. Because whether it is deeply exploring the plot or experiencing intense battles, the first thing players come into contact with is the character.</p>
<p>So what kind of game character can best capture the player’s heart in the first place? An important point is to enable players to truly immerse themselves in the role and experience the game immersively during the game, that is, to quickly enter a state of flow. The state that people show when they are focused on something is called flow by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. For example, when an artist is creating, when a player is engrossed in a game, their energy is completely invested in it, and at the same time, they have a strong sense of excitement and fulfillment. This is also why we sometimes play a game so “selflessly” that we ignore the passage of time.</p>
<p>When we talk about game characters, there are many ways to express the dimensions that are often mentioned. This article will focus on the visual image, persona, personality and other aspects of the character to explore what kind of game characters can capture the player’s heart and leave a unique and vivid impression.</p>
<h2 id="I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character"><a href="#I-The-External-Image-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="I. The External Image of the Character"></a>I. The External Image of the Character</h2><p>External image usually refers to the character’s shape, appearance, physical attributes, etc. When first getting to know a character, the first thing a player sees is their external image, and whether the player likes the character or not is often initially judged at first sight. Only when there is initial goodwill towards the character will there be an interest in further understanding the character.</p>
<p>For example, during the promotional period before the official launch of the character Ji Yingying in the game <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, even in just 20 seconds of the trailer CG, players couldn’t resist her “smile back”, and almost couldn’t forget her face at first sight. An amazing first impression also laid a good foundation for Ji Yingying’s continued high popularity. After her hero’s actual gameplay demonstration was released, the skill effects based on the Wuchang Lock and Nether Fire also brought players a hearty battle experience, enhancing the sense of satisfaction from multiple senses.</p>
<p>Another example is YORHA No. 2 Type B (2B), one of the protagonists of <em>NieR: Automata</em>. She is the most popular character in the game and the most beautiful character in the hearts of players. Short white hair, blue-grey eyes, wearing a black blindfold (standard military goggles), carrying a silver-white samurai sword behind her, coupled with a black Gothic-style dress, the cool image surprised everyone as soon as it appeared. In addition, she always covers her eyes with a black half-face blindfold, revealing only a little bit of her face, which also casts a mysterious veil over this character. The form of wielding a giant weapon in battle, the agility, and the elegant action design, combined with the setting of a mecha-girl, are even more eye-catching.</p>
<h2 id="II-Character-Persona-Tags"><a href="#II-Character-Persona-Tags" class="headerlink" title="II. Character Persona Tags"></a>II. Character Persona Tags</h2><p>Giving characters some specific persona tags can enhance the richness and three-dimensionality of the characters and help establish psychological identification with players. This is the core process of closely connecting the player’s heart with the character, and it is also a crucial part of driving the player’s preferences and decision-making and other psychological mechanisms. When a character has prominent traits, it is easy for players to establish a good impression of them.</p>
<p>For example, previously, on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, the official released a vote, allowing players to choose the best series of games and characters in their minds. Among them, Emet-Selch from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> ranked first in the number of votes. One of the reasons why he is so popular with players is his distinctive and contrasting personality.</p>
<p>First of all, when he first appeared, the initial impression he gave players was a puzzling and very indifferent villain image. But with more in-depth contact and understanding later, his completely opposite gentle and careful side will gradually be revealed. Combined with his personal experience: although he is good at conspiracy and has killed many people, his inner obsession is ultimately just to find his relatives and revive his compatriots. This kind of flesh-and-blood, and very contrasting personality makes players love and hate him, and leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>Taking Ji Yingying as an example, in the story background of <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, she is the most outstanding ghost messenger of the Wuchang Division, and she is a daunting existence in Morus Isle. Her hero introduction describes her as, “The infernal fire from the netherworld will burn all those who have betrayed her.” At the same time, her powerful combat ability also aroused the player’s admiration for the strong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, her persona is a “three-no girl”, silent, introverted, and keeping strangers away, which creates a sense of contrast, making players not only imagine that without emotions, it is hard to imagine how strong she would be. Looking at her life background, she was abandoned by her family since she was a child and bears the infernal fire of revenge as Bai Wuchang - players will always remember the character they deeply sympathized with. The persona tags discussed above can effectively evoke and strengthen the player’s emotions.</p>
<p>When a game character goes deep into the player’s mind, the character is established. We found in our research that when players examine their appearance and skins, they will also have a conventional answer based on the character’s image. Players are more concerned about the fit of fashion and characters. Factors such as lines, voice, hero stories, and character relationships that constitute the three-dimensionality of the character’s personality will affect the player’s judgment on whether a piece of fashion is beautiful and coordinated, and whether it has a story, and whether it can stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very risky to easily change the persona or create points that contradict the original persona. For example, the male character Temulch in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> was set from the beginning of the game as the bloodline of the prairie wolf king. “The legends of the ancestors are engraved in the mind, and the great glory is in front of you. The wolf from the prairie will run wildly again.” When he puts on a gorgeous dress, there are many players who stick to the persona, and they will feel very out of place.</p>
<h2 id="III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Inner-Character-of-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Inner Character of the Character"></a>III. The Inner Character of the Character</h2><p>Inner personality usually refers to the character’s internal tendencies and psychological characteristics, in terms of thinking and behavior towards people, things, and themselves. Just like the popularity of MBTI tests among friends in recent years, some personality tests are popular because they can give people more recognition and a sense of belonging from a psychological point of view. When everyone has their own “personality label”, they can quickly establish and deepen people’s understanding of each other.</p>
<p>People always yearn to understand their own hearts and are obsessed with finding similar souls that resonate with them. In the game, when a character’s internal personality is rich and three-dimensional enough, it also has the importance of conveying emotions. Players’ preferences for the personality traits of game characters also vary from person to person. These characteristics can be confident, humorous, vulnerable, kind, brave; they can be like Astarion in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, with a complex but unique personality; they can be like Geralt in <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, a mature and professional witcher, providing players with a deep sense of empowerment and helping them deal with powerful enemies; or you can also fall in love with Tali in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, and she doesn’t even have a face.</p>
<p>The above are examples of popular game character images with distinct characteristics that are loved by players all over the world. They are unique in the hearts of players and can also resonate strongly with players. At the same time, there are also many characters that are relatively unattractive. We found in player research that players will give feedback such as “no impression”, “not sure what he (in the story) wants to do, what is his goal”, “seems to see the shadow of several existing characters”, etc. for some characters who have a relatively low sense of existence in some games, that is, the characterization is “stereotyped”.</p>
<p>The stereotyped here does not refer to the visual image of the face. After all, many games now support personalized face customization. Players can customize their faces according to their own preferences, or even photos. The character stereotype discussed in this article focuses more on internal personality traits.</p>
<p>For example, in our research on a certain game, based on the data fed back by players, we compared the similarity of personality traits of two male characters and found that the similarity of the two in various dimensions is extremely high. This is also the reason why players are confused and ask “the two are indistinguishable”. If there is no difference in internal personality, it will be difficult to create a memorable character in the subsequent development of the character line.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In many scenarios where we usually contact users, whether it is about art or gameplay, players always tend to focus on characters. By shaping a memorable character, we can better understand the motivation and emotional connection of players to experience the game, and also better understand how to deepen the attraction and psychological identification of players in the game.</p>
<p>The above is a preliminary exploration of character shaping in game design. In addition, the character’s special skills, dubbing, etc. are also sufficient manifestations to help shape its three-dimensional image and identity. Of course, when talking about a certain character, we are definitely not looking at it from a single dimension. Only by fully considering many factors such as the character’s appearance, background, personality, and setting can we create a distinctive and beloved character.</p>

    <title>Help! Why is This Boss Music Stuck in My Head!</title>
    <url>/2024/04/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20240716_28584_1167423/</url>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240716/28584_1167423.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>In <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> previously released Mirror Pavilion dungeon, the music for one of the outer pavilion bosses, Nan Wenxue, left a particularly deep impression on players. It was able to effectively mobilize players’ emotions, making them feel the poignancy and murderous intent from Nan Wenxue, creating a strong sense of immersion.</p>
<p>This sparked thought: why do we have such a strong memory of some music? And how can this phenomenon be explained from a psychological perspective?</p>
<p>Comments on the NetEase Cloud Music page for “You Mei Xiao Gu” (Withered Plum Bone), the boss music for Mirror Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue are positive, and refer to it’s quality.</p>
<h2 id="I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work"><a href="#I-How-Attention-and-Memory-Work" class="headerlink" title="I. How Attention and Memory Work"></a>I. How Attention and Memory Work</h2><p>Before further explaining this phenomenon through examples, we need to first understand how the human brain’s attention and memory work.</p>
<h3 id="Memory"><a href="#Memory" class="headerlink" title="Memory"></a>Memory</h3><p>When receiving external information, this information first enters sensory memory, then enters short-term memory, and then enters long-term memory after a series of encodings.</p>
<p>Sensory memory usually refers to memory of about 1 second. Here, the brain will quickly perceive a large amount of information from the outside world, but at the same time, most of the information will also disappear quickly. Only the information that is noticed will enter short-term memory.</p>
<p>If we were to use a computer’s working mode as an analogy, short-term memory can be compared to cache. It passively stores the audio-visual information we hear and see, although it allows us to quickly retrieve memories. It cannot store a large amount of content at one time, and its capacity is relatively small.</p>
<p>Long-term memory is RAM. Comparatively, it can store more content and has a larger capacity, but it requires us to deliberately and actively save information, and the process of saving information is relatively time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="Attention"><a href="#Attention" class="headerlink" title="Attention"></a>Attention</h3><p>Everyone’s brain has a certain amount of “cognitive resources”, and exceeding the limit will cause “cognitive load.” In the case of a large amount of information constantly stimulating the brain every minute and every second, how does the brain process this information to avoid cognitive load?</p>
<p>The answer is through “attention.” Attention has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> The brain will selectively attend to some information while ignoring other information.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The brain will eliminate irrelevant stimuli to ensure that information is concentrated.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> The brain’s operation is linear, so “attention”, which is very important in the process of filtering information, also needs to remain stable for a certain period.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Often, we are not fully invested in a single event. When doing two or more things at the same time, it will involve the allocation of attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was mentioned above that the brain will eliminate irrelevant information stimuli, so how does the brain reduce interference?</p>
<p>The human brain has an area specifically responsible for suppressing irrelevant interference input. When the auditory area and the visual area are triggered at the same time, the prefrontal cortex will selectively inhibit the relatively less important area according to the importance of the information. By suppressing the information flow of the unimportant area, the information flow of another area will become relatively more prominent.</p>
<h2 id="II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories"><a href="#II-How-Does-the-Brain-Remember-Music-And-How-Does-it-Retrieve-Musical-Memories" class="headerlink" title="II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?"></a>II. How Does the Brain Remember Music? And How Does it Retrieve Musical Memories?</h2><p>After understanding how the brain works in attention and memory, let’s look at how the brain remembers music.</p>
<p>When playing games and listening to some game music with specific tonality, we use short-term memory more, in which “short-term musical memory” plays a key role.</p>
<p>What the brain remembers is not a complete melody, but the harmonic structure carried by the melody. In the previous article, “<em>How Games Control Your Emotions Through Music</em>,” it was mentioned that harmony will determine the emotional color of the melody to a certain extent. Whether it is happy or sad, excited or relaxed, and harmonic progression will constitute the development direction of the music, whether it is moving towards the climax or coming to the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, our brain will remember this harmonic context, and will further understand the melody heard based on this harmonic context.</p>
<p>In the process of remembering music with only one tonality, it is normal to have a few unclear memories. Switching to the scene of recalling and retrieving musical memories, the brain will try to fill in this note in the process of outlining the melody. The logic of filling in is based on the melody contour, and a relatively close alternative note is located from the tonality constituted by the harmonic context to fill in this vacancy.</p>
<h2 id="III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering"><a href="#III-Battle-and-Exploration-What-are-Players-Listening-to-and-Remembering" class="headerlink" title="III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?"></a>III. Battle and Exploration, What are Players Listening to and Remembering?</h2><p>In our previous research, we found that in most cases, players tend to not care about the specific details of the battle music, but just “listen to a sound”, or more accurately, listen to the “emotional atmosphere.”</p>
<p>So, why is there this phenomenon?</p>
<p>During battle, there will be many changes in vision, such as the attack direction of the big boss and the operations of teammates. At the same time, hearing will also continue to transmit various battle information, scene information, and so on. Under the bombardment of a large amount of information, in order to avoid cognitive load, the brain will allocate cognitive resources from top to bottom, choosing to focus attention on the more important battle and ignoring other information, so as to better adjust battle strategies based on information changes.</p>
<p>Zooming in on the brain’s operation, at this time, the prefrontal cortex will inhibit part of the auditory information flow, so that the visual information flow is more obvious and easier to remember.</p>
<p>At the level of conscious awareness, auditory attention is more biased towards listening to the content of teammates opening the microphone, and at the same time, background music will be ignored, because it is necessary to cooperate with teammates. But this does not mean that the background music is useless. At this time, the role of the background music is more biased towards the subconscious level, mainly acting on the arousal of emotions, making people feel the passionate atmosphere of the battle.</p>
<p>This leads to another question, why do some people feel that playing music while playing games interferes with their strategic thinking, while others feel more passionate and immersive?</p>
<p>In fact, everyone’s cognitive resources are different, some are high and some are low, and there are individual differences. Among them, people with larger cognitive resource capacity can process more information at the same time. At the same time, everyone’s focus on information is also different. People who care about the sense of immersion brought by game music will be more easily immersed in the emotional atmosphere created by the music, while people who don’t care may feel that the music interferes with their thinking.</p>
<p>But no matter which group of people, everyone’s primary memory is the emotional atmosphere brought by the music, not the details of the music. Generally speaking, without prompts, players cannot directly recall what the battle music is like.</p>
<p><em>Justice Online Mobile</em> has corresponding city music for different cities. Some will change with the day and night and the weather, so that you can be immersed in it when exploring or running around.</p>
<p>Unlike battles, when exploring and running around, cognitive resources are no longer highly concentrated on a certain matter, players are more open to information, and their attention will also be more dispersed. At this time, they can pay attention to some small designs, whether it is scene sound effects such as birdsong, water flow, or background music. This is also why players are more likely to recall exploration music with distinct melodic characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered"><a href="#IV-Why-Can-Some-Boss-Music-Be-Remembered" class="headerlink" title="IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?"></a>IV. Why Can Some Boss Music Be Remembered?</h2><p>Returning to the original question, why can the music of <em>Justice Online Mobile’s</em> boss Nan Wenxue be remembered?</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody"><a href="#Vocal-Theme-Based-Main-Melody" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody"></a>Vocal Theme-Based Main Melody</h3><p>In this boss music, the production team incorporated vocal design. This means that when players listen to this piece of music, in addition to the music information, there is actually text information, and the brain will also process the lyrics in an additional layer. This makes the human voice stand out among a bunch of instruments. This strong contrast effect will also make it easier for players to notice the human voice, and then notice the music.</p>
<p><em>The south branch is withered, the wind holds the snow and turns, don’t let it fall. The fragrance disappears, the plum blossoms scatter, and the floating life follows the flowing water. - Lyrics of “You Mei Xiao Gu”</em></p>
<h3 id="Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics"><a href="#Coordination-with-Gameplay-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics"></a>Coordination with Gameplay Mechanics</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous article, the effect of music and gameplay is often 1+1&gt;2. On the basis of excellent gameplay mechanism design, Nan Wenxue’s vocal singing coordinates well with the gameplay. It roughly appears shortly before and after the appearance of the Peach Blossom Girl, setting off the atmosphere and making players feel the “killing intent” from the boss.</p>
<p>Why is it effective at this node? This is because here, except for individual players who need to focus on the position of the boss, most of the others are in a state of pure fighting without needing to think too much about battle and positioning strategies. Players’ cognitive resources still have a lot of spare capacity at this node to notice corresponding design details.</p>
<h3 id="Repetitive-Stimulation"><a href="#Repetitive-Stimulation" class="headerlink" title="Repetitive Stimulation"></a>Repetitive Stimulation</h3><p>The Mirror Pavilion·Outer Pavilion’s Nan Wenxue, the dungeon boss, is both an interesting and challenging dungeon boss in this raid. Because there is a certain degree of difficulty, and the dungeon is an important channel for equipment upgrades, players will continue to participate in this dungeon. The impressive female vocal singing of “You Mei Xiao Gu” is also set in the boss stage that players will experience. This means that players will generally experience this piece of music once every time they participate in this dungeon. Like the learning process, this repeated emphasis and stimulation can deepen the brain’s memory of the music segment, thereby making the music more likely to enter long-term memory, making people have an impression and remember it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, understanding the player’s attention and memory patterns, including the neural operation process of the brain, can assist the development team in designing details in the game that better meet the needs of the experience. In the process of designing music, it is also necessary to linearly and structurally understand the process and rhythm of the entire gameplay. Doing the right design at the right node can achieve better results.</p>

    <title>Why Do Players Turn a Blind Eye? Novice Guide Design from the Perspective of Attention Mechanisms</title>
    <url>/2024/03/25/netease-ux-articles/news_20240717_28584_1167643/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167643.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When players experience a new game or new gameplay, they often complain that the game’s guidance is unclear and they don’t understand how to play. On the other hand, game designers feel very confused. The game clearly has a large section of gameplay introduction, so why do players feel that the guidance is not enough?</p>
<p>Why do players always “turn a blind eye” to the carefully prepared novice guides by developers? Do they really not see it, or do they not want to see it? In a previous article, we mainly analyzed what kind of information is easier to be seen from the perspective of involuntary attention.</p>
<p>First, let’s do a brief review.</p>
<p>What is attention? -&gt; If the human brain is a TV, external information is various TV programs, and attention is the process of selecting TV programs. What is involuntary attention? -&gt; Those that do not require willful effort and can be naturally noticed by people. For example, a ringing mobile phone in a quiet conference room is hard not to be heard.</p>
<p>What information is easier to attract involuntary attention, that is, easier for players to see (pay attention to)?</p>
<ul>
<li>The characteristics of the information itself are different and differentiated. Such as novel stimuli (more pictures than words, more words than pictures), stimuli with higher relative intensity (such as darkening for emphasis), and motion changes (such as dynamic effects).</li>
<li>The information fits the person’s own state, interests, and needs. For example, when a new player encounters a brand-new function that needs to be used immediately, he will have a clear need for the novice tutorial. At this time, the pop-up guide will be more easily noticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the characteristics of attention, the inspiration for novice guide design is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast effect 1: More pictures, look at words; more words, look at pictures; highlight the differences.</li>
<li>Contrast effect 2: Less is more; the more blank space, the easier it is to be seen.</li>
<li>Multi-channel presentation: Visual + auditory multi-sensory presentation.</li>
<li>Proximity effect: The closer the picture and text are, the better the learning (any form of prompt clues can guide players to pay attention to the key points faster).</li>
<li>People’s eyes tend to follow arrows, and hand-drawn arrow prompts can be used to highlight key points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in the actual novice guide design, if the planner makes it according to the above standards, can it be ensured that the player can see it? Not necessarily. Specific problems still need specific analysis. In this article, we will present several conclusions that are different from the previous sharing, and will still explain why this happens from the perspective of attention.</p>
<h2 id="I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”"><a href="#I-Is-it-Really-“Text-is-Inferior-to-Tables-Tables-are-Inferior-to-Pictures-and-Pictures-are-Inferior-to-Videos”" class="headerlink" title="I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?"></a>I. Is it Really “Text is Inferior to Tables, Tables are Inferior to Pictures, and Pictures are Inferior to Videos”?</h2><p>Let’s start with a non-prize quiz. In the following guidance screen about Parry in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, where do you think the player’s visual focus will be. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fed990d34-bf9b-4198-b60e-341aea98b4bd.webp/size/" alt="Image of Naraka: Bladepoint Parry tutorial"></p>
<p>There will mainly be 3 answers to this experiment. One answer is on the character, one answer is on the restraint relationship diagram in the upper left corner, and a few answers are on the controller diagram in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, none of the above answers are correct. The eye-tracking test results show an answer that surprises everyone. Players only saw the animation at the beginning, and then focused on the text below, and did not watch the animation demonstration again. And this is not just an individual case of one player. In the test of 10 players, 7-8 similar guide video contents in the game guide, the player’s focus is not on the video, but on the text.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Generally, we will think that vivid and visual pictures and personally demonstrated videos will be more focused on by players, and they will have more patience to watch them than boring text introductions, helping players learn some complex operations.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another type of attention - “voluntary attention”. In contrast to “involuntary attention”, “voluntary attention” is a conscious act of paying attention that requires willful effort. When we need to learn complex knowledge, we need the real “top student” type of “voluntary attention” to play.</p>
<p>As the eye-tracking data shows, at the beginning of the video, the player’s attention is attracted by the animation. At this time, “involuntary attention” is playing a role, which is in line with the principle that the higher the stimulus intensity, the more attention it attracts. But soon, the player finds that he can’t understand this animation. At this time, voluntary attention comes into play. For voluntary attention, familiarity is an important influencing factor. The more familiar things are, the faster the processing starts, and the easier it is to attract people’s attention at this time. Compared with the animation that cannot be understood, Chinese characters are still more familiar, so the brain is more inclined to process the text below, which is more helpful for understanding this guide. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2d43d828-ea76-44ba-b3f2-df5c60af63aa.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking data"></p>
<p>For the same guide, if it is shown to players who are already familiar with <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, their focus will be more on the video, because they are familiar with the various elements in the video and can quickly understand the information conveyed by the video interpretation. But for new players, the attack moves, blue light, and white light elements in the video are all unfamiliar, let alone understanding the relationship between them through interpretation.</p>
<p>Under the same conditions, the information transmission effect of video is better than that of text, and it is more able to capture attention. This is beyond doubt. This is also a place where it is easier to fall into the trap. Believing in the video theory transmission effect of video pictures, but ignoring the understandability of video pictures, will make players turn to complex text guidance with a low ceiling but a lower threshold.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for designers to find that players have this unexpected behavior through their own tests, because the familiarity of planners and players with this video is completely different. Combining the characteristics of voluntary attention, in this guide video, if the presentation of key elements or relationships can be matched with brief text descriptions that players are more “familiar” with, it can better capture the player’s attention and also help understanding.</p>
<h2 id="II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It"><a href="#II-No-Matter-What-You-Put-I-Can’t-See-It" class="headerlink" title="II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?"></a>II. No Matter What You Put, I Can’t See It?</h2><p>Does this desperate situation really exist? Yes, it does. Are players really so reluctant to read guides? No, sometimes they really don’t see them.</p>
<p>In the attention processing mechanism, we have a theory called the cognitive resource theory. This theory regards “attention” as a set of cognitive resources or cognitive abilities to classify and identify stimuli. These cognitive resources are limited. When the stimulus is more complex or the processing task is more complex, the more cognitive resources are occupied. When cognitive resources are fully occupied, new stimuli will not be processed. This is what we call the state of “turning a deaf ear to the outside world and concentrating on reading only the books of sages”.</p>
<p>At this time, it is easier for us to understand why the eye-tracking trajectory diagram of the following novice guide appears like this. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7de25631-f8af-4107-8428-a29489b15c60.webp/size/" alt="Image showing eye-tracking on a tutorial screen"></p>
<p>From this picture, we can also find that the player’s focus is completely concentrated on the surrounding scene, that is, the things that are highly related to the current task. They are focusing on performing the task at hand, so they turn a deaf ear to such obvious guidance prompts above. In the actual test, most of the players also stated that they did not see the prompt text above.</p>
<p>But for us who are looking at such pictures, because we don’t need to consider the tasks that the player is currently performing, the attention processing resources are not occupied. The guide text above, “Double-click the A+D keys to roll in the specified direction and avoid the slash”, is very easy to attract our attention, and almost no one will not see it.</p>
<p>The more cognitive resources are occupied, the more concentrated the attention, and the smaller the scope of attention. In tasks that require identifying the details of things, the human field of vision is only about 1-2 degrees. This size is about the size of your thumbnail when you hold your arm parallel. When we get information, we don’t look at ten lines at a glance, but our eyeballs are constantly turning and shifting the point of gaze.</p>
<p>When the eyeball is stationary, the human visual coverage is about 220 degrees. But when you need to identify the details of things, such as reading text or recognizing a logo, you need to continuously rotate your eyeballs to project the position you want to know to the fovea of the retina (Fovea - a small depression in the center of the retina cone cells, that is, the macula, which can perceive the richest image details). This is also the principle of the eye tracker. The eye tracking system is mainly capturing the gaze points and the transfer behavior between gaze points. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F97bdeb4b-0109-4a9a-a3bb-fa446080f050.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of human eye and visual field"></p>
<p>In response to this situation, a common practice is to place auxiliary information as much as possible within the range of concentrated attention. For example, the head-up display of a car. When driving, the attention is mainly focused on observing the road conditions, and the gaze range is mainly concentrated in the windshield range. The information on the traditional car dashboard is relatively difficult to be noticed during driving. Therefore, some new cars try to display driving assistance information on the windshield. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0cf66d46-3c68-4a97-89e0-294700a8a8fc.webp/size/" alt="Example of a car&#39;s head-up display"></p>
<p>In games, some better practices are to put the guide on the task-related gaze path, or next to the character or weapon that the player gazes at more, which can ensure that the prompt information can be noticed more effectively. For example, <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> places button prompts on the target scene; <em>God of War</em> displays some operation guides next to the axe. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F4dc46fcc-ef41-497e-8f5a-225d4d4086e5.webp/size/" alt="Examples of in-game guides placed near points of interest"></p>
<h2 id="III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character"><a href="#III-The-Scope-of-Attention-is-So-Small-Do-All-Guidance-Information-Need-to-be-Stacked-Near-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?"></a>III. The Scope of Attention is So Small, Do All Guidance Information Need to be Stacked Near the Character?</h2><p>From the above several cases, we understand that when players concentrate on performing game tasks, the scope of attention is very small. The gaze point is mostly distributed near the task-related path and the character. So do all prompt information need to be stacked near the character? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Here we need to introduce another attention processing theory, the dual processing theory of attention: human cognitive processing has two types: automatic processing and conscious controlled processing. The former is not limited by cognitive resources, does not require attention, and can be carried out automatically; the latter is limited by cognitive resources, requires attention, and can be continuously adjusted according to changes in the environment. That is, when performing multiple activities at the same time, one or more of them have become automated processes, and individuals no longer need to consume cognitive resources, and they can concentrate their attention on other cognitive processes. Consciously controlled processing may be transformed into automatic processing after a lot of practice. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F2b4eaad9-5b58-42a2-9913-1a997cf0d8d2.webp/size/" alt="Diagram of the dual processing theory of attention"></p>
<p>Therefore, although our processing resources are limited, if we can automatically process more information, we can cover more and more comprehensive information. Experience can transform the content of voluntary attention into automatic processing, which does not occupy cognitive resources, so that more information can be processed.</p>
<p>In games, the most obvious manifestation is the difference in the gaze range between veterans and novices. As can be seen from the figure below, the visual range of both new and veteran players is centered on themselves. However, the visual attention range of veteran players is larger, accounting for more than 1&#x2F;3 of the whole; the visual attention range of novice players is smaller, about 1&#x2F;4 of the whole. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7fc21bf4-ec25-43ef-b26f-a2da0a52c62b.webp/size/" alt="Comparison of gaze range between novice and veteran players"></p>
<p>Veterans can achieve a good degree of automatic identification of tasks such as character movement and combat, so they have more attention resources to notice other information prompts that appear on the interface, and can also gaze at a larger range of interface information to complete tasks when needed, such as the skill bar at the bottom.</p>
<p>This attention processing feature has many inspirations for developers. First of all, for the design of novice guidance prompts, the position of guidance prompts does need to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. Secondly, the interface display information is gradually unfolded step by step, so that players can adapt first, become proficient in a basic content, so that they can gradually enter automatic processing, and then enter the next. By gradually transforming the information processing process of some basic tasks into automatic processing, the amount of information that novice players can process at the same time is gradually expanded.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, let’s make a review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text is not necessarily inferior to pictures, because in real information processing tasks, voluntary attention mainly plays a role, and familiarity is an important influencing factor. Users tend to process familiar information sources that are more conducive to information processing. Therefore, if the video format is used for guidance, the understandability of the video content presentation is very important.</li>
<li>When performing real tasks, the gaze range is very limited, and the gaze range is strongly related to task-related elements, such as being more concentrated near the character and task path. Therefore, some important information that needs to be noticed by the player can be displayed in these areas.</li>
<li>The information processing range of novices is very limited. First, the position of guidance prompts needs to be combined with the characteristics of novice gaze range, and as close to the character itself as possible. At the same time, it is necessary to gradually display information, so that players can gradually process automatically and expand the range of information that can be processed at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, in the novice guide design, it is also necessary to consider the player’s own information familiarity and the characteristics of attention in actual task execution. It is not possible to simply rely on common image display rules, and specific analysis should be made for specific situations.</p>

    <title>How Can Game Plots Better Elicit Player Empathy</title>
    <url>/2024/02/26/netease-ux-articles/news_20240717_28584_1167669/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167669.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone suffers, and no one readily accepts tragedy. In today’s era, people are tired of and even disgusted by consistently happy endings in stories, while also complaining about “knife-inflicting” (creating sad, regretful scenes) plots in entertainment content.  Especially in games, which are meant for entertainment, the inclusion of one heartbreaking scene after another often sparks heated discussions among players.</p>
<p>When players immerse themselves in the game world, savoring the scenes created and the stories written by the developers, they generally ask: Do developers have to “stab” players a few times in the process to get their kicks?  When “stabbed” (seeing heartbreaking scenes), it often triggers strong emotional reactions in players. Why do developers choose to deliver endless “knives” despite the potential backlash?</p>
<h2 id="I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game"><a href="#I-Emotional-Establishment-Within-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game"></a>I. Emotional Establishment Within the Game</h2><p>The plot in a game has always been responsible for creating a sense of immersion for the player.</p>
<p>Game characters are, after all, virtual. So how do you make players emotionally resonate with them and fully remember them? The emotional ups and downs and character settings brought about by the plot are particularly critical. The establishment of player emotions requires a fluctuating process. They may forget the lines a character once said, but they will definitely find it difficult to forget the scenes that can bring them intense emotional fluctuations. Therefore, developers sometimes choose to create many sad scenes in the plot to promote the development of the plot, arouse changes in player emotions, and further portray the characters.</p>
<p>Like Haurchefant in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, from an insignificant stranger at the beginning, to gradually forming a connection, and finally being killed by a sneak attack. Thinking of the shelter he once provided, the two cups of hot drinks he held, covering the player’s retreat at the Skyfire Locks, standing up for the player in the trial duel, and even personally training a Chocobo for the player, any user would find it difficult to forget this guy who always calls you “my friend.”</p>
<p>There is a Zeigarnik effect in psychology, which refers to the fact that people tend to remember unfinished things or interrupted work, and there is an inherent concept of having a beginning and an end in human nature, so they will be obsessed with things that have no results. When players do not see the content they expect, they will also remember it deeply. When the visual presentation and gameplay do not have much room to stimulate, players will be distressed by the tragic fate of the characters in the plot, thereby mobilizing emotions, and naturally they can remember this feeling, and thus remember this character and this plot, and even like these characters. Perhaps only a deep “feeling of being stabbed” can indicate that the plot has truly touched the player’s heart.</p>
<h2 id="II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”"><a href="#II-Can’t-We-Have-“Sweetness”" class="headerlink" title="II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?"></a>II. Can’t We Have “Sweetness”?</h2><p>So why must it be sadness and regret? Can’t “sweetness” (designing many beautiful scenes and bridges) trigger emotional fluctuations in players?</p>
<p>Perceived control in psychology believes that people believe that they can control themselves and the places, people, objects, emotions, and activities around them. When facing a stranger, if he is doing well, the emotion we first produce is to compare. When you feel that you can’t be as good as the other person, you will have a lower sense of control, and it is easier to develop an inferiority complex, which in turn leads to jealousy or other bad emotions. On the contrary, if this person has gone through hardships and has a bumpy fate, what is more generated is sympathy, and further, a feeling of compassion.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the game plot alone, if a plot “has no knives”, the character has no changes, and everything is very good and smooth, the player may instead feel disgusted, unreal, and even more serious boredom. In games, NPCs and characters who are plain or live a happy life are often not remembered by us, and are more like passers-by.</p>
<p>Tragedy is always easier to touch people’s hearts and resonate with than comedy; that’s why it’s always said that the core of comedy is tragedy, otherwise how can a simple comedy move the audience, let alone make people talk about it with relish afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors"><a href="#III-Immersion-and-Mental-Anchors" class="headerlink" title="III. Immersion and Mental Anchors"></a>III. Immersion and Mental Anchors</h2><h3 id="Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions"><a href="#Immersion-Interweaving-Positive-and-Negative-Emotions" class="headerlink" title="Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions"></a>Immersion: Interweaving Positive and Negative Emotions</h3><p>Developers often say that they want to give players a sense of immersion, using visuals and plots to instill emotions into the player’s mind. Immersion is a very mysterious concept. During the game experience, players have positive and negative emotional fluctuations. When positive emotions are dominant, they will experience a focused pleasure and have the motivation to invest in it, entering a state of enjoyment. For example, when a player finishes a plot in the game or passes a relatively difficult level, they burst out with a positive emotional catharsis, and thus experience a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>However, games are often not all about positive emotions. It is necessary to allow players to have a certain degree of negative emotional fluctuations to avoid fatigue and boredom caused by long-term positive feelings. If negative emotions are created through game mechanics and difficulty, it is easy to cause imbalance, leading to direct churn and discouragement. Developers usually adopt more gentle, more widely accepted tragic plots to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch"><a href="#Mental-Anchor-The-Player’s-Emotional-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch"></a>Mental Anchor: The Player’s Emotional Switch</h3><p>Mental anchor is a form of conditioned reflex, which refers to “the connection between a certain mood in a person’s heart and a certain action or expression, resulting in a conditioned reflex”. In short, it’s like a switch. When we see this thing, we will have different moods associated with it. We can call such things that can stimulate special feelings, whether good or bad, mental anchors. It’s like a bookmark placed in the heart, which can be used when needed, and the psychological state at the time of setting the mental anchor can be retrieved. Therefore, a mental anchor is more like a “re-experiencing”.</p>
<p>And in games, similar to gameplay types, when we mention a type, we will think of its representative work; in the plot, when we see a flag, we will think of a tragic ending. Just as assassination and parkour gameplay will remind us of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, Cthulhu investigators will easily remind us of <em>Bloodborne</em>, and when we see several corpses and last words in a shelter in <em>The Last of Us</em>, we will naturally depict in our minds a story of a poor person who had to kill a child to prevent the child from becoming a zombie. The game provides classic elements, combines them with various elements in the scene and level, and activates the mental anchors in the player’s mind through scene scheduling, creating an illusion of the plot in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor"><a href="#How-to-Build-a-Mental-Anchor" class="headerlink" title="How to Build a Mental Anchor"></a>How to Build a Mental Anchor</h3><p>When enough immersion and positive emotions are created in the early stage, and the emotional fluctuations are large enough, a positive mental anchor is buried. The player has positive expectations for the plot and creates their own fantasy of the plot. Or it may further arouse the player’s curiosity, resulting in the idea of “there must be a pit buried here, I must play it to find out, to see if it is the same as I thought”. In the later stage, when “handing out knives” to design heartbreaking scenes, players will also perceive something wrong because of other memories before, activating the mental anchor, and “Run, there are knives here” is the most intuitive feeling.</p>
<p>The strong contrast and the conflict between mental anchors cause strong emotional fluctuations in players. Grasping this emotional change of the player, it makes the player have a deep memory point for this plot and this character. This buries the next mental anchor, so that the next time the player encounters an emotional switch, they will have a sense of déjà vu: “Hey, have I experienced this before?”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the interesting plot is never in the game, but in the player’s mind.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In the final analysis, designing “knives” such as tragic plots is just a tool. With a good knife, the characters will be vividly portrayed, the plot conflicts will also be vividly depicted, and the player’s heart will also be “stabbed” severely. After all, although heartbreaking scenes are bitter, they are indispensable. If the “knife” is not given properly, it is just to stimulate the player’s emotions by “tearing up the canvas”, which is more like simply spreading unreasonable negative emotions, with a mentality of “Didn’t expect it, look how bitter it is”, and most players may not buy it. A person who can’t draw a circle with a pen and casually draws an abstract painting will not become a master of art.</p>
<p>The essence of the game is still to be happy, right?</p>

    <title>The Secret of Open World Map Design: Multi-dimensional Application of Icons</title>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2 id="I-Task-List-What-Icons-Need-to-be-Designed-for-the-Map-System"><a href="#I-Task-List-What-Icons-Need-to-be-Designed-for-the-Map-System" class="headerlink" title="I. Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?"></a>I. Task List: What Icons Need to be Designed for the Map System?</h2><p>Unlike traditional paper maps, the icon design in the game map interface needs to include various forms of content other than geographical location information. The following list basically encompasses all icons that may appear in an open-world map interface.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular locations:</strong> Mark locations in the game world that players can explore.</li>
<li><strong>Character&#x2F;Important item locations:</strong> Indicate the current location or direction of characters or important items.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Travel points:</strong> Allow players to teleport directly from their current location to the indicated location.</li>
<li><strong>Reminder markers:</strong> Alert players to unfinished tasks or unclaimed items.</li>
<li><strong>User-defined markers:</strong> In some games, players can choose an icon provided by the map system to mark a specific location.</li>
<li><strong>Direction indicators:</strong> Crucial in vast environments; some maps have compass-like icons.</li>
<li><strong>Crosshair and cursor:</strong> Tools for selecting locations, commonly used in maps navigated with a controller or keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>External map information:</strong> Provides details such as longitude and latitude, weather, and time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="II-Prerequisite-for-Ensuring-Immersive-Experience-How-to-Improve-Icon-Usability"><a href="#II-Prerequisite-for-Ensuring-Immersive-Experience-How-to-Improve-Icon-Usability" class="headerlink" title="II. Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?"></a>II. Prerequisite for Ensuring Immersive Experience: How to Improve Icon Usability?</h2><p>Virtual game environments, similar to real-world scenes, interact with people through various “touch points”.</p>
<p>In a game scene, touch points can be various special scenes, objects, or characters (like NPCs). Maps typically present these touch points to the player in a 2D or 2.5D format. When players switch from the map interface back to the 3D game scene, a sense of disconnect is inevitable. Therefore, the higher the usability of the icons, the more players can focus their attention on the game scene, enhancing their immersive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately"><a href="#Easy-to-Understand-Convey-Meaning-Quickly-and-Accurately" class="headerlink" title="Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately"></a>Easy to Understand: Convey Meaning Quickly and Accurately</h3><p>To avoid players repeatedly switching between the map and the game scene to confirm information, ensuring a continuous gameplay experience, developers need to make it easy for players to understand the connection between map icons and touch points in the game scene.</p>
<p>The essence of icon design lies in symbol selection. Appropriate symbols make it easier for players to understand the meaning of icons, thus making their meanings easier to comprehend. Additionally, icon materials should align with the game world’s setting, ensuring clarity while considering the narrative.</p>
<p>For example, consider icons with a “teleport” function. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the teleport icon (fast travel) resembles a location marker on a modern map. In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the teleport icon is based on the shrines in Hyrule. In <em>Elden Ring</em>, the teleport icon (Site of Grace) is drawn from the actual Site of Grace in the game world. These icons not only allow players to quickly understand their meaning but also enhance the game’s narrative. </p>

Adding text prompts to icons is the simplest way to enhance learnability.</p>
<p>Firstly, text content should minimize redundant information, as extra text doesn’t exist in the real world, and excessive text descriptions disrupt the player’s sense of realism and immersion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6c8304e6-4eef-4dfe-a229-2e7ac86f66cf.webp/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, only a keyboard icon and the word “Teleport” are used as an instruction.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Secondly, ensure that text prompts are visually easy to read, reducing the player’s visual load and improving reading efficiency. The text’s presentation should also be consistent in design with text in other game interfaces, ensuring that the text system as a whole is easily understood by players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fbff87078-fcf5-4c1b-ae43-880cb5c8696e.webp/size/"></p>

Players mainly interact with icons using a mouse, keyboard, or controller thumbstick (excluding tablet games for now). Therefore, icon size is a crucial factor in determining operability.</p>
<p>Obviously, larger icons are easier to select. However, to display as much information as possible and avoid excessively large icons affecting the player’s visual and operational experience, icon design must first determine its activation area.</p>
<p>In the most common interface where a mouse is used to select icons, due to the mouse’s high precision and speed, icons can have a smaller activation area to increase overall map information density.  When using a keyboard or controller thumbstick, the selection process is more complex, requiring larger icon activation areas. </p>

Developers must first strike a balance between conveying information and providing an immersive experience, then determine how to make icons appropriately attractive.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, icons have low attractiveness, blending closely with the map background. Players must focus more on identifying terrain features (like mountains and rivers), inadvertently building a stronger macroscopic memory of the game environment. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the attractiveness of different icon categories should be differentiated. Levels should be assigned based on factors like access frequency and contribution to game progress. However, too many levels can lead to sorting confusion. More levels also imply a wider range of visual weights, potentially making some icons too jarring or too subtle, increasing the player’s visual burden. Typically, icon attractiveness levels should not exceed four. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F22c42936-10bb-4f5c-a250-19701fe25761.webp/size/"></p>

Linear level design in traditional games is akin to a movie edited by a “director” and presented to an audience; players passively receive the story. Open worlds, however, require players to actively explore the story. Each player has a unique exploration style and journey, which is the charm of open-world games. </p>

<p>During their exploration, different players will ultimately create unique maps. Players project their personality, preferences, and emotions onto the map, forming a personal profile. Some might use stamps to mark important resource points, while others might highlight scenic or interesting locations. Each player’s unique map becomes a vessel for their experiences and memories after completing the game.</p>

The least correlated and most common icons provide location information, usually presenting scene details to the player through images and text. Next are teleportation points; players select and click an icon to travel to the corresponding location. The most strongly correlated icons are location markers. Since players need to find the marked location in the scene, the design of these icons must closely integrate with markers within the scene.</p>
<p>In <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, players have six differently colored map pins to mark locations. When switching to the game scene, using the telescope reveals corresponding colored light pillars, guiding the character to the marked location.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the design of these icons is inspired by the light pillars in the scene, enhancing clarity and integrating well with the environment. Furthermore, the glowing effect on the icons mirrors the light effects in the scene. </p>

    <title>Silent Communication in Games: An Essential Tool for Creating Immersive Experiences</title>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167686.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Language communication is an indispensable form of interaction between players in the game. In different types of games, players can use language communication for socializing, commanding, collaborating, and other behaviors.</p>
<p>There are many definitions of language. This article adopts the definition of “viewing language as a system of human communication, either spoken or symbolic.” Therefore, the language communication referred to in this article includes both voice communication and text communication between players in the game. For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, players can turn on the microphone to discuss tactics, and in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, players can use text to chat privately in the chat system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F430e70ae-18d9-4a9b-add4-c39f6efdb973.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The text chat system of “Final Fantasy XIV”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, language is not the only way for players to communicate. There are also a variety of non-verbal communication forms in the game. The interactive forms of non-verbal communication are usually related to gameplay. For example, in some games, the mechanics determine that players can only communicate with each other through the environment. For example, in some games, developers have removed language-related communication methods, and players can only “communicate” through non-verbal character interaction behaviors in the game.</p>
<p>In addition, non-verbal communication methods will also appear in competitive games as an auxiliary communication method for language communication. The diverse expressions of non-verbal communication between players not only enrich the interactive forms in the game, but also help the game achieve smoother social interaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F3f9b37cd-be12-4880-9200-dad7d792316e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Final Fantasy XIV” use emotional actions to interact</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Compared with the directness of language communication, non-verbal communication methods bring players into the virtual avatars in the game (the characters controlled by players in the game), further increasing the player’s sense of game immersion. At the same time, restrictive non-verbal communication methods also control the input of malicious voice communication to a certain extent, reducing the negative emotional experience of players.</p>
<p>This article will discuss the non-verbal communication methods in the game, combined with some game cases, to analyze the considerations of its experience design.</p>
<h2 id="I-Non-Verbal-Communication-Methods-Between-Players"><a href="#I-Non-Verbal-Communication-Methods-Between-Players" class="headerlink" title="I. Non-Verbal Communication Methods Between Players"></a>I. Non-Verbal Communication Methods Between Players</h2><p>Generally speaking, non-verbal communication methods can be divided into the following three categories.</p>
<h3 id="Preset-Game-“Commands”"><a href="#Preset-Game-“Commands”" class="headerlink" title="Preset Game “Commands”"></a>Preset Game “Commands”</h3><p>This refers to the command integration prepared in advance by the game producer according to the game play and game content. Players can effectively choose from the limited preset commands and share them with teammates.</p>
<p>Its manifestation in the game is: these preset expressions are classified, one type is the in-game “commands” that are strongly related to the game mechanics, and the other type is the expression commands that express the player’s emotions. For example, the marking system in the game, players can use the mark to tell teammates the enemy’s location, share or ask for supplies from teammates without turning on the microphone. </p>

<h3 id="In-Game-Character-Interaction"><a href="#In-Game-Character-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="In-Game Character Interaction"></a>In-Game Character Interaction</h3><p>Refers to players manipulating the characters in the game to interact with actions and expressions, in a way that is consistent with the game’s world view, deepening the player’s experience of being in the game world.</p>
<p>Its manifestation in the game is: this communication method usually appears in two types of games, one is the interaction of expressions and behaviors of characters manipulated by players in MMO games (Massively Multiplayer Online), and the other is the online version of multiplayer games, where players pass information or emotions through behavior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F7ff9e8d9-4dc1-4f36-ae14-964c716fdcf3.gif/size/"></p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Environment-Mediated-Communication"><a href="#Environment-Mediated-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Environment-Mediated Communication"></a>Environment-Mediated Communication</h3><p>Refers to the communication method that uses the environment as a medium and changes the environment as a way. It allows players to leave continuous changes in the game environment and communicate information by changing the environment.</p>
<p>Its manifestation in the game is: co-building buildings, signs, road signs, etc.</p>

Therefore, designers can try to reduce the cognitive load from the following two aspects to improve the efficiency of players’ non-verbal communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve the recognition of “commands”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take the commands in <em>Overcooked! 2</em> as an example. These commands are presented in the form of UI. Among the six icons, the four icons of faucet, knife, plate, and pot correspond to the four game states of the player in the game, namely cleaning, preparing, serving, and cooking. The visual performance of these four command icons is consistent with the logic of using these items in real life, and has strong recognition, which can quickly tell teammates what they are currently doing, and teammates can adjust what they want to do accordingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F23303806-886d-4757-8d38-984978fdd40e.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Six expression commands and the animation effect of the garbled icon in “Overcooked! 2”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The icon of garbled characters is special. It expresses the player’s current irritable mood with interesting UI animation effects. It is the most realistic portrayal of the player’s mood when there is no time to cook in a time-critical situation. The icon design of this garbled code usually appears in animation or games. It is used here on the expression command, which allows players to quickly associate the emotions conveyed behind this icon and has high recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve the efficiency of players issuing “commands”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the game, not only the visual effect of the “command” itself will affect its use experience, if the player needs to remember too many non-verbal interaction methods, and the interaction efficiency is low, it will also reduce the game experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, designers can preset the expressions that players may use in the game and limit the number, and reduce the frequency of clicks and the steps that need to be remembered to achieve the interactive purpose as much as possible, so as to improve the efficiency of players from searching to issuing “commands”. For example, in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, players can quickly get the interactive actions they want to do to other players with only three clicks, taking into account the interactive relevance between social systems and facilitating immediate interaction between players. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6c3b84fc-6e9f-4535-a31d-44dbd237f7f4.gif/size/"></p>

<p><em>The steps for players to perform basic actions on other players in “Final Fantasy XIV”</em></p>

<h3 id="Provide-Release-Channels-In-Game-Character-Interaction-Design"><a href="#Provide-Release-Channels-In-Game-Character-Interaction-Design" class="headerlink" title="Provide Release Channels: In-Game Character Interaction Design"></a>Provide Release Channels: In-Game Character Interaction Design</h3><p>Games provide a relatively safe and controllable environment. In the game, players manipulate their own characters and can try behaviors that they dare not or cannot do in real life, and freely express inner emotions such as excitement, happiness, anger, and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Players communicate with each other through physical behaviors and expressions between characters in the game, which not only creates virtual interpersonal relationships and satisfies their own social needs, but also appropriately releases these emotions that cannot be released in reality. As a designer, when designing the communication experience of this part of character interaction, you can start from the following two directions to improve the efficiency of non-verbal communication between players in the game, so that its release role as a channel is better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design in conjunction with the game’s worldview</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, the behavior and expression design of the characters need to fit the game’s worldview itself. For example, the “lift-up” action in <em>Ollie &amp; Bollie: Outdoor Estate</em>. This set of actions is based on the attributes that the character controlled by the player is a small puppet and the limbs can be stretched to a certain extent. It is an action required by the gameplay. At the same time, the friendly action design itself is also in line with the game’s own settings and casual style. This two-player interactive action improves the player’s sense of immersion, and also accelerates the player’s understanding and use of the action. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa8e15ec4-4042-44ba-b9a9-83fd3caaafbd.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>The two-player “lift-up” action in “Ollie &amp; Bollie: Outdoor Estate”</em></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stimulate players to expand interaction methods independently</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On this basis, the behavior and expression design of the characters needs to be able to provide basic emotional expression, and also allow players to spontaneously expand interaction. For example, in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, in addition to providing players with actions to express basic emotions to other players, it also expands interaction methods for multiple participants such as hide-and-seek, long table magic, cloak magic, and shared spaces. The official provides some interactive actions, allowing players to interact spontaneously under the interaction rules. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fd398eba7-087c-4d2b-8d92-bb30cc42e280.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Sky: Children of the Light” use magic to interact in a “hide-and-seek” mini-game</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, designers can create some simple interactive actions without special meaning, making them a medium of narrative or communication, allowing players to give them rich and new meanings. For example, in <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can also make different sounds by clicking on their own character with a short press or long press. The sound made by a short press is also often used by players to imitate the behavior of “talking” to strangers, and even to imitate interesting behaviors such as “quarreling” and “persuading” between friends. From a design perspective, increase the frequency of use of these character behaviors, let players interpret and use this behavior in their own way, and customize it as a special communication method between friends to meet the player’s own social needs. </p>

<h3 id="Utilize-Mental-Models-Create-an-Environment-Based-Communication-Platform"><a href="#Utilize-Mental-Models-Create-an-Environment-Based-Communication-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Utilize Mental Models: Create an Environment-Based Communication Platform"></a>Utilize Mental Models: Create an Environment-Based Communication Platform</h3><p>Communication with the environment as a medium is a special non-verbal communication method. In the game, it is shown that players are allowed to leave continuous information in the game environment, which is a communication method based on the game mechanism that can modify the environment. It is also because of its special communication medium that the design of this communication method also relies on the designer’s use of the player’s mental model. The full use of mental models can minimize the player’s understanding cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental model: A model created by the brain based on what we have known and experienced. After the brain creates a model, it will react immediately without thinking when encountering a similar situation in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combination of mental model and game worldview</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the game <em>Death Stranding</em>, all players cannot appear in the game world at the same time, but they can refresh after a period of time and use the equipment and tools left by other players at a certain location. For example, ladders and ropes on cliffs, and even highways and bridges built by multiple players together, can also freely create signs or be reminded by signs created by others - reminding players of the nearby environment. The interactive design of these equipment, buildings, and markers makes full use of the player’s mental model of these common items in the real world. On this basis, combined with the game worldview, it reduces the player’s learning cost in the game, and allows players to quickly understand the way to use items in the game.</p>
<p>For example, the red BT mark (Beached Things: In the world view setting of <em>Death Stranding</em>, after a human dies, the body will turn into BT within 48 hours, and BT swallowing a living person will cause voidout. Players swallowed by BT will be sent to the Seam). This mark is first based on the meaning of “danger” represented by red in real life, and then the icon of BT is drawn on this basis. The combination of the two has a special meaning that conforms to the game world view - there are BTs ahead. </p>

<p><em>Sign creation panel in “Death Stranding”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Provide limited and friendly interactive entrances</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the above conditions, as a designer, you can also choose to provide a relatively limited and friendly interactive “entrance”. Relatively “friendly” interactive behaviors are not only the bridge between players and games, but also the bridge of emotional communication between players. The “limited” non-verbal communication gives players as few choices as possible due to the limitation of interaction channels, which improves the interaction efficiency of players.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Death Stranding</em>, players can give likes for help from other players, and can also receive likes from other players by creating buildings and signs that are helpful to other players. In this process, only the “like” interactive entrance is provided, and the “like” behavior itself is also kind, and this interactive experience creates a relatively friendly player communication environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F6540e72f-28cb-4a99-839e-208fc7553058.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Sam, the character played by the player in “Death Stranding”, gives likes to other players’ signs</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>Sky: Children of the Light</em>, players can also share and display a video of their actions, speeches, piano playing, etc. to other players by using the “Memory Candle” magic item, and other players can also give likes through the “Memory Candle”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa2d75ab9-c6fe-4145-89a5-b0b6cd5a3330.gif/size/"></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Players in “Sky: Children of the Light” watch the “memories” left by other players in the realm and give likes</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At this time, “like” is no longer just an interactive entrance, but exists as an “emotional connection point” between all helped players and creators.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Non-verbal communication design is becoming increasingly important in games today. Players manipulate characters to interact non-verbally in the game, which not only strengthens the sense of game immersion, but also strengthens the social attributes of the game and improves the game retention rate. Therefore, designers need to optimize the experience design of non-verbal communication between players from different aspects, improve the efficiency of non-verbal communication, and further ensure that players can get a more easy-to-use, efficient, interesting, and autonomously expandable immersive interactive experience.</p>

<p><em>Machine Translated from Chinese to English</em><br><a href="https://ux.163.com/news/20240717/28584_1167718.html"><em><strong>Original article written by ThunderFire UX (NetEase)</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we collect various items and unlock new information in games, we often use a system that is not so attractive to players, but is very important - the Bestiary system. Setting up a Bestiary system is one of the most direct ways to reflect the worldview of the entire game. It can carry various character settings, achievement information, item map data, and so on in each game.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the design of the Bestiary, introducing different game cases for analysis, aiming to explore some important commonalities and advantages in Bestiary design, in order to provide some ideas and references for Bestiary design.</p>
<h2 id="1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems"><a href="#1-Definition-and-Types-of-Bestiary-Systems" class="headerlink" title="1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems"></a>1. Definition and Types of Bestiary Systems</h2><p>The concept of “Bestiary (pictorial book)” originally refers to the creation of a general natural history book by drawing scientific illustrations of things in a certain field and adding corresponding explanatory texts. In many games, there are “bestiaries” with different or similar functionalities. In this case, it can be defined as “a collectible system that can collect, classify, display, and allow players to consult various item information obtained by players in various ways in the game.. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F451e98b5-0892-4f49-8984-3431946ba4e0.webp/size/" alt="《Pokémon Scarlet and Violet》 Pokédex"></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Bestiary system can present several main types according to their respective classification attributes. Here they are divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement Bestiary</strong>, which includes achievements, game endings, and CG collections, tending to collect certain results obtained by players;</li>
<li><strong>Collectible item Bestiary</strong>, such as weapons, costumes, recipes, plants, materials, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Text information Bestiary</strong>, such as some story background information, character information, and dialogue information obtained in puzzle games;</li>
<li><strong>Character Bestiary</strong>, including characters, creature settings, character information, display of unlocked new characters, and may be accompanied by other functions, such as a favorability system (such as in <em>Love and Sword</em> (Chinese Title: 遇见逆水寒), <em>Stardew Valley</em>);</li>
<li><strong>Other systems with Bestiary attributes</strong>, this type may not be a pure Bestiary collection interface, but it can bring players a similar experience, such as clothing and furniture decoration systems, card collection interfaces, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa119104e-9bfe-4016-8718-6b053824e1ca.webp/size/" alt="Stardew Valley Character Gift Guide Bestiary"></p>
<h2 id="2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design"><a href="#2-Bestiary-System-and-Collection-Gameplay-Experience-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design"></a>2. Bestiary System and Collection Gameplay Experience Design</h2><p>Bestiary design involves one of the main gameplays: collection gameplay, and the Bestiary system is the most intuitive way to display the results of collection gameplay.</p>
<p>Adding collection elements to the game is an important way to enhance the player’s sense of accomplishment and prolong the player’s game retention time. Take open-world games as an example. In open-world games, if there are only main quests and side quests, more costs need to be invested in writing the storyline, which will consume more time and budget. Therefore, placing some collection elements as “seasoning” and “content filler” is a time-saving and labor-saving solution. It can directly increase the content of the game, guide players to explore the map, and add fun to the open-world experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F28aa85c7-1da0-4abe-8646-1dd7ef815488.webp/size/" alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey Map Collectible Markers"></p>
<p>In the book “The Overspent American”, Harvard University economist Juliet Schor proposed a new concept - the “Diderot Effect” or “matching effect”, which specifically refers to the phenomenon that people continue to configure items that match them after owning a new item to achieve psychological balance.</p>
<p>Therefore, many games use people’s “matching psychology” to stimulate players’ desire to collect, add matching designs, sets, and other concepts, and consider how to design the Bestiary system from the perspectives of player psychology and interactive experience.</p>
<h3 id="Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles"><a href="#Arrange-Collectibles-According-to-Classification-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles"></a>Arrange Collectibles According to Classification Principles</h3><p>When designing, collectibles can be classified and arranged according to different types of labels. Collected collectibles are displayed in order, and uncollected collectibles appear in a semi-transparent, gray silhouette, or other unlocked way. In addition to making the items more intuitive and orderly, this can also make it easier for players to see how many things they may be missing in the same type of Bestiary, arousing players’ desire to collect. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F33fefec6-4748-407a-98ea-153916164810.webp/size/" alt="Famine creates a character dressing interface"></p>
<h3 id="Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”"><a href="#Make-the-Bestiary-More-Than-Just-a-“Bestiary”" class="headerlink" title="Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”"></a>Make the Bestiary More Than Just a “Bestiary”</h3><p>In games, how to greatly increase the frequency of use of the Bestiary and make various interaction processes more convenient and concentrated? The answer is to use a functionally integrated approach. In addition to the most critical Bestiary function, let some Bestiaries carry other functions, such as placing level, combat skill display, and promotion UI; placing character skin and clothing collections, store, and other page jump UIs.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, the hero display page clearly serves as a character Bestiary. In the interface, it can be seen that whether it is character information, combat strength attributes, and character skills, or related appearance changes and other functions, they are clearly and directly presented on the same interface. When players enter the character Bestiary, they mostly want to check other information related to the character. This is also a design method that conforms to the player’s interactive thinking. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F46d89aa8-d090-4205-8a91-7d0a92cc8f09.webp/size/" alt="Naraka: Bladepoint Hero Display Page"></p>
<p>At this time, the Bestiary system becomes an important part of the fully integrated game experience, rather than a dispensable independent interface. This Bestiary attribute system with comprehensive functions will become one of the key interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles"><a href="#Add-Path-Guidance-to-Collectibles" class="headerlink" title="Add Path Guidance to Collectibles"></a>Add Path Guidance to Collectibles</h3><p>There are two schemes for the path guidance of collectibles: one is to prompt or tell the player where to obtain the collectible, including map information or limited-time event information; the other is that after the player collects the item, the information related to the collectible will also be unlocked. After that, when the player wants to collect this item again, they can directly check the location information in the Bestiary. In survival adventure games, farming management games, and card games, adding path guidance to the Bestiary is a very common and important design method. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2Fa00bab7a-1275-44a9-8be5-a3853d92142c.webp/size/" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Bestiary Screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary"><a href="#3-Visual-and-Interactive-Experience-Design-in-the-Bestiary" class="headerlink" title="3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary"></a>3. Visual and Interactive Experience Design in the Bestiary</h2><h3 id="Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces"><a href="#Leverage-the-Advantages-of-Conventional-Bestiary-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces"></a>Leverage the Advantages of Conventional Bestiary Interfaces</h3><p>Many common Bestiaries are made by planar interface design methods. They can incorporate artistic and emotional understanding of the game background on the basis of concise and clear design. This design can make the Bestiary system not grab the attention of other interfaces. In other words, developers do not need this interface to be so attractive, but it must be harmoniously integrated into the game environment and maintain overall consistency with other interfaces of the same level.</p>
<p>For example, the construction and collection interfaces of <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> inherit the style of the game itself, using dark tones to set off the atmosphere, which is in line with the story background setting of the game; the UI size is prominent, and the distribution is simple and clear, and players can quickly find the items they want to click. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F3540e505-8c9f-41a7-8f5d-ace03a286dae.webp/size/" alt="*Cult of the Lamb*"></p>
<h3 id="Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion"><a href="#Use-Situational-Design-to-Enhance-Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion"></a>Use Situational Design to Enhance Immersion</h3><p>Most of the impressive Bestiary designs on the market, or the Bestiary systems in high-quality games in the hearts of players, have one thing in common, that is, they use the situational design of the game. The situational design of the Bestiary can be said to be centered on and aimed at highlighting and expressing the worldview, and is closely linked to the performance of the GUI. By packaging the interface in a way that conforms to and is embedded in the game background, players can have emotional resonance and recognition.</p>
<p>This kind of situational design can also be called scene-based design to some extent, because producers often use perspective scenes for specific performance. Generally speaking, its production process can be three-dimensional or two-dimensional, but from the perspective of the presentation results, their common feature is that the function of the Bestiary is placed in a three-dimensional scene. Among them, not only around the scene, but more emphasis on the sense of substitution, immersion, and atmosphere in the background of this worldview.</p>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a classic case of immersive situational Bestiary design. Its special feature is the use of a walk-in scene. A walk-in scene is a special category of scene-based Bestiaries. Players can operate characters to move and interact in the packaged Bestiary system, which generally appears in three-dimensional games. <em>Animal Crossing</em> cleverly packages the Bestiary into a museum that can be walked in. Players can display the collected items in the form of display and display. When players see that the fossil fragments collected on weekdays are spliced into complete fossils, and the aquarium and insect hall become colorful and vivid, they will feel that the time and energy they put into collection are very worthwhile. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F632955fc-a6db-47be-b0fa-2caea4fc6d9a.gif/size/" alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Museum Area"></p>
<p>Situational design can also be exemplified by Nintendo’s <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. In this game, players can use a vacuum cleaner to capture ghosts, and check the names and types of ghosts we captured in the doctor’s display room, and also see the different Bosses collected in the plot. In the interface, players can switch multiple glass sealed vessels left and right, which contain different collected ghosts.</p>
<p>Although the scene perspective is fixed and players cannot move, being able to manipulate the glowing glass jars that look like scientific laboratory glass jars still gives players a strong sense of atmosphere. The background setting and emotional response are well conveyed to the players through the scene. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F0c31837c-540f-4de7-87df-318d4fdc94b3.gif/size/" alt="Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3 Ghost Bestiary"></p>
<h3 id="Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers"><a href="#Reasonably-Choose-Special-Carriers" class="headerlink" title="Reasonably Choose Special Carriers"></a>Reasonably Choose Special Carriers</h3><p>Special Bestiary carriers actually exist in both planar types and situational types. The reason why they are analyzed separately is that this is a way to make full use of the Bestiary to increase the game effect.</p>
<p><em>The Forest</em> is a first-person open-world survival game. The protagonist survives in the primitive jungle in a plane crash accident, and the Bestiary design inside is also very worthy of reference. The designer combines all the important information that players must consult, such as weapon and material production methods, and jungle creature records, into a “survival guide”. Through the form of this special carrier, supplemented by the immersive first-person browsing dynamics, it can give a good sense of substitution, which is very in line with the game setting and the interaction is very convenient. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F60266013-c838-474f-9878-e8ab9460de7b.gif/size/" alt="The Forest Production Bestiary &quot;Survival Guide&quot;"></p>
<h3 id="Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs"><a href="#Handle-Interface-Interaction-Levels-According-to-Needs" class="headerlink" title="Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs"></a>Handle Interface Interaction Levels According to Needs</h3><p>In addition, the interaction level and different positions of the Bestiary in the game also have different effects.</p>
<p>Some games will directly place part of the Bestiary system on the main interface of the initial entry into the game, at the same level as the “save and load”, “start game” and other UIs. This is so that players can quickly check their gains when starting and ending the game. It also shows that this type of Bestiary system can generally be slightly separated from the main content of the game, and players can consult the Bestiary after playing.</p>
<p>Many Bestiary systems, especially the functionally integrated Bestiary systems mentioned above, will mostly be set at the same level as “vbackpack”, “character status” and other functions, in a conspicuous place on the game interface or set as a pop-up interface for commonly used keys. At this time, the primary purpose is for players to be able to find and use them in a timely manner. </p>
<p><img src="https://img.notionusercontent.com/ext/https%3A%2F%2Fnie.res.netease.com%2Fr%2Fpic%2F20240717%2F40a3364b-f8f9-43ae-aac4-144b4d7ab9f4.webp/size/" alt="Terraria toolbar and other Bestiaries are in a conspicuous position"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>A good Bestiary system design can be guided by the game’s worldview, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game world and enhance the game experience. As one of the important systems in the game, the Bestiary system can not only provide strategic guidance and collection value, but also enrich the content of the game and increase playability through different types of Bestiary presentations.</p>
<p>All in all, in the process of game production, Bestiary system design is essential to create an attractive game world.</p>
